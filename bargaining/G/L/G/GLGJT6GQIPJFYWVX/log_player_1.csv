"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk of the money to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving Bob 400,000$ and me 600,000$. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now, but I think we can do better 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 300,000$ is now worth 60% of the original 300,000$, which is 180,000$. Meanwhile, Bob's 700,000$ is still worth 700,000$.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I think I can do better than the 40-60 split from the first round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
