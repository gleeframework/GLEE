Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Let's split it 90/10, and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is making it increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. It's better to secure at least 100,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
