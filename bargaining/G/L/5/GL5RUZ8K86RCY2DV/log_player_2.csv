Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Patience is wearing thin, let's end this 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting impatient, but the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While the value of the money decreases for both of us each round, it decreases faster for Alice. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting close to walk-away point 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's patience is wearing thin, and the deal is becoming less appealing for her quickly with each passing round.  If I reject this offer, there's a real risk she'll go even lower, and I'll be forced to accept a worse deal later, or we'll both walk away with nothing. It's better to take a slightly less favorable deal now than risk getting a much worse deal or no deal at all."
