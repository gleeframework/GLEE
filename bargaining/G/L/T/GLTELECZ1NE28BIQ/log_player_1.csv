"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from round 1 is no longer on the table, and Bob's new offer is more favorable to me than my original offer. I accept this offer.
