"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole thing. Don't bother responding.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split 60-40, fair share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm not sure I want to give him 60% of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a new offer for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this more moderate proposal!"
