"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair distribution while acknowledging the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split, reflecting the fact that the value of money is decreasing for me in future rounds. This split feels fairer to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
