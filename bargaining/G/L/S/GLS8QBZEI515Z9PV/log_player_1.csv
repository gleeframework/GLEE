"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the initial offer was too generous for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob wants a more uneven split this time around.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think it's still a bit too generous for Bob, considering the initial offer I made was already quite fair. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a toll, and the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split this time, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to accept a split that's even more skewed towards you. I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I think this is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to give up that much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think 30% is too low for me, considering the initial offer I made was already 80%. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, but I'm not giving up!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's call it a draw and split the remaining value of the money evenly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split this time, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally end the game."
