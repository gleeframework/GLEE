I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy. Let's see if he bites!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm going to try to push for a larger share again, but I'm also making sure to offer Bob a significant amount to avoid another rejection. I'm hoping that with the inflation pressure, Bob will be more inclined to accept a deal that favors me slightly more than his previous offer."

```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm adjusting my offer to account for the increasing inflation. This offer is still generous to Bob, but it allows me to secure a more substantial portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this deal."

```

I'm starting to feel the pressure from inflation, but I'm still holding out for a good deal. I'm adjusting my offer slightly down, but I'm still offering Bob a decent amount. I'm hoping that he'll recognize the value of this deal and accept it before the inflation becomes even more significant."

```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unfavorable, but I'm still going to reject it. We're in the late stages of the game, and the inflation is a huge factor, but I'm not going to settle for a bad deal just to avoid getting nothing. I believe I can still get a more favorable outcome."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm making one last push for a significant share, but I'm also acknowledging the increasing inflation by offering Bob a more substantial amount than in previous rounds. This is a high-risk strategy, but I believe it's my best chance to secure a decent portion of the money before the remaining rounds drastically reduce the value of my share."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

We're down to the wire, and inflation has seriously impacted my potential gains.  I'm offering a 50/50 split to Bob, hoping he'll accept it before the next round, where the value of my share drops even further.  It's a risky move, but I have to try to salvage something from this negotiation."
