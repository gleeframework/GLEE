"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me the majority and leaving Bob with a smaller share. I want to secure a good portion of the money quickly, knowing the value will decline for both of us in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation. I'm losing value at a slower rate than Bob, so accepting this offer now would mean a significantly smaller gain for me in the long run. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm proposing a 7000/3000 split. While I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer, I still want to secure a larger share to offset the faster inflation rate Bob is experiencing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is really starting to hurt and accepting this means I can secure a decent amount before the value drops even further."
