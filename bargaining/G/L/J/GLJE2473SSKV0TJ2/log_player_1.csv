"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we split this more evenly. This offer reflects that. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 95% share for myself, even if it's more even than my initial offer. I'll wait for a better proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer this time. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."
