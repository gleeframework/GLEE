"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money almost evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I want to try to get more than 49 dollars. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the decreasing value of money.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to offer Alice 45 dollars, while I take 55 dollars. My reasoning is that since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a larger share to offset the loss in value. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be fair again.  Inflation is hitting us both, so an even split might be the best option. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer of an even split, 50 dollars each. Since the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, I think it's a good idea to settle now rather than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds. An even split seems fair, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation."
