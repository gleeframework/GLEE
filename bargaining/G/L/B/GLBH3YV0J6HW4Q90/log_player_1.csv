"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000. You can't do better than this, can you?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  No need for games here. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of $900,000 is now worth $855,000. Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $500,000, which is worth $475,000 after inflation.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I could potentially get more in future rounds. But the even split does seem fair, and I don't want to risk getting less than this in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less after the first two rounds, my goal is to get as much as possible in the remaining 9 rounds.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're playing it safe with an even split, but I'm willing to take a risk. Take $300,000 or risk getting less.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money after four rounds of inflation. The initial $1,000,000 is now worth 0.95 × 0.95 × 0.95 × 0.85 = 0.73125, or 73.125% of its original value.

Considering this, my gain of $700,000 is now worth $511,875, and Bob's offer of $400,000 is worth $292,500.

While this offer is better than the even split, I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I still have 8 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal.

For now, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the current value of the money.

Since the money is worth 73.125% of its original value, my goal is to get as much as possible in the remaining 7 rounds.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still confident I can do better in the next rounds. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  We can both do better than the last few rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money after six rounds of inflation. The initial $1,000,000 is now worth 0.95 × 0.95 × 0.95 × 0.85 × 0.95 × 0.77 = 0.534225, or 53.4225% of its original value.

Considering this, my gain of $550,000 is now worth $293,812.50, and Bob's offer of $450,000 is worth $240,562.50.

This offer is similar to the previous one, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal.

For now, I'll decide to...
