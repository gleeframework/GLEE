Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I propose Alice gets $850,000 and Bob gets $150,000.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but still want to secure a majority of the money since the inflation rate is higher for Bob."
