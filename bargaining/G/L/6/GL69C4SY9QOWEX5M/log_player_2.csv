Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my last chance to propose, and the value is dwindling fast for me.  This offer still gives you a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
