"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can split the money fairly and move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split. Let's try this and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to propose an even split, but the numbers he provided are the same as my original offer, not an even split. I'll have to reject this offer since it's not a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll keep the same amount, but its value has decreased.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my gain. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, and keeping $480,000 for myself."
