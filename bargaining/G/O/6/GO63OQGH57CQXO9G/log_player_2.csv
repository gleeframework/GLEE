"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth less with each round. Even though Alice's offer is less than my previous offer, the inflation means I'll get less in the next round if I reject.
* **Fairness:** The offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise considering the potential for further losses due to inflation."
