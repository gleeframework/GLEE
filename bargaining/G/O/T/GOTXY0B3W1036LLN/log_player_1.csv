I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer.  I figure that giving Bob a small amount will make him more likely to accept, and I'll get most of the money. Let's see how this goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a clear power play by Bob, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since Bob seems to be taking advantage of the inflation. I'll try to secure a larger portion for myself, but still leave room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly playing hardball. He's taking advantage of the inflation and pushing for an extremely uneven split. I won't accept this, and I'll see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm sticking to my guns and offering a slightly better deal for Bob than last round. Inflation is hurting me, but I'm still trying to secure a decent amount for myself. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to agree before things get even worse for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is outrageous!  I'm losing more and more with each round, and Bob is pushing his luck. I'm not going to give in.  I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm feeling the pressure of the inflation, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. This offer is still giving Bob a decent amount while securing a majority for myself.  I hope he realizes that we're both losing out with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and I'm losing more and more with every round.  I won't accept this, even though I'm losing money.  I'm holding out for a better deal, even if it means we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm making a bold move here.  We're both losing too much money, and the stakes are getting higher.  This offer is an even split, and I believe it's the best chance we have of securing some money before the inflation completely wipes out our potential gains. I'm hoping Bob realizes this is the only way we both can benefit."
