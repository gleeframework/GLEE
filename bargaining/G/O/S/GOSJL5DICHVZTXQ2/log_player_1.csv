"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $750,000 and Bob gets $250,000. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to set the tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: Accept this fair offer and we can settle this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $400,000 is now worth less than I initially thought.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
