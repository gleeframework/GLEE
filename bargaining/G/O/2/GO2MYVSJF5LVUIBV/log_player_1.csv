"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective amount I'll get is 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000. Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}

This way, I'll get 45% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective amount I'll get is 350,000 * 0.727 (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%) = 254,950. Considering the offer, I'll accept this one.
