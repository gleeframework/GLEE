Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the time pressure and inflation working against me. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic move for Alice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Bob is heavily impacted by inflation. Each round makes the same dollar amount significantly less valuable to him. This puts pressure on him to make a deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  As time goes on, the potential gains for both parties diminish. It's in Alice's best interest to secure a reasonable amount sooner rather than later.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. He might become even more desperate and offer a much smaller amount, hoping Alice accepts out of fear of losing even more value.

Accepting 5500 dollars guarantees a reasonable gain for Alice, and avoids the risk of getting a much lower offer in a later round."
