"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but still leave you with a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing that I, Alice, take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob takes the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We'll both have a good chunk of cash this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about splitting it evenly, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial proposal. This way, we both get a decent amount, but I get a bit more.""}

I'm proposing that I, Alice, take 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob takes the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go slightly higher than our previous even split. This way, we can both still get a good amount, while acknowledging your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, especially since I'm getting a smaller share due to inflation. I think I can do better than this. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your previous offer. This way, we can both get a decent amount, and I'll still get a slightly larger share.""}

I'm proposing that I, Alice, take 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,500, and Bob takes the remaining 45%, which is $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. It's a fair split, and we can both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Meeting in the middle between our previous offers seems like a fair way to divide the money, considering the inflation and the negotiations so far."
