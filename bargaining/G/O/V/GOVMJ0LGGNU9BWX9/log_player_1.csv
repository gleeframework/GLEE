Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation. We both get a good share, and it avoids further rounds where the money depreciates even more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
