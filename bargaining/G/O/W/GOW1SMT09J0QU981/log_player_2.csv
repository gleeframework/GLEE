Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. Your last offer was ridiculous.  I'm proposing a more reasonable 60/40 split. Take it or watch your share shrink.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll meet you halfway this time. Let's split the money evenly.  It's still a better deal for me than letting the inflation eat away at my share further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
