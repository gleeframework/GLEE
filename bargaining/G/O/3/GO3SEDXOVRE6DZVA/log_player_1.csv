I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share. I figure he might accept it since it's the first round, and if he doesn't, I'll have more rounds to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, with the inflation factor, taking a 50/50 split in the second round seems like the best option.  It's better than potentially getting less in the later rounds due to the decreasing value of money."
