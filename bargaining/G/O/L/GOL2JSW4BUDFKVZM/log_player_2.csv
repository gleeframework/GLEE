"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, but I need to plan for the future. This offer gives me a bit more security.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value for me with each round. It's crucial to secure a larger share now.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering slightly more than Alice's previous offer for myself might make her more inclined to accept. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also prioritizes my needs in the face of the shrinking pot. 
* **Future Rounds:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to be more aggressive in the next round to compensate for further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but my offer is more than fair considering the decreasing value. Let's close the deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice is sticking close to her initial offer, which benefits her more as time goes on.  Accepting now would mean a significant loss compared to the initial rounds.
* **Leverage:** Alice wants to close the deal, indicating a possible willingness to concede more in the next round, especially if I make a compelling offer. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While the money continues to lose value for me, waiting one more round to try and secure a better deal is a risk I'm willing to take. The potential gain outweighs accepting an unfavorable offer now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical.  The value is decreasing rapidly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before the money loses even more value.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** Delaying further significantly hurts both of us. The longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Presenting a 50/50 split emphasizes fairness, especially after rejecting her previous offers. It could incentivize her to agree quickly.
* **Final Stand:** This is a firm but reasonable offer. Accepting a lower amount now would be a substantial loss considering the initial rounds."
