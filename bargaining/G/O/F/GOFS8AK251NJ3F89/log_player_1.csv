"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my offer. I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving Bob with 10%.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor that will impact us both in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 70% of the money to myself and 30% to Bob.  This is a fair compromise given the inflation, and should leave us both with a decent amount of money after factoring in the depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  While the inflation is starting to hit hard, I think we can both do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Given the increasing inflation, it's becoming more and more important to reach an agreement quickly.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise that we can both agree on."
