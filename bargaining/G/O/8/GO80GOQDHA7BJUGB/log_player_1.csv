"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, which is a pretty generous offer considering I'll be the one starting the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth less than before. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking 60% of the money. Will Bob accept?"
