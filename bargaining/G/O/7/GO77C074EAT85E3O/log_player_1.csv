"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting this is a fair split for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal, considering the initial split I proposed was 60-40 in my favor. The impact of inflation on my potential gain makes me more cautious, but I'm willing to proceed to the next round in hopes of securing a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve the larger share.""}\n\n###\n\nI've adjusted my offer slightly, taking into account the devaluation of the money due to inflation, but still aiming for a favorable split. My message to Bob emphasizes my willingness to compromise while asserting my belief in deserving the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous, Alice. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains even more. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, with a devaluation of 48.8% from the first round, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer. The difference in our proposed splits is now relatively small, and further rounds would only continue to erode the value of the money I could gain. Accepting this offer seems prudent to avoid losing even more value to inflation."
