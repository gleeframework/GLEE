"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to make the most of this money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable and willing to compromise."
