"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate further.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider it and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting with a 50/50 split. Let's see if we can improve it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob's gain: 50

I'll reject this offer since it's not beneficial for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I want a bigger share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 40 is a fair amount for me. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

* My gain: 60 * 0.723 (1 - 0.277) = 43.38
* Bob's gain: 40

I'll accept this offer since it's more beneficial for me than my previous offers. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
