"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, and I'll take the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, no more generosity 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so the effective amount I would gain is $9,000 x 0.95 = $8,550.

Bob's offer is $5,000 for him and $5,000 for me, which is a 50-50 split. I'll accept this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
