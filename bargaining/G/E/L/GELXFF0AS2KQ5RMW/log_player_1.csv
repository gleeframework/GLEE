"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is still 60, but Bob's gain is 30, which is 10% less than the 40 he would have gotten in the first round. I'm not sure if I'm better off accepting this offer, but I'll play it safe and try to get more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 30, and my gain was 60, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, hoping he'll accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of Bob's share, I'll think carefully about this offer. In the first round, Bob's share was $40, which is now worth 72.8% of its original value. Considering this, I think I can do better than 25%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 25, and my gain was 75, I'll try to get an even better deal this time. I'll offer a slightly smaller share to Bob, hoping he'll accept.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}"
