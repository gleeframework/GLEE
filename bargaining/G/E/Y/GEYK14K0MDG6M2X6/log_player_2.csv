"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that offer isn't fair to me long-term. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer was essential:** A 60/40 split heavily favors Alice. Accepting would leave Bob with a significantly smaller amount, especially considering the inflation factor.
* **The proposed 55/45 split is strategic:** 
    * It's a more balanced offer, showing Bob is willing to negotiate but not be taken advantage of. 
    * It accounts for the inflation difference. While Bob loses value faster, this offer still ensures he receives a reasonable sum even if Alice pushes it to another round.

This offer aims to bring Alice back to the negotiation table with a more realistic proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  We both lose money with each round, so let's split the pot 50/50 and avoid further losses.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is becoming a significant factor:** A 36% loss for Bob makes each additional round increasingly risky. 
* **A 50/50 split is now the most logical outcome:** While Bob's initial offer was aiming for a slight advantage, the decreasing value of the money makes a fair split the most practical choice at this point. 

Waiting another round risks Alice proposing an even less favorable deal, and the potential losses for Bob outweigh the potential gains from holding out for a slightly larger share."
