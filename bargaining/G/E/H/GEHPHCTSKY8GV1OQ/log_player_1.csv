"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair that we both get a little more this round. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60-40 split this round. I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the split this round. Can we try 55-45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll!

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split this round.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my guns on the 55-45 split, but adjusting the numbers to account for the decreased value of money."
