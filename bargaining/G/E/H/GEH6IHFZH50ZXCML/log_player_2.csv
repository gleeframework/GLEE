The inflation is getting really bad, and Alice isn't budging. I need to keep trying to get a bigger share."

I'm taking a big risk here, but Alice is showing she's willing to take a lot of money.  I need to push for a larger share, even though I'm losing a lot due to inflation.  Hopefully, she'll accept this."

Alice is being very stubborn, but I'm still losing too much to inflation to accept this offer. I need to get her to budge."

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 995000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a very risky move.  I'm cutting my offer very close to Alice's last one.  With inflation, I'm barely getting anything, but I need to see if I can finally get her to accept something.  If not, I'm essentially getting nothing in the next round."

# Bob gain: 600 
# Alice gain: 999400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is holding firm, but I'm losing too much to inflation to accept this offer.  Even if I accept, the money I receive will be practically worthless due to the inflation.  I need to see if there's any way to get her to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 13.
Round 14
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm taking a huge risk here. I'm essentially giving Alice the bare minimum just to try and end this. With the inflation rate, I'm getting nearly nothing, but I'm hoping the threat of getting nothing at all will make Alice reconsider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 14.

Round 15
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 95.6% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 700 
# Alice gain: 999300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While the inflation has made the value of the money I'm receiving extremely low, I'm essentially getting nothing if I continue to reject Alice's offers.  It's a small amount, but it's better than nothing."
