I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 and Bob getting 40.  This feels like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates will be different for each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to slightly adjust my offer to 55/45.  This accounts for the inflation, but still acknowledges that I'm willing to compromise."
