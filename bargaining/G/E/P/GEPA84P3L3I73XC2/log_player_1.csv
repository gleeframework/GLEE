"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering 60% of the initial $100 to myself, which is $60, and 40% to Bob, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It looks like we're splitting the money 50/50, which is a fair deal given the circumstances."
