I'm going to propose a split of $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob.  This feels like a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a factor.  6000 is significantly less than 9000, but it's still a decent chunk of money. Since the money I gain is worth less than it was in the first round, I'm better off taking this offer than risking another round and getting an even lower amount."
