"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 900,000 - 100,000 split.  I think this is fair as it gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me, and while the money is worth less, the reduction in value is still more significant for me. I'll reject and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing a 800,000 - 200,000 split.  I'm reducing my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but still leaving Bob with a considerable amount.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, I'm still not willing to accept this offer.  Bob's offer is still significantly less favorable to me than my last proposal. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 700,000 - 300,000 split. I'm continuing to adjust my offer to account for inflation, but I'm still trying to secure a fair share for myself.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, this is the best offer I've received so far.  I'm accepting this offer to avoid further losses from inflation."
