Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a seemingly generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept and we can both get something. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and with inflation, my share is worth less than it would have been in the first round. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all, so I'll accept."
