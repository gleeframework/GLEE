"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to take it, since we both get more money if we end the game now.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take what I can get, I believe that I can still get a better deal if I play strategically. Since the money depreciates with each round, I'm hoping I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. He rejected my last offer, so I'm not going to be as generous this time around.  Hopefully, he'll see that accepting this offer is better than risking the money becoming worth even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  The money is depreciating quickly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round.  While I would have preferred a larger share, I have to accept that my negotiating power is diminishing with each round. It's better to take something than nothing."
