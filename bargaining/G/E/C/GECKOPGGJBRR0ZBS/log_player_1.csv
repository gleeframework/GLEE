"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take 90% and leave Bob with 10%. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer. While I will lose money if I reject, I am confident that I can get a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'll lower my offer to 70% for me, and 30% for Bob. This should be a fair compromise, as I'm willing to concede some of my gains from the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though the value of the money is decreasing, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal for myself. I'm willing to risk the loss of value for the chance to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll offer a 60/40 split in my favor. I've lowered my expectations further, but I still believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances and the risk of further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. Even though the money is worth less now, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. The risk of getting nothing is high, but I'm not willing to accept such an unfair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise considering the high risk of getting nothing at all if we continue to reject each other's offers."
