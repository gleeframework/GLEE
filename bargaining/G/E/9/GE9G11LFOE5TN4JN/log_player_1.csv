I'm going to offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself. It's a high initial offer, but I think it's important to show that I'm willing to be fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer. It's unfair, and I'm willing to risk going another round to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. This is a more balanced offer than my previous one, and I think it's a good starting point for a compromise."
