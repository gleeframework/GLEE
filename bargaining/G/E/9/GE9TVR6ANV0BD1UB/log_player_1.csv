"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm not rejecting it outright either. I'm leaving the door open for a potential counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to give you an equal share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even division of the remaining $10,000."
