"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $100,000, which is equivalent to $80,000 in the first round. I want to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another tough decision!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 48.8% compared to the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In the first round, $300,000 was a relatively small share, but now it's a slightly larger share in terms of the reduced value.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $300,000, as it's still a relatively small share, even considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation continuing to reduce the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing purchasing power. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully about the value of the money in the current round. $450,000 is a slightly larger share than before, but it's still a significant reduction from the original $800,000 I was offered in the first round.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $450,000, as it's a slightly better deal than what I've been offered before, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that may not come."
