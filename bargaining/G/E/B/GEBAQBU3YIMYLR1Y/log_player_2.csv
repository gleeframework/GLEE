"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you get 40.  We can adjust as we go along. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the inflation impacts Alice's offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""That's a tough start, Alice. How about we try something closer to the middle?  Time is running out, and the value is decreasing quickly, especially for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise. Let's split it 50/50. We both lose value if we keep going. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation. Accepting ensures we both get something!"
