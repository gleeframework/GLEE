Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going to split it evenly, I've been patient enough 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging. While getting only $43 isn't ideal, it's still better than getting $0 if we run out of rounds.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a better deal, but I also need to be mindful that time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to emphasize that time is running out and we risk getting nothing.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering $47 is a slight increase from my previous $45 offer, signaling I'm willing to compromise slightly.
* **Firmness:**  The ""take it or leave it"" language conveys that I'm serious and won't be endlessly negotiating. 

This is a risky move as Alice might call my bluff. However, it might be enough to get her to accept a deal that's still in her favor, but better than what I've been offered so far."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not impressed. This is my new proposal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but time is now critically short.  Accepting $44 is significantly less than I wanted, but:

* **Inflation:**  Waiting any longer means the offer will be worth even less.  Another round means a loss of nearly 10% on top of what I'm already losing.
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better. She might even offer less in the next round, putting me in a worse position.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts my losses and ensures I at least get something."
