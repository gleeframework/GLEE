"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try the opposite, I start with the advantage this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation is hurting me, not you. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier and the inflation hasn't hit him *that* hard yet. We need to push him towards a more equitable split. He's likely hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take an even bigger share, inflation is really eating into my potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous, but Bob is getting outrageously greedy. He's clearly trying to exploit the inflation difference. I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  He'll be hurt more than me if this fails."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5050,
""bob_gain"": 4950,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm making one last attempt at a reasonable compromise. This offer is as close to even as it's going to get, given the circumstances. Accept it, or let's both walk away empty-handed. The clock is ticking.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to lay down the law. I'm making a very slight concession, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but also making it clear this is my final offer.  The strong language emphasizes the urgency and the potential for mutual loss. Bob is running out of time to be greedy."
