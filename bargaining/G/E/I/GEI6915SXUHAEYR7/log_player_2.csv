"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's a good deal for you in early rounds because of the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided deal. Let's see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation.  It's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Let's be realistic, the inflation hurts you more than me. Take this deal or I'll aim for even higher. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being aggressive, but I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me.  There are still several rounds left, and the inflation is going to make her offer increasingly less attractive to me.  I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 35/65.  Let's meet in the middle at 45/55. This way, we can both benefit from the remaining rounds.""}
