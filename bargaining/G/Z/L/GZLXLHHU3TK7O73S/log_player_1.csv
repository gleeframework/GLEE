"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, with the message that I'm trying to start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that $60 is a large enough share for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30, with the message that I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and protecting my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth significantly less, and I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer to split it 50/50 seems reasonable, especially since we're getting closer to the end of the game.

I'll accept Bob's offer for round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think splitting it 50/50 is a fair deal, and it's better than risking going into further rounds with decreasing returns."
