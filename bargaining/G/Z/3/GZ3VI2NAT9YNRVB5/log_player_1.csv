"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more this time, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see how this works out for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll take into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, but still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
