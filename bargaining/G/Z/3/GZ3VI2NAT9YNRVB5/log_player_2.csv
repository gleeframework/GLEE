"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. While it seems fair now, I want to see if I can get a better deal considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see how this works out for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, but still willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, I'm concerned about further inflation eroding my share. Accepting this offer ensures I receive something, and the possibility of further negotiation is still there."
