"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, considering the inflation.  I'd rather get 50% now than risk getting nothing later."
