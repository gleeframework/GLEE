"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's share!

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting an even worse deal due to further inflation."
