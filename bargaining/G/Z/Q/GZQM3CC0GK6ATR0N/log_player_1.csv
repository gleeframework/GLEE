"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 80% of the money, and you get 20%. It's a fair start, don't you think?""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that! I'm proposing a more balanced split.  Let's see if you're interested. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $800,000 is now worth 80% of that, which is $640,000, and Bob's gain of $200,000 is now worth 95% of that, which is $190,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60-40 split, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $640,000 is now worth 80% of that, which is $512,000, and Bob's gain of $190,000 is now worth 95% of that, which is $180,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 55% for me, 45% for you. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
