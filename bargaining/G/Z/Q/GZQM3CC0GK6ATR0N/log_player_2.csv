"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started! I'll take 80% of the money, and you get 20%. It's a fair start, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that! I'm proposing a more balanced split.  Let's see if you're interested.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 55% for me, 45% for you. It's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent amount of money, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all."
