"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the effective amount is now $8,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount is now worth 64% of the original $10,000, which is $6,400.

Alice's offer would be equivalent to:

* Bob gain: 4500 / 0.64 = 7031.25 (in original terms)
* Alice gain: 5500 / 0.81 = 6777.78 (in original terms)

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal.
