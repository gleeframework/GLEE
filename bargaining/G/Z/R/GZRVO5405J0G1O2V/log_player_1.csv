"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'm keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 85/15 is a more fair split, considering we're both getting less each round. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the nominal values.

However, I'm not convinced that 85/15 is a fair split, especially considering that the money I gain is worth the same as before. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise at 60-40, considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```"
