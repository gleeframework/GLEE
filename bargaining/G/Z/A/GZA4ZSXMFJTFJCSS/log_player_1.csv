"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as it's a decent starting point, and there's still plenty of time to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic negotiation tactic. Bob is trying to flip the script and take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 80/20, but I'm still holding strong. I think Bob will realize that he needs to compromise to get anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to play games, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  I'm not going to let him bully me into accepting such a lopsided deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to 70/30.  Bob's offers are getting worse, but I need to be realistic about the inflation.  Hopefully, this shows him I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still stuck in a pattern of trying to reverse the negotiation, and I'm not going to let him control the pace.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 60/40. The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to secure something before we run out of time. Hopefully, Bob will realize that he needs to compromise to get anything at all."
