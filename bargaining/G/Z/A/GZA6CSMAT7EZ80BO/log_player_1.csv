"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's agree!""}\n\nI'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40. I think this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to end the game quickly. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more for me! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI don't think Bob's offer is fair, especially considering the inflation. I was willing to give him $40 in the first round, but now he's asking for $55, which is worth 20% less than before. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal!""}\n\nI'm taking into account the inflation that has occurred so far. Since the money is worth less to both of us now, I'm willing to offer Bob a bit more than I would have in the first round. However, I still think I deserve the larger share, so I'll propose $58 for myself and $42 for Bob. Let's see if he agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation hurts me more, I need a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI understand that inflation is affecting Bob more, but I still don't think his offer is fair. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I want to maximize my share. Since Bob is more affected by inflation, I believe he will be more willing to compromise as the rounds go on. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both, let's settle!""}\n\nI'm taking into account the increasing effect of inflation on both of us. Since the money is worth significantly less to Bob now, I think he should be more willing to accept a slightly smaller share. I'll propose $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, hoping that he'll see the sense in settling soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, it's getting desperate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant effect of inflation on the value of the money, I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise. At this point, getting $50 is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game here."
