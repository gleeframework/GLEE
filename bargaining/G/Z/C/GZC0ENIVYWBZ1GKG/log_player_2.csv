"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take this deal and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. 60-40 doesn't seem like a fair split to me. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try 55-45. It's more fair than your offer!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think it's time to stop the game. With the money losing value each round, it's not worth risking another round. Splitting it evenly seems like a fair deal at this point, and I don't want to lose out on more value. Let's end it here!"
