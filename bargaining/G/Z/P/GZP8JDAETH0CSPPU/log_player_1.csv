"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $270,000. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $700,000 remains the same.

I'll decide to reject this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is 0.38, which is not favorable to me. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this time, hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

After three rounds, my gain of $450,000 from round 3 is now worth only 72.9% of its original value, which is equivalent to $326,550. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $650,000 remains the same.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is 0.538, which is still not favorable to me.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 72.9% of its original value after four rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this time, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
