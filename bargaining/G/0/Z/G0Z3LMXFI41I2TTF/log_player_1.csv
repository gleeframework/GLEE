"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so the effective amount I gain is 40 * 0.8 = 32.

I'm not sure I agree that Bob deserves more for his negotiating skills, especially since I'm the one who made the initial offer and he's the one who rejected it. However, I'm willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
