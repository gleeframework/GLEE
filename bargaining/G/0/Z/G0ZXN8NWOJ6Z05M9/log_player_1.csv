"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it will incentivize him to accept in the first round, avoiding potential inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it seems like a fair split, it is significantly less than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially considering the potential for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I am offering Bob 200,000$ and keeping 800,000$ for myself. I believe this is a fair compromise, as I am willing to decrease my share from the previous round, while still ensuring a significant portion of the total money.  This should incentivize Bob to accept before the potential for further inflation takes its toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I understand the game is becoming more difficult with each round, this offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal and even lower than the previous offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a share so much lower than what I believe is fair.  I hope Bob understands the risks of continuing this game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I am offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself.  This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the increasing inflation while still securing a large portion of the money.  I believe it's in both of our best interests to end the game before the situation worsens further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is unacceptable. Even with the potential for inflation, I cannot accept a share that is so significantly lower than my initial offer. I am willing to negotiate a fair compromise, but this offer is simply not reasonable. I will continue to fight for a more equitable split, as the risk of further inflation is significant."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I am offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This offer is a significant compromise, considering the ongoing inflation and the fact that Bob has rejected all my previous proposals. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, given the current circumstances.  It's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement before the potential for even greater losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is unacceptable.  I am unwilling to accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially considering the potential for further inflation.  I still believe a fair compromise is possible, and I will continue to negotiate for a more equitable split. The game is getting increasingly risky with each round, and I am not willing to settle for a deal that is so unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I am offering a 50/50 split. Given the continuous rejections and the risk of further inflation, I believe this is the fairest solution. It acknowledges the need for compromise and ensures that both of us receive a significant portion of the remaining funds."
