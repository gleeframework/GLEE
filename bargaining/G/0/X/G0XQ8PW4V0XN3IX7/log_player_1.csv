"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth even less in value. Here's my next offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still holding back a bit, hoping Bob will accept this offer."

}
```"
