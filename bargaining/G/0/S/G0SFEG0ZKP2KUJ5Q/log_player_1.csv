"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think this is a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to set a precedent for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round, so it's actually worth $4,500 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, especially since he's getting a slightly better deal due to the lower inflation rate. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up control.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me too little, I want more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if giving Bob a larger share is a good idea. However, I don't want to risk him rejecting my next offer, so I'll accept this one.
