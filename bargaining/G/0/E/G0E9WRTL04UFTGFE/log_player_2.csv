"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start this off right. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer for me in the first round, but it leaves you with a decent sum. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better for both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial share, but it also reflects the value of my time and effort. Let's work together to get the most out of this deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time and both benefit from this.  I propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair, simple, and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
