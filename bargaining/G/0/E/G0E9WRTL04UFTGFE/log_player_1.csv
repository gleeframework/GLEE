"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better for both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial share, but it also reflects the value of my time and effort. Let's work together to get the most out of this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
