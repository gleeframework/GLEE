"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% if you take this deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to consider that when making my decision. In this case, I'd be getting $400,000, which is equivalent to $500,000 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but it's a decent offer considering the inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
