"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this 100k and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only the first round, and I'm not willing to settle for just 10% of the total amount. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical.  We're both losing money with each round.  This is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not convinced by Alice's argument. The inflation does reduce the value of the money for me, but accepting this offer would still mean I'm getting a relatively small share of the total amount. I'll wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous. This is a good compromise.""}"
