"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, keeping 99% of the money for myself and giving Bob a small portion. This is to encourage him to accept, knowing he'll likely get a worse deal if he rejects and we go to the next round. I'm also accounting for the inflation, hoping Bob will appreciate the value of the offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate and 500,000 is a good deal considering the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and further rounds might lead to a worse outcome due to inflation."
