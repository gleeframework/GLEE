Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be fairer to each other. This offer reflects the fact that the money is devaluing faster for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""message"": ""This is still not a fair deal, Bob. You're benefiting more from the inflation difference. I'm willing to negotiate, but this isn't it.""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and the money is losing value with every passing moment. This offer is a good compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I'll accept this offer. Let's not risk losing more value."" 
}
``` 
 
Even though the deal is still slightly in Bob's favor, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the money loses value.  The longer Alice waits for a better offer, the less favorable even a slightly better split will become. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a significantly better offer in Round 5 is risky. There's no guarantee Bob will propose something more appealing, and both players will continue to lose money due to inflation.

By accepting now, Alice secures a reasonable amount, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
