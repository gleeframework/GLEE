Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with Bob taking 60% of the total amount. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
