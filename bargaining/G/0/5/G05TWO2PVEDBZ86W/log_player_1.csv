"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer is a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, as the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the previous one, it is still not in my best interest. I am hoping to secure a larger share of the money, and this offer is still too low considering the inflation factor.  I believe I can get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I am offering a 70/30 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I am decreasing my proposed share slightly, but I believe this is still a fair offer considering the inflation.  I am hoping that Bob will realize that he needs to accept a deal soon, as the value of the money will continue to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal. The inflation is starting to have a bigger impact, but I believe the next few rounds will give me a chance to secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is still favorable for me but shows a willingness to compromise. The inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, and I believe Bob is starting to feel the pressure. This offer should be appealing enough for him to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and I am still determined to secure a better deal. Despite the significant inflation, I believe I can still get a more favorable outcome in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm willing to go for a 50/50 split in this round. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a significant portion of the remaining value. It is a risky move, but I believe it's necessary to avoid getting a worse deal in the next round."
