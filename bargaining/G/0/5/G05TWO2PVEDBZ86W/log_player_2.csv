It's very early in the game, and Alice's offer is very unfair. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it will be in Alice's best interest to accept."

Alice's offer is still not fair, even with the inflation. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'm increasing my share slightly to 70%, but still offering Alice a decent amount. Inflation is starting to take effect, and I need to secure a bigger portion of the money before it's worth even less."

Alice's offer is still too low, considering the inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

Inflation is really biting now, so I'm pushing for a bigger share. This is a very risky move, but I need to secure more money while I can."

With inflation eating away at our potential gains, this 50/50 split is the best I can realistically hope for.  It's time to take what I can get."
