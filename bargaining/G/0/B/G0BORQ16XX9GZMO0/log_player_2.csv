Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats away even more of your share. This is your last chance for a somewhat fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option.  It's better to get something than nothing at this point."
