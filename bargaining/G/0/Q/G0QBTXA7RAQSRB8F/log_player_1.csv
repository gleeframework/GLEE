"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $1,000 and keep $9,000.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. My gain of $2,000 in this round is actually worth only $1,600 (80% of $2,000).

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the offer. I'll propose a new deal: I'll take $4,000 and you can have $6,000.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take $6,000 and I'll keep $4,000.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive with this offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! In Round 4, the money is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1, so my gain of $5,000 is actually worth only $2,600 (51.2% of $5,000).

I'm not thrilled with the idea of a 50/50 split, but I'm also not eager to continue negotiating. I'll consider this offer. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, let's split it 50/50. But I'm not happy about it.""
}
```"
