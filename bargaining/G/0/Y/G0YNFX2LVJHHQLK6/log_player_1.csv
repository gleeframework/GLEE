Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share before inflation starts to eat away at our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is making it hard to agree on an even split. I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but it's still better than the previous offer and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is heavily in my favor. While his offer is better than the previous round, it's still heavily skewed in his favor when considering the real value of the money due to inflation. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The inflation is working against you, not me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer, which is more than fair considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it - time is running out for you.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but he's still being stubborn. It's time to play hardball. I'm reiterating my first offer and making it clear that I'm not budging much. This puts the pressure on Bob to accept a less favorable deal before inflation eats away at his potential gains even further."
