# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is more generous than her first, the inflation is hurting me significantly. I'm still going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
