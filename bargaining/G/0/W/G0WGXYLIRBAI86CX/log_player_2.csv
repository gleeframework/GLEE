"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bit risky to accept such a lopsided offer so early in the game. There's a chance I can get a better deal later, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share before the inflation kicks in.""}
