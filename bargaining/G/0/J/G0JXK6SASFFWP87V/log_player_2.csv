"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, but time is money. Take this offer and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can negotiate a better split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. We both get an equal share, and we can walk away happy!""}"
