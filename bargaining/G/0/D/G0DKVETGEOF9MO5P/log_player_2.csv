"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. Let me know if you agree. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $2500 is a decent starting point, it's very likely that Alice is going to propose a more favorable split for herself in the next round. By rejecting, Bob forces Alice to make the next proposal, potentially leading to a better deal for him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds.""}
