"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, my gain of 300,000 is equivalent to 240,000 in the original amount, and Bob's gain of 700,000 is still 700,000.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather have more money in the original amount. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my evaluation of the offer.

In this case, my gain of 450,000 is equivalent to 230,400 in the original amount, and Bob's gain of 550,000 is still 550,000.

I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal than my previous offers, considering the effects of inflation.
