"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of the original value.

For me, the offer is 40 / 0.8 = 50, and for Bob, it's 60 / 0.8 = 75.

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting less than I proposed in the first round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% of 100%), I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 32, ""bob_gain"": 68}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gains considering the inflation.

For me, the offer is 30 / 0.516 (1 - 0.488) = 58.17, and for Bob, it's 70 / 0.516 = 135.78.

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting less than I proposed in the previous round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value now (52% of 48.8% of 80% of 100%), I'll make a new proposal.
