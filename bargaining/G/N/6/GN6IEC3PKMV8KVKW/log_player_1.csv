"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:\n\n

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I am offering to take $6000 and give Bob $4000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Let me know if Bob accepts or rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I understand you want a larger share, but consider the inflation. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth less now, but I still think I should get a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. The value is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money, and Bob's offer is reasonable at this point. I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round and losing even more value."
