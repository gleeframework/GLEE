700000.0,300000.0,Let's divide the money fairly. I propose you receive 300000$ and I take 700000$. We can adjust our shares in future rounds if needed.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"You're being too generous, let's try for a bigger share for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I think a fair division would be 600000$ for me and 400000$ for you. This maintains a reasonable balance while also considering the inflation impact on our future rounds.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm still not satisfied with the share. I think I deserve more, considering the risk of inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I believe a 50/50 split is fair under these circumstances. It ensures both of us receive an equal share while also accounting for potential inflation impacts in future rounds.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'm taking a firmer stance. I think I deserve a larger share, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the inflation and our previous offers, I suggest a 400000$ for me and 600000$ for you. This maintains a balanced approach while reflecting the reduced value of money in each subsequent round.",Alice,7,
