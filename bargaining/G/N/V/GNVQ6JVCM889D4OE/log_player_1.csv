"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the initial amount.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'll take a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000

I'll reject this offer. The split is too even, I'd like to negotiate for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less than the original, so the amounts are:

* Original $10,000 * 0.516 = $5,160 (this is the new base value)
* Alice gain: 5200 / 5.16 ≈ 1007
* Bob gain: 4800 / 5.16 ≈ 929

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise considering the inflation.
