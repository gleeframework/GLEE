I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6000 and Bob $4000. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation rates, as my money loses value slower.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is proposing a 40/60 split in his favor, which is worse than my initial offer, even considering the inflation. I'll reject this and see if we can come to a more reasonable agreement in the next round."

I'm offering a 54/46 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation, as my money is worth 10% less than the previous round.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering we've both rejected offers in the previous rounds. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
