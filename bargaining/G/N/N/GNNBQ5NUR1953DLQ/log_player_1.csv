"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose taking 999,000 for myself and giving Bob 1,000. This is a very unequal split, but I'm trying to maximize my gains in the first round, knowing the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer to take more, this is a much fairer offer than the previous one, and accepting it guarantees me half of the money. Since Bob is taking a significant hit from inflation in future rounds, it's unlikely he will offer more."
