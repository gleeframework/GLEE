42.0,58.0,"Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I think it's only fair that I get a slightly larger share. 58-42 seems reasonable to me.",Bob,4,

54.0,46.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the value keeps dropping. I'm willing to compromise further, but this needs to be reasonable.  I propose $54 for me and $46 for you.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"With inflation hitting you harder each round, I think it's time for me to take a firmer stance. 60-40 is my new proposal. The longer we wait, the less your share will be worth.",Bob,6,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now.  Take it before inflation eats away at the value even more!",Alice,7,
