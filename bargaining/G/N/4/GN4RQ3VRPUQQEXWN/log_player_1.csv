"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it's a bit more for me since I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair split, and it's better to accept now than risk getting less in the next round."
