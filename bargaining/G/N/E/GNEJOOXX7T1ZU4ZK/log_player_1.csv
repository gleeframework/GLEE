I propose to take $9000 and leave Bob with $1000. It's a generous offer considering I'm the one making the proposal, but I want to establish a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. This should show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also aware that the money is losing value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
