# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round. With the current offer, I'd get $40, but I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting us both, Bob. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although inflation is affecting both of us, Alice is losing more value each round. Given that we have more rounds to go, I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. Let's see what the next round brings!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I think this is a reasonable adjustment. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth, especially for you, Alice.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both aiming for a good deal. Let's split it evenly and call it a day before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, splitting the money evenly seems like a fair compromise at this point. The longer we negotiate, the less value the money will have for both of us, but especially for Alice. This seems like a reasonable deal to conclude the game.
