"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. My message to Bob is that I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, considering the inflation will impact me more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I think Bob's offer is a good one. The 45-55 split seems more even, and I appreciate his consideration of the inflation impact on him.
