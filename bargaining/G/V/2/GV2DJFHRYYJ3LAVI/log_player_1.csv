"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, Alice. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new proposal, I'll consider the inflation effect. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll effectively get 80% of 90% of the original $100, which is $72.

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping for a higher share, considering the initial offer I made was 80% and I'm now getting only 72% of the reduced value. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, which means I'll effectively get 72% of 90% of the original $100, which is 64.8$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```"
