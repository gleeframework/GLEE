"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to get the game started!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll take a smaller share this round 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, and Bob is trying to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll try to make a stronger offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the 60-40 split Bob offered last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is still trying to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because the 65-35 split is still not favorable to me. I'm hoping Bob will make a better offer in the next round, considering the money is worth even less now."

Round 5

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a better deal""

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up yet 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and Bob is still trying to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because the 68-32 split is the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds where the money will be worth even less. I'm hoping Bob will keep his word and we can finalize the deal."
