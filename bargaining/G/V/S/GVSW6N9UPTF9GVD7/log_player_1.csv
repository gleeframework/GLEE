"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4,000 for you is a bit low. I'm offering 6,000 for myself and 4,000 for you, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
