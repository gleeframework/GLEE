"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point and Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, you can't beat this offer! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 2000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is still a significant amount.

However, Bob's gain of 8000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is a much larger share.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll try to think strategically. If I reject this offer, I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but if I accept, I'll get a decent amount of money.

I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gain, making it worth only 41.6% of what it was in the first round (80% of 64% = 51.2%, then 51.2% of 80% = 40.96%, but I'll round down to 48.8% for simplicity).

However, I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer. His gain is worth 75.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%, then 72.9% of 96.2% = 70.1%, but I'll round up to 75.2% for simplicity), which is a significant amount.

I'm not sure if I should push for a better deal or accept this offer. Considering the inflation, I might not be able to get a better deal in the next round.

I'll decide to...
