{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable, you're losing more to inflation than I am. How about a 55/45 split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, but I'm the one taking on more risk with the inflation.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about taking on more risk, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal, especially as the inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better for you.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Two rejections each means we're approaching the halfway point. The 50/50 split is the fairest offer, and making it clear this is my final offer might push Alice to accept before the inflation eats away at the value even further."
