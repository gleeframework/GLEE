"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to think about whether 400,000 is enough for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed towards me, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm trying to be generous to make a deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, $300,000 is a relatively smaller amount than I was hoping for.

However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round, as the value of the money will only continue to decrease. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
