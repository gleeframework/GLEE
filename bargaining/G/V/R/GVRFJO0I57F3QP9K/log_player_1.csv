"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reverse it - I'll take 60, you take 40.  A fair deal, I think! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll think about it for a moment... With the inflation, my 40 dollars is now worth less than before, but I still don't want to give up more than I have to. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and offer a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
