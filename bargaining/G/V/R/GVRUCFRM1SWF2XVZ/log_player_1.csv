"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. The message is a bit of a hint that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to give up much at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're willing to compromise, but I'll try to be generous 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $70 is now worth 0.9 \* $70 = $63.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $20, which is worth 0.9 \* $20 = $18 after inflation.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's better than nothing. I'll take the $18 and end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
