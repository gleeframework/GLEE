Round 5

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is hurting my share more. However, she is using this to her advantage and proposing increasingly worse deals.  I need to hold firm and demonstrate I'm willing to risk it all, otherwise, she'll keep pushing me closer to her terms."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a simple even split to end this now. Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better for you.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power play.  A firm, even split offer emphasizes that I'm aware of the situation and unwilling to accept her increasingly unfair proposals. The ""take it or leave it"" language adds weight and finality, hoping to push her towards accepting a fair deal before inflation eats away at the value."
