"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is too bad, considering I was initially looking for a 60-40 split. Meeting in the middle at 50-50 isn't a bad compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
