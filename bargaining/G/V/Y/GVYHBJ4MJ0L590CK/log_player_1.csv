"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my proposed gain of $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's proposed gain of $8,000 is worth 80% of its original value.

I'm not convinced that this is a fair compromise, considering the significant difference in the values of our gains. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer. I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more due to the initial offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer and the reduced value of the money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my proposed gain of $3,000 is now worth 73.9% of its original value, and Bob's proposed gain of $7,000 is now worth 56% of its original value.

I'm not convinced that this offer is a significant enough compromise, given the reduced value of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer.
