"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer
To start the game, I need to make an initial offer to Bob. Considering the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases by 10% for me (Alice) and by 5% for Bob with each passing round, my strategy should aim at maximizing my gain while considering the decreasing value of money.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer
Given the total amount is $100, a reasonable first offer could slightly favor me, as I am the one making the proposal, but it also needs to be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting it, taking into account the future decrease in value. A common approach in negotiation games like this is to start with a somewhat favorable but not overly biased offer.

### Step 3: Formulate the message
The message should be concise and explain the reasoning behind the offer. Since this is the first round, the message can be straightforward, focusing on the fairness of the offer and the benefit of accepting early due to the decreasing value of money.

### Step 4: Finalize the offer and message
Given the considerations above, I decide to offer myself $55 and Bob $45. This slightly favors me but is close enough to a 50/50 split to be considered somewhat fair, especially given the pressure of future rounds decreasing the money's value more significantly for me.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Fair start considering future value decrease.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical. This round ensures a better outcome for me than your previous offer would next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer
Bob has offered me $45, which, due to inflation, is worth 10% less than in the first round. This means the actual value I would receive is $45 * 0.9 = $40.50. Bob would receive $55, which is worth 5% less, making it $55 * 0.95 = $52.25.

### Step 2: Compare with potential future outcomes
If I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the money's value will decrease further. However, I must consider whether I can propose a division that would be more favorable to me after another round of inflation. Given the rates of inflation, my goal is to minimize loss while trying to achieve a fair or better outcome.

### Step 3: Consider the strategic implications
Accepting this offer means I would be agreeing to a division that slightly favors Bob, but it also means avoiding further loss due to inflation. Rejecting the offer would allow me to make another proposal but with the risk of Bob rejecting it and the value of money decreasing further.

### Step 4: Make a decision
Given the decreasing value of money and the offer on the table, accepting Bob's offer might be the most practical decision to ensure I receive a tangible amount rather than risking further devaluation. While it's not the most favorable outcome for me, it's reasonable considering the game's progression and the impact of inflation.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
