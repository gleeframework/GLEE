Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, let's close the deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** With each round, Alice's share is losing value significantly faster than mine. This makes her more likely to accept a deal with a smaller percentage, as waiting means potentially getting even less.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. If I reject this and don't reach a deal soon, we risk getting nothing at all.
* **Better Than Future Rounds:** It's unlikely Alice will offer a better deal in the remaining rounds. She's likely to decrease her offer further, hoping I'll cave under the pressure of time and inflation.

Accepting now secures me a reasonable sum, even if it's less than what I aimed for initially."
