"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring me slightly.  This gives Bob a small share to incentivize acceptance, while still securing a majority for myself.  We both get a good chunk of money, and it sets a fair baseline for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is a complete reversal of the first round. While it might have been tempting initially, I'm confident that we can achieve a more equitable outcome.  Rejecting allows me to propose in the next round and demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still advocating for a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  However, it still ensures a majority for me while offering Bob a fair share.  I believe this proposal reflects the changing value of the money and encourages a quicker resolution."
