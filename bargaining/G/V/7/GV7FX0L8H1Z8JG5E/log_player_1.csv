"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose to keep the majority of the money (999,000) and give Bob a small amount (1,000). I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round, as the inflation will significantly affect my earnings in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation will significantly decrease my earnings in the future. Accepting the offer will guarantee me 500,000, and given the inflation, rejecting it may lead to a worse outcome."
