Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening offer. Since inflation impacts us differently, I want to secure as much as possible early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal, even considering the inflation. I'm going to reject and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm going to lower my demands slightly, but still try to secure a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as the inflation will only continue to devalue the money further in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call. I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, and Bob's offer is less than ideal. However, I'm not sure I can secure a better deal in the next round. If I reject this, I risk getting a worse offer in the next round, and the inflation will continue to hurt me. It's time to cut my losses and accept this offer."
