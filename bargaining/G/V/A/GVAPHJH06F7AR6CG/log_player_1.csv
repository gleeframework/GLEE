  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're offering 60% and I'm offering 40. It's a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to be fair, but I think I can do better. With inflation, my 300,000$ is worth even less than before, and I'd rather not settle for that.

```
