"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll make sure to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9).

Bob's offer is to split it 50/50, which means I would get $4,500 (5000 * 0.9) and Bob would get $4,500.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
