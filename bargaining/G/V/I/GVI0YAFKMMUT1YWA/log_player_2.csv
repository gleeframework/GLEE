"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though it's a ""fair"" split, I'm going to reject this offer. The game mechanic means that the value of the money will decrease with each round, so I want to see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a better split for both of us. We both get more than we would with your offer, and it's closer to a 50/50 split. Let's end it here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This offer is better for me than my previous proposal, and while the money is worth less due to inflation, I don't want to risk further losses. Let's end the game."
