Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 45% is still a fair split considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
