"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can just split the money fairly and avoid any further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the numbers are:

Alice's gain: 450,000 x 0.8 = 360,000
Bob's gain: 550,000 x 0.8 = 440,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
