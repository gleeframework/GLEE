"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on my side, I can wait 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, accepting means I lose a significant amount compared to my original offer. It's risky, but I'm hoping Bob will become more reasonable as the game progresses, especially as my potential offers will shrink further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now.  The longer this goes on, the less we both get!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time for a drastic shift in strategy. Bob is clearly willing to drag this out, but I need to make him see the bigger picture. A 50/50 split might seem generous at this point, but it's the best way to ensure I get a reasonable amount before inflation eats away at the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers 
# Alice gain: 390000 
# Bob gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is being incredibly stubborn, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. While 390,000 is significantly less than I wanted, it's better than what I'd get in the next round if Bob continues this pattern. Holding out any longer is too risky."
