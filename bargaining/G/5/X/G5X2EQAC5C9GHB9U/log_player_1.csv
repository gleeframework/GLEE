I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I want to make sure we both get something.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I think it's smart to accept this offer.  Bob is taking a larger share, but the inflation means that my $1,000 is still worth the same as it was in the first round.  It's better to take something now than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
