Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but I need to hold my ground a little longer. While the inflation is hurting, accepting an offer below a 40/60 split in my favor at this stage is likely worse than risking further negotiation.  There's still a chance Alice will fold in a later round to avoid getting nothing."
