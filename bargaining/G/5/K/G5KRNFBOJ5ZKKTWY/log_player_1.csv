"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split, let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed a reasonable one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement!"
