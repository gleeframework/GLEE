"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 70:30 ratio. This might not seem fair, but consider the inflation factor. In the next round, the value of money decreases by 10%. If we don't agree now, the situation will only get worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

I'm willing to compromise, but I believe this split is fairer considering the declining value of the money for both of us.""}
