"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected the offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer. Here's my proposal for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get 50$, and we can negotiate further if we want."
