"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the smaller share to start""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take the smaller share, leaving Bob with a larger share, in an attempt to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, the actual amount I'd gain from Bob's offer is $45 (50 x 0.9).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. It's a fair split, but I'm not sure if I should wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2 for me, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up much""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round for me, so I'll calculate my actual gain:

$45 x 0.723 (1 - 0.277) = $32.53

This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I could try to negotiate for a better share, but it's getting late in the game.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round for me, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the smaller share this time, let's see if you'll take it""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a smaller share to myself, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can end the game."
