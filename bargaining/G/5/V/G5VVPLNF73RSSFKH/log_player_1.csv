"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward proposal to split the money evenly, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the 400k I'd get is actually worth 380k in real terms. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now and see if I can do better.
