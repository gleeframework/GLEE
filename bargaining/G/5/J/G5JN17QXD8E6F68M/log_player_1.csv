"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message ""Let's be fair"". This is a reasonable starting point, considering we both want a share of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to start with a fairly even split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! This offer is a little better for me, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob $5500 and me only $4500. Considering the inflation, this offer is indeed better for Bob, but it's not good enough for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself. Given that the money is now worth 40% less for me due to inflation (20% decrease in each of the two rounds), I'm willing to be slightly more aggressive in my proposal to try to reach a deal. I'll point out in the message that considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both of us, in the hopes that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I can make a decent offer considering the inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less than the initial value), I think this offer is reasonable. Bob's message also implies that this is the last round where he's willing to make a decent offer, so I don't want to risk going into another round where the inflation could make the money even less valuable. I'll take the $4900, which is still a decent amount, rather than risking getting an even worse deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
