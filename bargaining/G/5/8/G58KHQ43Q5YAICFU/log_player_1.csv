"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will affect me more than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. This is a compromise, but considering the inflation, I need to ensure I get a larger share to compensate for the loss of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is higher than the last one, it is still significantly lower than what I deserve. I'm willing to compromise but not at the expense of a huge loss due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split, with both of us receiving $500,000. This is the fairest solution considering the impact of inflation on my earnings.  We both share the burden of the decreasing value of the money."
