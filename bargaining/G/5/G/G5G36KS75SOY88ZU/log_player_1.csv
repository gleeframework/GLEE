"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a generous 30% of the original $100. The remaining $70 will be mine, which is a nice chunk of change. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the funds equally, given the diminishing value of money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is a fair one, considering the decreasing value of money with each round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of $60. Let's divide the funds equally and move on!"
