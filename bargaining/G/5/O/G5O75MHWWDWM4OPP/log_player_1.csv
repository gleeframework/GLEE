"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  While it might seem unfair, I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential for inflation in future rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, even considering the 10% inflation.  I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob.  While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I'm trying to be more reasonable given the inflation and Bob's previous rejection.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far.  I'll accept it.  It's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal."
