Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start with a very generous offer, hoping to get this over quickly.  Since the money loses value with each round, I want to secure as much as possible as soon as possible.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount of money.  With the inflation, it's too risky to keep rejecting offers in hopes of a better deal.  I'll take the 500,000 and be happy with it."
