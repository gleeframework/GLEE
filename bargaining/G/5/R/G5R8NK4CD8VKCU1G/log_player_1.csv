"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation rate. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting because it's more than I could have gotten if I waited another round. However, it's still significantly less than half. 

Let's analyze:

* **My position:**  The decreasing value of the money hurts me more than Bob. Waiting too long is risky.
* **Bob's position:** He's likely to keep pushing for a larger share, knowing the inflation disproportionately affects me. 

I need to strike a balance between greed and the risk of losing everything.
