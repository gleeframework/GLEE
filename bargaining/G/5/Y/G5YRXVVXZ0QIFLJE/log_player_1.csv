"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

In this round, I'll gain 400,000, which is worth 80% of the original 500,000 I proposed in Round 1. This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the reduced purchasing power.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains! With my money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious.

In this round, I'll gain 350,000, which is worth 70% of the original 500,000 I proposed in Round 1. This is a relatively low offer, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

In this round, I'll gain 300,000, which is worth 60% of the original 500,000 I proposed in Round 1. This is a very low offer, and I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

Round 7

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I need a better deal to survive the inflation.""
}
