"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't do better than this, can you? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before responding. Considering the inflation, I need to think about the real value of the money I'll be getting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better. The 50-50 split is too even, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer now that I've rejected Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up much. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up much, I'm giving up more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of money, I need to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. The 40-60 split is a bit disappointing, but I think I've squeezed out as much as I can. It's better to take what I can get and end the game rather than risking another round and potentially getting an even worse deal."
