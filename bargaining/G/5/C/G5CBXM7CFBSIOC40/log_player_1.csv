"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than your previous offer. This feels more fair, let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script on me. My gain is still 600,000, but Bob's gain is now 480,000 due to the 20% inflation. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split in my favor. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```"
