Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can finish this quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I lose a lot more in this round, it's better than getting nothing at all."
