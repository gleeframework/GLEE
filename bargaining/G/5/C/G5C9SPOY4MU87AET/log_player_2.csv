"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, Bob. A slightly larger share for me since I'm facing the bigger risk with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll see if I can negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's avoid the risk of inflation and get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a bigger risk. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a more even split.  The risk of inflation is making it harder, but I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a closer split. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not going to give away a large portion of the money. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable solution before the inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
