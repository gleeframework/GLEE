Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my good offer, now I have to take a bigger share. Think carefully. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real. This is my last reasonable offer.  Take it before inflation eats away at everything!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not afraid of inflation, you are. My share just got bigger. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are too significant to ignore. While accepting Alice's offer means getting a smaller share, it's still better than risking another round and losing even more to inflation."
