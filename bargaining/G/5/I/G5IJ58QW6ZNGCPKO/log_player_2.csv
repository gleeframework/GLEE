This is a tough situation. Here's why I made this decision:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The money is rapidly losing value for me. Waiting any longer means a drastically reduced payout, even if I could get Alice to agree to a more favorable split.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems content to wait me out, knowing the inflation hurts me more. Her offers are getting worse, not better.

Taking $300,000 now is better than risking an even lower amount in future rounds or, worst case, getting stuck with a tiny amount if I have to make a desperate offer in the final round."
