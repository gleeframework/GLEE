Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is becoming a serious factor.  Her perception of value is diminishing far faster than Bob's. It's highly likely she'll be far more agreeable in the next couple of rounds as the deadline pressure increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53,
""alice_gain"": 47,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer before inflation eats away at your potential winnings even further. This is your last chance for a decent share!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying pressure:** The message aims to make Alice nervous about the shrinking pot, potentially pushing her to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Slight concession:** Offering 53/47 is a small move towards Alice's previous offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate but maintaining a firm stance.
* **Strategic timing:**  With 6 rounds left, there's still a buffer to negotiate further if needed, but the end is near enough to make Alice seriously consider the dwindling value."
