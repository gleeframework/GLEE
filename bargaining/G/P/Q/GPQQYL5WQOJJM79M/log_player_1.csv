"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of its value in the first round. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth $40 in the first round. However, if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, I'll have to make a new offer, and the money will be worth 5% less than in the first round.

Considering the potential future value of the money, I think it's better to accept this offer and get $40 now, rather than risking getting less in the next round due to inflation. So, I'll accept Bob's offer.
