"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
``` 

I'm going to try and get closer to a 50/50 split.  Since Bob is getting greedy, I'll offer him a bit more, but I still need to get most of the money given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is being very greedy and I am not going to settle for such an unequal split. Even with inflation, I can still get a much better deal if I keep rejecting his offers.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still aiming for a better deal than Bob's last offer, but I'm also acknowledging that inflation is making my position weaker. This offer gives me a larger share, but it's also a compromise to hopefully get Bob to accept."
