"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%. Let's see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 60-40 split in his favor, huh? That's not a bad offer, but I'm not willing to give him such a large share just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer in Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split in his favor, which is a slightly more favorable deal for him. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 45% is a fairer split for me.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still going to need a bigger share.  Let's try 70/30. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer in Round 4 is quite aggressive, with a 70-30 split in his favor! Given the inflation, Bob's share is worth even less than before, but it's still a significant amount. I'm not willing to give him such a large share, so I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to make a new offer that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was a 70-30 split in his favor, I'll try to counter with a 50-50 split, which is a more even division of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the money 50/50. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer.""
}
```

This way, we'll both get an equal share of the money, and we can avoid further negotiations."
