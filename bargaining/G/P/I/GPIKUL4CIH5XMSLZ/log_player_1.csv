"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the original $10,000.

The proposed split is 30-70, which is not as favorable to me as my original proposal. Considering Bob's message, I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a slight edge.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to a 50/50 split. It's getting harder to afford your generosity. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the original $10,000.

However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain of $6000 is actually worth 85.74% of the original $7000, which is less than his previous offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. It's time to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
