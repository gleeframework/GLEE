Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking a large chunk, but leaving a little for him to consider. I'll be curious to see if he bites, or if he's going to play hardball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a fair deal for both of us, and we both get a significant amount of money. While I could potentially hold out for more, the risk of getting nothing at all is too high, especially with the inflation factor."
