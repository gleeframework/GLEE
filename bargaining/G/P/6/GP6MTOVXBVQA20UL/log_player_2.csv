"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. I believe I can get a better deal than 40% of the initial amount.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hitting us both hard, so I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation rates, I'm actually losing more value than Alice. I'd like to make another counteroffer that takes into account the disproportionate effect of inflation on my gain.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is affecting me more, I think this adjustment is necessary to keep things fair. Let's not forget, we're both losing value with each round.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll see the reasoning behind my proposal."
