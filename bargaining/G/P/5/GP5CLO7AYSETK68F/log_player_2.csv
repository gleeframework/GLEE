"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm leaving you a small share. Accept this and we'll both get something. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to get something, it's very little and the inflation will heavily penalize Alice in the next round. This is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
