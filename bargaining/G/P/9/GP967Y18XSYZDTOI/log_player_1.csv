"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Let's see if we can do better in the next rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping to build a foundation for a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* Alice: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600 (since my gain is worth 10% less)
* Bob: 6000 * 0.95 = 5700 (since Bob's gain is worth 5% less)

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
