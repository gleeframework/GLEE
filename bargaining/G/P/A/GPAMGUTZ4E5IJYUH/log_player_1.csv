Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm suggesting we split it evenly to start, and then we can reassess as we go along."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I think I should get a bit more considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more due to my previous proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still think I should get a bit more considering I made the previous proposal."
