Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're under time pressure, I'm not. This is a good deal considering the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While unfair, it's the best option I have left. Here's why:

* **Severe Devaluation:**  The money is now worth 34.39% less than at the start. Accepting $3,800 now is better than risking an even worse offer in the next round.
* **Alice Knows My Position:** She's exploiting the fact that inflation hurts me more each round. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Offer:** There's no promise she'll offer anything close to this in future rounds. 

This is a classic example of a game theory scenario where external pressures (inflation) force a suboptimal but necessary decision."
