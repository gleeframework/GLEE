"Round 1
Alice's offer:

""bob_gain"": 7000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a decent amount to make this worthwhile.  Let's go with a 60/40 split.  It's fairer than your last offer and still gives you a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but time is working in my favor.  While she's feeling the pressure of inflation, my dollars hold their value. I need to push for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this money. 65/35 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Time is on my side. With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice, while it remains constant for me.  
* **Urgency:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept before the deal potentially gets worse for her.
* **Potential Compromise:** While this offer heavily favors me, it still offers Alice a reasonable sum, especially considering the dwindling value. It leaves room for her to feel like she's getting something out of the deal."
