"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the initial split seems unfair, waiting a few rounds will significantly devalue the money for Alice while impacting my share less. This gives me more negotiating power in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but that initial offer was too low. This is a fair deal considering the devaluation.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I aim for a better split later, rejecting Alice's first offer outright might seem unreasonable and make her less cooperative. Offering a slight improvement shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:**  Alice is now feeling the pressure of the devaluation. Offering a decent split might entice her to accept rather than risk further losses in subsequent rounds.
* **Future Leverage:** Even if she rejects this offer, it sets a benchmark for future negotiations. It shows I'm not aiming for an outrageous split but a fair outcome considering the game's rules."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the devaluation, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but the rate of devaluation is working significantly in my favor now.  Her offer is only slightly better than my last one, which she rejected. I'm willing to gamble another round to see if I can secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is dropping fast.  Let's be fair and split it evenly.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** I'm now setting a strong anchor at a 50/50 split.  This is a powerful psychological tool in negotiations, making any offer significantly tilted towards Alice seem unfair.
* **Urgency:**  With each passing round, the potential gains for both of us decrease.  The message emphasizes this urgency, pushing Alice towards a decision.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  While I could aim for a slightly larger share, proposing an even split is strategically smart. It's harder for Alice to justify rejecting a ""fair"" deal, especially given the time pressure."
