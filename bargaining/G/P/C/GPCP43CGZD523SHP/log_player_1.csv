"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I'm taking a slightly risk-averse approach. I offer Bob a small share, hoping he might accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation.  If he rejects, I can always adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous proposal, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal.  Since inflation is only impacting my earnings, I'm motivated to continue negotiating for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

In this round, I'm countering Bob's offer by offering him a slightly lower share. I'm confident that Bob understands the impact of inflation and will likely accept this proposal to secure his share before it shrinks further. If he doesn't, I can always adjust my offer again in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now more appealing, considering the significant inflation impact.  I'm not guaranteed a better deal in the next round, and the risk of further inflation makes accepting this offer a wiser choice."
