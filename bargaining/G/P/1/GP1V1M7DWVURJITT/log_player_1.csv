"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as happy with Bob's offer as I was with my initial one. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than I did in Bob's offer, but not so much that it's unrealistic."
