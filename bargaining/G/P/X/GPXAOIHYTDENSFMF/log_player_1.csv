"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give you the majority. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to get a good chunk. Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
