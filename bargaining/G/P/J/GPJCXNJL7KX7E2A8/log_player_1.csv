I propose Alice takes $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  It's a big split in my favor, but I think it's a fair starting point given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a more even split this time.  I recognize that my initial offer was too aggressive, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
