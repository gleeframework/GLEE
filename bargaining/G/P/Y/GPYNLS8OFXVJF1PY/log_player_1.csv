"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 2K, I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  This way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's see... I was hoping to get a bigger share, but I guess Bob's proposal is a reasonable one. Since the money is worth less with each round, it's better to take what we can get. I'll accept the offer.
