{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, I'll consider the actual value of the 15 dollars I would get as 11.25 dollars (100% - 27.1% = 72.9% of the original value). Similarly, the 85 dollars Bob would get is worth 73.75 dollars (100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of the original value).
