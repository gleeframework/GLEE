# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take a larger share, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of $5000 in the previous round. I'd like to negotiate further.
