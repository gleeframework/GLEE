"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly.  Let's see if he's happy with 10% of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm going to reject his offer.  Even though the money is worth less to me now, I can still do better than getting a measly $1000.  I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more balanced offer this time.  While Bob is being greedy, I don't want to push him too far and risk losing everything.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being greedy! I'm going to reject his offer. He's taking advantage of the inflation affecting me more than him, but I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'm hoping he'll realize that if he keeps this up, he might end up with nothing.  Let's see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still trying to hold out for a fair share. I'm hoping he'll recognize that if he keeps rejecting offers, we might both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn!  I'm going to reject his offer again.  He's taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving up.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, even though time is running out. I'm hoping he'll see that we can both get something if we work together."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time.  We are running out of time, and I'm concerned about the impact of inflation on me.  I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to him, but I'm also prepared to push for a better deal if necessary."
