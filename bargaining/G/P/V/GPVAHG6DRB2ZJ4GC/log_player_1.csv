I'm starting with a high offer for myself, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to make it seem fair.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not happy with this offer!  I'm taking a huge loss in this round, and I know I can do better. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to be a little more reasonable this time, while still getting a good share.  I'm going to offer Bob a larger share, hoping that it will make him more likely to accept."
