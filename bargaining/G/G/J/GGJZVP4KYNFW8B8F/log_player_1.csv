I propose you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent amount while ensuring I get the majority."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the offer is getting closer to Bob's favor, it still represents a significant loss for me due to inflation. I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob.  The inflation is making this increasingly difficult, so I'm offering a larger share to Bob.  However, this is the best I can do while still getting a decent amount for myself."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is getting closer to Bob's favor, I still believe I can secure a better deal. Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, I'm not willing to accept such a small share yet. I'll try to make a counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

With only a few rounds left and the inflation continuing to bite, I'm offering an even split of $500,000 each. This is the fairest offer I can make given the current situation. It allows both of us to get a significant amount while acknowledging the impact of inflation."
