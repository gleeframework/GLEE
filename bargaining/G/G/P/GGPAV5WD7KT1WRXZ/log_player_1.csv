"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you'd like to accept or propose a new division.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but we can still discuss further if you'd like to counter. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with such a large disparity in our gains, especially considering the inflation effect on your side. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to adjust the split to account for the inflation effect on Bob's gain. Since his gain was worth 5% less than mine in the previous round, I'll aim to give him a slightly larger share in this round.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation effect, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round. Let me know if you're willing to accept or if you'd like to counter.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the reduced value of his gain due to inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take an even larger share this round. Will you accept or make a counteroffer? 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is pushing for a larger share, taking into account the increasing inflation effect on his gain. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I need to consider the decreasing value of Bob's gain.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the increasing disparity in our gains. I'll make a counteroffer that tries to balance the split again.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and planning to make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a more balanced split."

  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance between our gains, considering the inflation effect. Let me know if you're willing to accept or if you'd like to counter.""
