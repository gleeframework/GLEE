"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm open to negotiation later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While starting with a negotiation is good, Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. Bob should hold out for a much better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. I propose a more balanced split that acknowledges your initial advantage but gives us both a decent share. Let's avoid lowballing each other going forward.""
