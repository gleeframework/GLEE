This is a low offer for Bob, and there's plenty of time to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a more equitable split. Let's see if Alice accepts it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit low, and the inflation is starting to affect both of us.  I need to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but I'm still aiming for a more favorable split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now an even split. While inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly, it's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all with further rounds."
