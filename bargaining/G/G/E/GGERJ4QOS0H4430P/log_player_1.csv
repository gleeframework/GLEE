I'm going to offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself.  I want to see if he'll accept a small amount early on.  We'll see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  Bob's offer is much fairer than mine was, but I can do better. I still have plenty of rounds left, and I can exploit the inflation more to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $4,000 this time.  I think he'll be more motivated to accept this offer, since it's higher than my initial offer and he knows I can offer him less in the future. I'll keep $6,000, which is still a good deal for me, and I'll have the option to make a better offer later on if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than my last one, the inflation has started to affect me significantly. However, I still have 8 rounds to go. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. There is still a chance I can get a better deal, or at least a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob an even split of $5,000 each.  The inflation is really starting to hurt me now, and I'm not sure I can get a much better deal.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a fair split, considering how much the money will be worth if we keep going."
