"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping most of the money 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm actually getting $400,000 is equivalent to $500,000 in the first round. Not a bad offer, but I'm not sure I want to settle for this.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a fair share""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I get $450,000 and Bob gets $550,000. I'm trying to be more generous than Bob's last offer, but still trying to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to keep the majority of the money 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

Considering that my share is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm actually getting $300,000 is equivalent to $588,235 in the first round. Not a great deal, but I'm not sure I can do much better.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and pay up.
