Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose.  Meet me in the middle and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The inflation is heavily impacting both of you, but especially Bob. Waiting any longer will drastically reduce the overall value of the money. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in a later round isn't worth the risk. The potential gain is minimal compared to the potential loss if Bob becomes even more desperate. 
* **Bob's Position Weakening:**  Bob's message indicates increasing desperation. He's realizing the game is working against him. This implies he's unlikely to offer a drastically better deal in subsequent rounds. 

Accepting 55% now secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation, and avoids the risk of ending up with a much smaller share if the game continues."
