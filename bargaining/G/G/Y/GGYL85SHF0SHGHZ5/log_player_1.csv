"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 10% decrease in value, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly more even split."

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and getting a good deal."
