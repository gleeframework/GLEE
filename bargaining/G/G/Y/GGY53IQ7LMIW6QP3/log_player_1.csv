"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll think about it in terms of the actual value I'll get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than $6,000, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to take care of myself too.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is 30% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I still think I can do better. Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

I'll consider Bob's offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money I'll gain due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise, considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain."
