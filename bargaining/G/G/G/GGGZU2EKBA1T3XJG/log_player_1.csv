"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that favors me significantly, as the inflation will work against me in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes accepting Bob's offer the most logical choice. My share would be worth less if we continue to the next round."
