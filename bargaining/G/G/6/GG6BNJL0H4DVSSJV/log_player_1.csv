"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of $5000, or $4,750. And Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of $10,000, or $6,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

For now, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll try to get a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed towards me, but I'm still trying to be reasonable and fair. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share to make up for the inflation, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual values considering the inflation effect.

My gain of $4500 is worth 90.74% of $5000, or $4,537.

Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 73.33% of $10,000, or $7,333.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. I'm getting a slightly smaller share than in the previous offer, but it's still a decent compromise.

I'll accept this offer.
