Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not a generous offer, let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
