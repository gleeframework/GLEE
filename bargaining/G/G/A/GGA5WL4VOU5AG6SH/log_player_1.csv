Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get a slightly better deal for myself. Since the value of money is decreasing, I need to secure a larger share."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Bob is getting more and more greedy. I need to get a better deal for myself even though the money is losing value.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm increasing my proposed share to 80% and decreasing Bob's to 20%.  I'm pushing my luck, but I need to try to secure a decent share for myself.  With the inflation rate, I'm losing a significant amount of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm making a final, desperate attempt.  The value of money is declining rapidly, but I'm going to propose a 90/10 split.  I need to try to secure a substantial share for myself, even though Bob has been incredibly greedy.  This is my last chance to get a reasonable deal."

Round 13
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is my last attempt.  The value of money is diminishing rapidly, but I need to try to secure as much as possible. Even though Bob has shown no signs of compromise, I'm going to offer him 1% of the remaining money. This is a desperate attempt to get him to realize that he needs to concede something in order to avoid a stalemate.  We both will end up with virtually nothing if this continues."
