# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting an offer of only $10! I think I can get a better deal than that. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a reasonable split.""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"

# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI already rejected a better offer for Alice in round 1. This new offer is still too skewed in her favor. I'm not accepting anything less than a more even split. Let's see what the next round brings!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Come on, Alice, meet me in the middle! A 55-45 split is more than fair.""}\n\nYour turn again, Alice!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a serious offer.  Let's end this and both go home with some money. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've rejected worse offers from Alice before, and while this is an improvement, it's still not close enough to a fair split for me to accept. I'll keep pushing for a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. A 52-48 split is a slight edge for me, but it's close enough to half that I think we can both walk away satisfied. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising again.  This is getting ridiculous, let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Alice is slowly increasing her offers, this is still too far from a fair split for me to accept. Given the trend, I expect I can get an even better offer in the next rounds or potentially get closer to my target with my own offers. The game is not over yet! Let's proceed."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm barely above half now. It's time to be realistic; we're running out of rounds. This is as fair as it gets. Let's end this.""}"
