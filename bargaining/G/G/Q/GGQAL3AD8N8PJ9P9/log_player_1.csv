Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is only getting worse for you. Let's settle this fairly with a 50/50 split before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 4 is the most logical choice for Alice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is severely cutting into Alice's potential gains with each passing round. A 50/50 split now is worth significantly more than a potentially better split in later rounds.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is aware of the inflation working against Alice and is unlikely to offer anything better than a 50/50 split. Holding out further risks even worse offers from Bob.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Alice a reasonable share. Rejecting leads to further uncertainty and the potential for significant losses due to inflation."
