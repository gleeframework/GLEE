While Alice's proposal is a decent starting point, I believe we can do better. It's worth exploring other options to see if we can find a more advantageous split."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This is a fair starting point, and we can both benefit from a deal sooner rather than later.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but time is working against me.  I'm willing to compromise slightly from my previous offer. Let's close this deal and both walk away with a good amount! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
