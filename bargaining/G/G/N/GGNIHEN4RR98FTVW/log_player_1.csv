"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll get if I accept Bob's offer:

Alice gain: $6,000 * 0.8 = $4,800 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob gain: $4,000 * 0.95 = $3,800 (due to 5% less inflation)

I'll accept Bob's offer.
