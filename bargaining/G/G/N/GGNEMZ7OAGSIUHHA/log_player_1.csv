"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I am the one proposing the initial split. I believe this offer will be accepted by Bob, but I am prepared to negotiate in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation rate means my potential gain is significantly reduced in the next round. A 50/50 split guarantees me half the initial amount, which is better than risking a worse outcome due to inflation."
