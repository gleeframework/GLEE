"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, is it enough to start?""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 40%. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to split the money evenly, which would give me $500,000 and him $500,000.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an even split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous than before, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair compromise. We can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the lead with a 55% share. I'm not sure I like this one bit...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than I have to. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a good amount for myself."
