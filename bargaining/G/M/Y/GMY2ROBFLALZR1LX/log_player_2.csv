"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. The inflation is hurting us both. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's finish this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is indeed hurting both of us, but it's hurting me more. Holding out for another round is risky, but I think I can get Alice closer to a 50/50 split, especially since she seems eager to finish the game."
