"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000. We can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me taking $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split and reassess in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to compromise. This is a good starting point, but I'd like to take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value I'll get.

My gain of $2,500 is worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $2,000.

Bob's gain of $7,500 is worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $7,250.

I'm not sure if I want to give up $2,000 for $7,250, considering the initial offer I made was a 60/40 split. I'd like to keep negotiating.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's split the remaining money with you getting $7,000 and me getting $3,000.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal. You're getting closer, but I think I can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4,500 is worth 44.8% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $2,240.

Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 55% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $5,500.

Considering the value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to give up $2,240 for $5,500. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 38.4% of its original value now. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to your desired share, but I still need to get a fair deal. Let's try again with me getting $3,200 and you getting $6,800.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up more than that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4,000 is worth 40% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $2,000.

Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 60% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $6,000.

Considering the value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to give up $2,000 for $6,000. I'd like to get a better deal, but I'm also aware that we're running out of rounds.

However, I think this is a relatively fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values. I'll accept this offer.
