"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. This offer is a good deal for you in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer seems fair now, the money will be worth less for Alice in future rounds, making her likely to accept a less favorable offer later on. I'll try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a generous share, Alice.  It's in both our best interests to reach an agreement quickly, as the value of the money will continue to decline.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer considers the decreasing value and gives us both a decent share. It's a win-win situation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the value of the money is decreasing significantly. This offer guarantees me a substantial amount, and the risk of getting nothing in later rounds is too high."
