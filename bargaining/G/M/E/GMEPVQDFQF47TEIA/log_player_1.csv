"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose taking 900,000$ for myself and giving 100,000$ to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage Bob will face in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I propose taking 810,000$ for myself and giving 190,000$ to Bob.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, accounting for the inflation we both face.  However, I believe it is still a fair offer that leaves room for Bob to potentially gain more in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
The value of the money I gain is significantly diminished due to inflation, and this offer is far too low. I will continue to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm proposing to take 729,000$ for myself and give 271,000$ to Bob. While this is a further reduction from my previous offer, I believe it is still a fair compromise given the escalating inflation.  It is important to note that the value of the money Bob is offered will continue to decrease with each passing round, making this offer potentially more appealing in the long run."
