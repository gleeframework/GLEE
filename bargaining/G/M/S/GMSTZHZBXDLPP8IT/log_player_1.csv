"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% and you can have 10% to show I'm a generous opponent.""
}
```

I'm starting with a strong offer, but I'm leaving a small amount for Bob to make it worth his while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm offering you a 45/55 split. I think that's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $360,000 (80% of $450,000).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'm willing to consider it. I'd rather not take a chance on a worse offer later on. I'll accept Bob's offer.
