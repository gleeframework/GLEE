"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose to keep 90$ and give Bob 10$. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Although Bob's proposal gives me 20$, it's significantly lower than the 90$ I proposed in the first round.  Even with inflation, I am confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose keeping 80$ and giving Bob 20$. I'm reducing my share slightly to reflect the inflation, but still offering a generous deal."
