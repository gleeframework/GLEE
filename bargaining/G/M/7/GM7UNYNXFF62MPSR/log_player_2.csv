"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'll propose a division that benefits me more, considering the decreasing value of money.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please clarify how the inflation affects the total amount. Does the total amount of $10,000 remain the same, but the value decreases, or does the actual amount get reduced by 10% for me and 5% for Alice in each round?\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. The money is worth 10% less for me now, so I need to adjust the division accordingly.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her response.\n\n###\n\nAlso, to confirm, the total amount of $10,000 remains the same, but its value decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Alice in each round, correct?\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. The inflation is hurting us both, but it's hitting you harder. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in Round 3. Given that the money I gain is now worth 19% less than in the first round due to inflation, and considering Alice's message that this is her final offer, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this deal rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease confirm the acceptance and let's conclude the game.\n\n###\n\nIt was a strategic game considering the impact of inflation on our gains, and I'm satisfied with the outcome.\n\n###\n\nThanks for facilitating the game! If you want to play again or try a different scenario, I'm game!"
