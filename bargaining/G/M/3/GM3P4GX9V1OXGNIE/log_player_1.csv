"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 400,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 600,000 dollars for myself."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think for a moment... and decide to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I'll have to be strategic.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 550,000 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu!

It seems Bob is sticking to his previous offer. Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
