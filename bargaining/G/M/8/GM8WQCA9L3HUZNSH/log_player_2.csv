"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small amount and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a better share of the money. The 1000 dollars offered is a very small fraction of the total amount, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and get a more favorable proposal. Additionally, the inflation factor doesn't kick in until the next round, so I don't have to worry about the value of the money decreasing just yet. Let's see what I can propose in the next round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation that will affect my share in the next rounds.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to propose a more balanced split, with 40% of the money going to me and 60% to Alice. Given the inflation factor that affects my share, I believe this is a reasonable offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me in subsequent rounds. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair proposal and accept it, ending the game."
