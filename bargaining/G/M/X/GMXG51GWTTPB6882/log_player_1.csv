"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a larger share, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll be getting $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's a significant reduction from my initial proposal of $5,000.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A bit more balanced, but still a fair deal""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a bit more skewed in my favor, but I hope Bob will see the value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, I'll have to be very careful with this offer. If I accept, I'll be getting $3,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal of $5,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal. Bob's aggressive offer has given me a chance to re-evaluate my strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Bob's aggressive offer has given me a chance to regroup and come back stronger.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""A more balanced offer, with a bit more for me this time""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a bit more in my favor, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to get a decent share. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to my target with this offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth a lot less for me now!

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive again, and I'm not thrilled about it. If I accept, I'll be getting $3,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal of $5,000.

However, I'm running out of rounds and options. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the $3,000 and hope that Bob will keep his word and stick to the deal."
