"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money close to evenly, with a slight advantage for me to account for the faster devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that benefits me more, considering the inflation rates. I'll propose a division that takes into account the devaluation difference between us, aiming for a better gain for myself while still appearing reasonable for Alice to consider.\n\n###\n\n# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more to compensate for the lower devaluation on my end. How about we adjust the split to give me a slight edge this time? \n# Bob gain: 550000 \n# Alice gain: 450000 \n\n###\n\nPlease relay this proposal to Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll send my offer in the JSON format as requested:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more to compensate for the lower devaluation on my end.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us.  I propose a 50/50 split to end this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point, especially since the money's value is decreasing more significantly for Alice. Accepting this offer might be the best option to maximize my gain before the value drops further.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
