"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm actually gaining $400,000 in this round, not $400,000 in nominal terms. But I'll pretend that I don't know this and just consider the nominal values.

I don't like Bob's offer because I'm getting less than half of the total amount. I'll reject this offer.
