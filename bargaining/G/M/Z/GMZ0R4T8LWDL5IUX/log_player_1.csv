"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for our negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about the proposal.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 45% of the money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a slightly better deal than before. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a slight improvement from my initial offer, but still gives me a majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth less and less. A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50-50 split is a fair deal, and it's better than risking going into further rounds with the money's value decreasing even more."
