Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is money, and money is losing value. Let's settle this now. I'll take $55, you get $45.  It's the same split you offered, but fairer considering the time factor. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
