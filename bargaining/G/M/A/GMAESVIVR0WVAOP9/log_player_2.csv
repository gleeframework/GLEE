"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. This offer is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting 4500$ now might seem okay, but losing 10% of the potential total each round will quickly add up.  I need to aim for a larger share, taking into account the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's be realistic and close this deal now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Justified:** This offer is a strong counter, aiming to secure a larger portion of the money for Bob while acknowledging the shrinking pot. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Emphasizing the impact of inflation creates a sense of urgency for Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While a 60/40 split is a strong opening, it leaves some room for negotiation if Alice makes a counter-offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm coming down a bit, but we need to find a middle ground soon. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still not enough to offset the impact of inflation. Accepting 4800$ now is a worse deal than her initial offer of 4500$ due to the 19% decrease in value.  I need to hold firm and hope she makes a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This offer is fair considering the losses we're both facing. Let's end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm reducing my demand slightly from 6000$ to 5800$, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Shifting Blame:** By framing the offer as ""fair considering the losses we're both facing,"" I subtly shift some of the blame for the lower amount onto the inflation factor, even though it only affects me.
* **Increased Urgency:**  With each round, the shrinking pot makes reaching a deal more critical. I continue to highlight the time pressure to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair 50/50 split. Let's end this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **The Tide is Turning:**  While a 50/50 split seemed unreasonable in earlier rounds, the impact of inflation is becoming severe. Accepting 5000$ now, even with the 34.39% reduction in value, is better than risking a worse offer or even reaching the final rounds where the gains will be significantly smaller. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice is likely aware of the pressure inflation puts on me and is using it to her advantage. Waiting longer might not result in a significantly better offer from her. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  The longer this goes on, the closer we get to both getting nothing. It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable, albeit not ideal, amount."
