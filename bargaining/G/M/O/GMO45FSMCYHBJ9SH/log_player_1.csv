"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I still have the same value for the $300,000 as I did in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all the power!""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway on the middle ground, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I still have the same value for the $450,000 as I did in the first round.

However, considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for him than my previous offer, since he's getting more money in real terms. I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
