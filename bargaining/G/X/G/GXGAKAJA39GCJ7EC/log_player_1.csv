"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a small amount to keep him interested in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50/50 split. That's a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage. I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation, the money is worth 60% of its original value now. I'll make a new offer:

}

This way, I'm still trying to maintain a slight advantage, but giving Bob a bit more than in my previous offer."
