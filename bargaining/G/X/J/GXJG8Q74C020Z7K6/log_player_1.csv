Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiation, and that Bob will find it acceptable.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I get less than my initial offer, the inflation makes it worth it to accept this offer. I'd rather get 500,000 now than risk getting nothing at all in a later round."
