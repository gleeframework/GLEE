Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too generous towards yourself. Let's be practical - I'll take a larger share to end this quickly, considering the money will be worth less if we drag it out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
