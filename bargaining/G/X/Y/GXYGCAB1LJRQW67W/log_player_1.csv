I'm starting with a generous offer, but I want to ensure I get the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, 500,000 is a significant sum, and with each round the value of the money decreases. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing later."
