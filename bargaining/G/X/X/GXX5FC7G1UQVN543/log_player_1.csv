"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a classic ultimatum game.  Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to maximize my gain. I propose a 90/10 split, hoping Bob will accept it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Although it's a much better deal for me than his first offer, it's still very unfair. I have 11 rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my proposed share slightly to 80, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'm assuming he's willing to negotiate, but I want to make sure he knows I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still reject Bob's offer. While the inflation has been impactful, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself. It's a lot of money at stake, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I have 8 rounds left, and the situation could still turn around in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 70, but I'm still hoping to secure a majority of the money. Inflation is making each round more risky, but I'm not willing to give up my bargaining power yet. I'm confident that I can find a better deal than Bob's last offer, especially with 7 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is significantly affecting the value of the money, I am still holding out for a better deal. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can still find a more favorable outcome.  I am not willing to settle for such a small share when I have more time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm still pushing for a higher share, but I'm acknowledging the impact of inflation. I'm lowering my offer to 60, hoping that Bob will finally see the value in settling. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is becoming more real."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can hold out for a better deal. With only 4 rounds left, the stakes are getting higher, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only 3 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high. I'm willing to settle for an equal split. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
