"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm going for the most aggressive strategy, leaving Bob with just $1. If he rejects this offer, he knows that in the next round, I will get to propose again, and I'll likely offer him even less.  Let's see if he's willing to risk it all for a potential larger share later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a classic game theory scenario, and Bob's offer is the best I can realistically expect. I'll take the 500,000 and run!"
