"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I propose a 81/19 split, slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal. This reflects the diminishing value of money due to inflation, but also offers Bob a slightly larger share than his previous proposal, indicating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm proposing a 72.9/27.1 split, continuing to reduce my share slightly to account for inflation. This offer provides a good compromise and gives Bob a more significant share than his previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I am proposing a 65.61/34.39 split.  This further reduces my share, acknowledging the accelerating inflation, but offers Bob a more significant share than his last proposal.  It's time to reach a compromise to avoid losing everything!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 343900 
# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly impacted my earnings, this offer is still better than risking losing everything by continuing to reject.  It's time to accept and secure at least some gain."
