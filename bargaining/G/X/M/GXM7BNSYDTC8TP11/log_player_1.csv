"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI am offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I am incentivized to reach an agreement quickly to maximize my gain. By offering Bob a significant portion, I aim to create a compelling reason for him to accept and conclude the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI am rejecting Bob's offer in the second round. Although the value of money has decreased due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, I have an advantage in waiting for a potentially better offer. Additionally, accepting a 55/45 split would mean I get $450,000, which is less than what I initially offered to Bob in the first round ($400,000). I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, this is the best you'll get""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I am making an offer that is more favorable to me, considering the impact of inflation on the value of money for both of us. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less in each round, and mine is worth 10% less, the pressure is on Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later. By offering Bob $300,000, which is less than what I offered in the first round but still a significant amount, I am taking a firmer stance in the negotiation. The message I included emphasizes that, given the effects of inflation, this is likely the best offer Bob will receive, aiming to persuade him to accept and end the game in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a smaller share this round to avoid further inflation, and we can both benefit in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I am accepting Bob's offer. Although the value of money has decreased significantly due to inflation, Bob's offer of a 60-40 split is the same as my initial proposal in the first round. Given that the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob compared to the first round, it is in both of our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to negotiate and losing even more value. By accepting this offer, I am securing a significant portion of the money, and we are both avoiding further losses due to inflation. The compromise that Bob suggested aligns with my initial proposal, making it a reasonable and acceptable deal at this stage of the game."
