"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 gain from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd actually get $4,800 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $2,000, which is worth 80% of the original $2,500, and Bob would get $8,000, which is worth 95% of the original $8,400.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I think I'd rather try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my $4,800 gain from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd actually get $3,840 in this round.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leave $5,500 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a more attractive offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My $4,500 gain from the previous round is worth 51.2% of its original value, so I'd actually get $2,304 in this round.

Bob's offer is $3,000 for me and $7,000 for him. My $3,000 gain is worth 60% of the original $5,000, and Bob's $7,000 gain is worth 84.21% of the original $8,333.33.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my $2,304 gain from the previous round is now worth 44.6% of its original value, so I'd actually get $1,027.2 in this round.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a small chance to make it right!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $1,000 and leave $9,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a low enough number that Bob will accept, but I'm not sure if it's worth it for me."
