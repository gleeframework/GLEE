Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, aiming to get as much of the money as possible in the first round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer isn't ideal, taking 10$ is better than risking getting nothing. It's also worth considering that Bob might be more inclined to be fair in the next round if we accept this offer."
