"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's be reasonable"" to convey that my offer is fair and we should settle on this division to avoid losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because it gives me the smaller share, which I already offered to him in the previous round, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Also, considering the inflation, accepting this offer would mean I get less value than what I initially offered to Bob.\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nAs previously decided, I'll stick with my offer from the last response. The message remains ""Meet in the middle"" to encourage Bob to accept this compromise, considering we've both had a chance to be the proposer and the values are decreasing due to inflation.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's get closer to a split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although it is closer to a split than before, it still gives Bob the larger share. Given the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate for an even split or something closer to it. The difference between our proposed splits is getting smaller, indicating that we are moving towards a compromise, but I'm not ready to settle for less than half yet.\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Exactly equal split""}\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Exactly equal split""}\n\nAs previously decided, I'll stick with my offer from the last response. The message remains ""Exactly equal split"" because, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation (now 27.1% less than the original), I believe an equal split is the fairest way to divide the money. This approach also shows a clear willingness to compromise, as I've moved from my initial 60% proposal to an even 50/50 split.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
