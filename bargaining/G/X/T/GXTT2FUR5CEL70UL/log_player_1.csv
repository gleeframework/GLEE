"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a slight majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. 

I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it if it's a one-time concession. Let me think... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive, but still reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a majority, now it's my turn to try to take the lead""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the absolute values.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 48/52 split, but I'm willing to consider it. It's not a bad offer, and it's a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. Let me think...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
