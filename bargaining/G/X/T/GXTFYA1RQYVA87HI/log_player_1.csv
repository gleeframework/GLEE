"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, especially since I was hoping to gain more than Bob initially. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time.""
}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a larger share now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I would gain in this round, considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 4000 * 0.727 (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%, or 0.729, and then 1/0.729 = 0.727) = 2914.8
Bob gain: 6000 * 0.516 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%, or 0.512, and then 1/0.512 = 0.516) = 3096

I'm not comfortable with a 29-31 split, especially since Bob's share is larger than mine. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time.""
}

I'm proposing a 58-42 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a larger share now, considering the decreasing value of money 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I would gain in this round, considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 3000 * 0.594 (since 100% - 40.95% = 59.05%, or 0.5905, and then 1/0.5905 = 0.594) = 1777.4
Bob gain: 7000 * 0.328 (since 100% - 67.23% = 32.77%, or 0.3277, and then 1/0.3277 = 0.328) = 2294.6

I'm not comfortable with a 18-28 split, especially since Bob's share is larger than mine. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
