Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me 95% of the money and Bob only 5%.  While it's a very lopsided split, I want to see how he responds. I'm willing to give up a bit more in future rounds if needed, but I want to see how risk-averse he is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, even with the inflation factored in. My gains are reduced by 5% from the previous round, but Bob's gains are reduced by 20%!  I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself, but still offering Bob a significant amount of the money. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm taking the initiative to make a proposal."
