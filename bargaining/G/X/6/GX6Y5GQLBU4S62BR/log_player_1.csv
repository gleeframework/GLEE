"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent share."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 10% less than in round 2, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get a significant majority of the money, considering the decreasing value."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll aim for an even higher share. However, Bob's offer is quite close to an equal split, and I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
