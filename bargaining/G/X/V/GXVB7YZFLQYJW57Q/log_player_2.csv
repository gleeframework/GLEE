Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation is impacting you, Alice, but your last offer was a bit lopsided. How about a 55/45 split? It's a good deal while there's still value left.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round. I'll take $55, you take $45.  It's a better deal than what you offered, and time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
