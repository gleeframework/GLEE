"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm sure we can work something out that's mutually beneficial. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 60/40 split isn't fair enough for me. Let's see what I can propose next.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll try to find a compromise that takes this into account.\n\n###\n\nHere's my proposal:\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. Let's find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair way to account for inflation and keep things even. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation, a 50/50 split seems fair, especially since the money is worth less for both of us with each passing round. It's better to accept this offer now rather than risking further devaluation.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here."
