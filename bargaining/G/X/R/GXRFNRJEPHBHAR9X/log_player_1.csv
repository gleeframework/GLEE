"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 90% of what I would have gained in the first round. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting 60% of the original 100$, which is 60$. 

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll decide to reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 81% of what I would have gained in the first round, due to the cumulative effect of inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get a better deal to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 72% of the original 100$, which is the highest percentage I'm willing to accept at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think this is a fair and reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 72.9% of what I would have gained in the first round (100% - 27.1%).

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since Bob is meeting me in the middle. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later, so I'll decide to accept this offer.
