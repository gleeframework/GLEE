"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing with each round, so I'd better act quickly. I'll accept Bob's offer.
