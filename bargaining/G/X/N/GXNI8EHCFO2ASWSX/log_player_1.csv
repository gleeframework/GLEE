"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly more aggressive offer. You can try to negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less each round, so I need to be strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too aggressive. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better split.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation kicking in, I need to be more cautious and try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

This offer gives me $5,500 and Bob $4,500, which is a more balanced split. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you in the middle this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth even less than before, and he's trying to meet me in the middle. This is a good opportunity to get a fair deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's call it a day. A 50/50 split seems fair, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I think we've reached a good compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
