"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
This is a very uneven split, and while the game doesn't explicitly say it, it seems likely that Alice will try to get as much money as possible for herself. I'll reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split.  Let's each take half of the remaining money after a small deduction for my efforts in getting us to this point.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a bit more than half. How about we split it 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice is getting closer to my desired outcome.  With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, and it's not clear how much longer we can negotiate.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount, and it's better than the possibility of getting nothing in the next round."
