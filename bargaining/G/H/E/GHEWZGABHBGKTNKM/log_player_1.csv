"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to propose!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think a 50/50 split is the most logical. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000.

I accept Bob's offer.
