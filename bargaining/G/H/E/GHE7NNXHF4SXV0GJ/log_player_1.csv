"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 60/40, which is a relatively even split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be a bit more aggressive, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50/50 split, as I'd rather try to get a bit more. However, Bob's message suggests he's being fair, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
