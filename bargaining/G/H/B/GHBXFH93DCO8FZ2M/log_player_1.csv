"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the 50-50 split. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 5% inflation from the previous round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $28, which is 28% of the now-inflated $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the 70-30 split. It's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns."
