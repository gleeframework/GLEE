Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 65-35 split. While we both lose value over time, my loss is less than yours. This offers a fair compromise while recognizing the inflation disparity. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
