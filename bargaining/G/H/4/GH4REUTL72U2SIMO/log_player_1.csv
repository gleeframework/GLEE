"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can have the smaller share if you want to play it safe.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving the door open for Bob to negotiate or accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a bigger share this time, but let's make sure we both get something substantial.  The money is worth less each round, so we need to act now. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-70 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less money. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
