Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation factor. We both get a good amount, and it's better than risking getting less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
