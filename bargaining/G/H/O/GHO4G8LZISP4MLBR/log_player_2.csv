Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonably fair split. I get $5250, you get $4750.  This accounts for the fact that the value of the money decreases for you over time. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more equitable split would be 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This acknowledges the inflation impacting my share, while still offering you a significant portion.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is impacting you, but your previous offer wasn't fair. Let's meet in the middle - I'll come down to $5100, and you get $4900. It's a good deal considering the declining value. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
