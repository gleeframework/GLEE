Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split would be 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This acknowledges the inflation impacting my share, while still offering you a significant portion. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
