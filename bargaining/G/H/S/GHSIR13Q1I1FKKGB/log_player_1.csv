"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to benefit from the division.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair and balanced offer that allows us both to walk away with a significant share of the money. Let's end this game on a positive note. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
