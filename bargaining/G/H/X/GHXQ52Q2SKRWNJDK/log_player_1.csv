"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount, but don't expect to get more than this!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50 is actually worth 40% of the original $100, which is $40. Not bad!

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 50% of the original $100, but I'll assume it is for now.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
