"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic. This is a negotiation, and we both need to benefit. I'm willing to come down a little, but 65/35 is simply too much in your favor.  How about we settle for 58/42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
