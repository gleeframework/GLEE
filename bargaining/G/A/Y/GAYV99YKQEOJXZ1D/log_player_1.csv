"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd actually gain $7,600 in this round. And Bob's $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so he'd gain $1,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd rather not accept a 50/50 split, as it's not as favorable to me as my initial offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 90.5% of its original value. So, if I were to accept the previous offer, I would gain $6,920.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% and keep 60%. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fairer split than before.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 60% for me is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so I'd gain $6,858 in this round. And Bob's $2,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so he'd gain $1,458.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not happy with the 60% split, as it's even less favorable to me than my previous offer. I'll reject this offer.
