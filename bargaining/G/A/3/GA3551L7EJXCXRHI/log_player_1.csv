Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. You can either accept or propose your own deal.""
}
```

Your turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. You can take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75% share for Bob. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

}
```

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 35% share for myself, it's better than nothing, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round."
