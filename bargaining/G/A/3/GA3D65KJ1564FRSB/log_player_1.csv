"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose to take 90% of the money and leave 10% for Bob. It's a good starting point for a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though the offer is less than my initial proposal, the 20% inflation means I'd lose more if I reject and have to wait for another round. 50% is better than nothing."
