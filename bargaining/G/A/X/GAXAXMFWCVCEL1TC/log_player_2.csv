"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We're both losing money with every round, and I think this is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though it's not the best deal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes sense.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting now minimizes our losses.
* **Fairness:**  While I could push for a slightly better deal, Alice's offer is reasonable, and dragging it out might lead to a worse outcome for both of us."
