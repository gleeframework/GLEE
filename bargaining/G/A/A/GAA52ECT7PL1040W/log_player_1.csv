"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob accepts to avoid further rounds and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can secure a larger portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split. This seems like a fair offer considering the inflation risk, and it might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk further rounds and potential losses."
