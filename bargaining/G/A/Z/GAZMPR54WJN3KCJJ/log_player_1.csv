"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n### \n\nI made an offer of $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob, with a message suggesting a slightly uneven split in my favor. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get more this way than if we keep rejecting offers! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer of an even split. Although the offer seems fair and Bob's message emphasizes the benefits of accepting to avoid further inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better deal in the next round, considering the initial proposal I made was only slightly higher than an even split. The inflation impact is noted, but at this stage, I'm willing to proceed to potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n### In this round, I've decided to offer a split that is closer to the middle than my initial proposal, taking into account the effects of inflation which reduce the value of the money with each passing round. By suggesting $5200 for myself and $4800 for Bob, I'm aiming to find a compromise that acknowledges Bob's desire for an even split while still favoring myself slightly. The message emphasizes the consideration of inflation, hoping to convey a sense of urgency and reasonableness in my offer."
