"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to be fair. Let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a slightly larger share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
