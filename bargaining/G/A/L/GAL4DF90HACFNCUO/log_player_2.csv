{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I propose a 9:1 split in my favor. While I understand your initial proposal, I believe a larger share for me is more fair in the long run, especially considering the potential inflation. Let's keep the game going.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we try a 4:1 split. This offers a significant increase for you compared to the previous rounds, while still maintaining a substantial portion for me. Let's aim for a balance that considers both fairness and potential inflation effects. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
