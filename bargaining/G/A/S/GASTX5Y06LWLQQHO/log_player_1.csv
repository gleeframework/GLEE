Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but still leaves Bob with something. I hope he will see the value in accepting it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than nothing, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm rejecting this offer and will propose a new division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer, considering his money is losing value faster than mine."
