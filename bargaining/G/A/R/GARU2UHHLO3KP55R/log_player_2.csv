"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's compromise, it's better than nothing 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous, take it 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting only $43 after starting at a potential $50 is a poor outcome. Alice knows the pressure is on me. I need to hold out hope for a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'm in control, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanism and knows time is on her side. Accepting $44 now is significantly better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing in the remaining rounds.  The potential loss outweighs the shrinking potential gain."
