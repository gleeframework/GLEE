"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a very simple offer, as I don't know how Bob will act in the next round. I want to keep as much money as possible, but I need to make sure he accepts it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting less than I hoped for in the first round, I'm getting something.  It's also likely that if I reject this, Bob will get an even better deal in the next round, and I'll likely end up with nothing."
