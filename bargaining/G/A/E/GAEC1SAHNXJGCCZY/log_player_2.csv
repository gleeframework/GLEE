"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's the first round and we both get the most value out of the money now.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, but 55-45 is not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle between my original offer and yours? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. The inflation is hurting me more than her, so I need to push for a better deal sooner rather than later. Accepting a deal around round 5 or 6 that's closer to 50-50 will be better than accepting this deal now."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I'm willing to make a smaller concession. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's conceded very little ground.  While the inflation is a factor, accepting an offer this far from an even split still hurts me in the long run. It's time to start getting more aggressive to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
