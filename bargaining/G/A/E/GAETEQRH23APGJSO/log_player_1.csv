With only two rounds left, I'm taking a big risk. This is a very high offer, but it's the only way to ensure that I get something. Bob has to accept if he wants anything at all."

Even though the offer is not ideal,  I have to accept.  Inflation has eroded our potential gains so much that getting anything at all is better than nothing.  This game was a difficult lesson in the power of inflation and the importance of taking risks."
