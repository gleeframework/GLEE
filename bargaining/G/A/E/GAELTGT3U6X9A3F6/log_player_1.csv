Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split, considering the inflation, it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, especially on your end, I think a 58/42 split is more than fair for both of us now. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob acknowledges the inflation impacting me more, his offer is still tilting heavily in his favor.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate I'll become, and he's likely banking on that. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation.  Meet me halfway - 52/48.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation is eating into my potential gains quickly. I need to incentivize Bob to settle.
* **Concession:** I'm showing a willingness to move from my previous 55/45 stance.
* **Middle Ground:** 52/48 is a relatively even split, acknowledging that while I'm impacted more by inflation, Bob is also losing value."
