"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced starting point. Let's see if we can work from there. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'd like to see a more even split.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can find common ground.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $10,000, which is $4,500, and I'll take the remaining 55%, which is $5,500."
