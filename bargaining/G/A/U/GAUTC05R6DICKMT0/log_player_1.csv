"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob! It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm the one who's willing to take the risk of waiting for a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take the lead!

I'll think for a moment... I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better one. My current gain of $5000 is still a good starting point, and I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is significantly better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a reasonable amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't think you're getting away that easily! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to make a comeback!

I'll think for a moment... Considering the effects of inflation, Bob's offer is actually worth less to him than my original offer, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal!

I'll think for a moment... Considering the effects of inflation, Bob's offer is actually worth a significant amount less to him than my original offer, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round."
