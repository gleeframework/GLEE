"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50. I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, especially since I'll be getting 40% of the original amount, which is worth 10% less due to inflation. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and hope to make a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""}

I'm trying to make a more competitive offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a bit more for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also preparing myself for another round if needed."
