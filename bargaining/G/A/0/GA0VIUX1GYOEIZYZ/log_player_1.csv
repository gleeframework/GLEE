"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end this early.  It seems like Bob is more sensitive to inflation, so I want to make sure he feels like he's getting something good enough to take."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty insulting, especially after my generous first offer.  I'm not going to accept that. I'll counter with a fairer offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit, but I'm still aiming for a split that's fair considering our different inflation rates. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that continuing to reject offers will only worsen the situation for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still completely unreasonable. Even though I've lost a significant amount to inflation, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'm hoping he'll realize the damage he's doing to his own gains by continuing to reject offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair.  Bob's constant rejections are really hurting his gains. I'm hoping he'll realize that he's losing out on more and more with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly unreasonable. Even with inflation, this offer is not acceptable. I'm going to counter with a fairer offer in the next round, hoping he'll finally realize that rejecting offers doesn't benefit him at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair. Bob's constant rejections are significantly impacting his gains.  I'm hoping he'll finally see the value in accepting a reasonable offer before the inflation completely erodes his potential earnings."
