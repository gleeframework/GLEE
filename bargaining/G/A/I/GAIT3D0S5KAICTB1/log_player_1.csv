"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll get the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my proposal now.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give him 60% of the total, especially considering the inflation rate. Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to be too generous. You can still do better in later rounds if you negotiate wisely.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation rate and gives Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial offer, but still keeps me in the lead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit impatient, but I'm willing to make a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to take its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'll try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 70% of the total, especially considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to get serious. I'll meet you halfway, but don't expect me to give you more than 50% of the total.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the significant inflation and gives Bob a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the current situation."
