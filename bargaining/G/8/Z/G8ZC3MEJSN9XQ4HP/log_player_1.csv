"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, with a message inviting him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable proposal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount.

The offer is 50/50, which means I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000. However, considering the original amount, I'll be getting 50% of $1,000,000, which is $500,000.

I'll accept this offer.
