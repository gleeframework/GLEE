"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 400,000 right off the bat. I want to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round after I make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, Alice.  Let's split it 55/45, considering the inflation difference.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this.  The clock is ticking and the money is losing value fast for me. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to take a large share. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me such a small share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise.  I'm offering a split that's closer to even, but still accounts for your inflation disadvantage.  Let's avoid losing too much money.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm lowering my demand, but this needs to end soon. Time is literally money for me! 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she's lowered it. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to give away such a large portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, considering the inflation we're both facing.  Let's end this now.""
