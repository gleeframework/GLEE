"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, the actual value of the offer is:

Alice gain: $40 x 0.95 = $38
Bob gain: $60

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... It's a bit more favorable to Bob, but I don't want to give up too much.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm not ready to give up that much. Let's try to meet in the middle, but closer to my end.""
}
```"

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting too generous. Meet me in the middle and we can end this!""

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

Alice gain: $35 x 0.8547 = $29.96 (approximately)
