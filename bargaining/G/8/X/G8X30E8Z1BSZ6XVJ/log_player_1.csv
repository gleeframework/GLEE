"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving just $1 for Bob. This is a very aggressive move, but it's a classic strategy in ultimatum games - it forces Bob to think about whether to accept a small amount now, or risk getting nothing if we continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair and reasonable offer. I would rather take half now than risk getting nothing if we continue."
