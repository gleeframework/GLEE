"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain is worth even less now, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the value of money decreasing by 10% each round, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'll try to split the money evenly, but with a slight bias towards myself, since I'm the one making the proposal this round."
