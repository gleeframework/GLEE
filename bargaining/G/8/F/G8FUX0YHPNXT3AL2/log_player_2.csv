"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money fairly, with me taking 60% and you getting 40%.  This ensures a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I reject the offer because I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round, despite the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n### {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor to make up for the higher depreciation on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects us both differently, but a 50-50 split seems like the fairest option considering the circumstances. Let's avoid further devaluation and reach a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### Given the increasing impact of inflation, a 50-50 split at this point seems reasonable. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for both of us, so it's wise to accept this offer and avoid additional loss."
