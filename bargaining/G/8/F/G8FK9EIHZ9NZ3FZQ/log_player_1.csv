"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. My message to Bob is that I'm trying to split it fairly and I'll start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think 50/50 is the best way to split it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll accept it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
