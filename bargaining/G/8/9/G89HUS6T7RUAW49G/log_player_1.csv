"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Early Advantage:** I need to capitalize on the early rounds where the inflation impact on my share is less severe.
* **Fairness:** While I'm aiming for a larger share, starting with a 60/40 split seems fair enough to potentially entice Bob to accept. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message explains my rationale, emphasizing the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. You lose more value each round, so let's settle on this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation factor, it's not favorable to me. Accepting this offer would mean:

* **Significant Loss:** I'm losing $1500 from my initial proposal in Round 1, which is a considerable amount.
* **Unfavorable Trend:** Accepting this sets a trend where Bob can lowball in subsequent rounds, knowing the pressure is on me.

I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a disproportionately smaller share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to adjust my initial ask, but the previous split wasn't equitable for me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my initial demand from $6000 to $5500.
* **Asserting Value:**  I'm making it clear that while I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a deal that significantly undervalues my position.
* **Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, the offer subtly highlights the time pressure, as each round makes the overall pot less appealing for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both want a fair deal. Given the impact of inflation, especially on your end, I believe this adjustment is reasonable. Let's close on this before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using increasingly persuasive language and leveraging the inflation factor, but his offer is getting worse for me! 

* **Unacceptable Loss:**  Accepting this means I'm down to $4200 from my initial ask of $6000, a loss of almost a third of my initial goal. 
* **Manipulation:** Bob is clearly trying to pressure me into a deal that benefits him significantly more. 

I need to hold firm and make it clear that I won't be swayed by pressure tactics. It's time to signal I'm serious about walking away from a bad deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point.  Let's end this now before we both lose out more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm making it absolutely clear that this is my last offer. No more negotiation.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm appealing to a sense of fairness, especially given the increasing losses due to inflation for both of us.
* **Consequence:** Highlighting the potential loss for *both* of us if we continue creates urgency without appearing desperate. 

**This is a calculated risk:** Bob might call my bluff and push for another round. However, I'm banking on him recognizing that:

1. **Continued Delay Hurts Him Too:** Inflation affects his share, though less severely.  
2. **50/50 is Objectively Fair:**  It's difficult to argue against an even split in a scenario where both parties are losing value over time.

This strong stance gives me the best chance of securing a reasonable deal before inflation erodes our potential gains even further."
