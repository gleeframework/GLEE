"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm being fair.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The 20% decrease in value for me is a significant consideration, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than $100,000.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and I'll wait for her response."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, considering the 20% decrease in value for each round. I'll propose a 60-40 split, hoping that Alice will accept it before the money loses more value for both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and avoid further loss""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer and message to Alice.
