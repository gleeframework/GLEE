Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, Alice. I need a bigger share to make up for it. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about inflation hitting him harder, his proposal still favors him significantly in terms of the original value.  I need to hold out for a better offer to make the impact of inflation worthwhile."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing a lot to inflation. Let's split it down the middle and be done with it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round. Accepting now mitigates further losses for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate may not yield a significantly better outcome, especially considering Bob's previous offers and the increasing pressure from inflation. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting risks walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
