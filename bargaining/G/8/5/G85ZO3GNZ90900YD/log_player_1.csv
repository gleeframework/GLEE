"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation we both face. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, but I need to think strategically. 

Let's analyze:

* **Current Round:** Round 2
* **My Discounted Gain:** $4500 is less appealing than my initial offer, especially with the 10% inflation hit. 
* **Bob's Discounted Gain:** $5500 is good for Bob, and the 5% inflation hit isn't as bad for him.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, I get to propose in Round 3.  I'll need to offer Bob something enticing to avoid further rounds and inflation losses.

**Decision:**  I'm going to take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn. This offer minimizes our losses from inflation going forward. What do you say?""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We both lose more with each round, and a 50/50 split seems the fairest way to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, things are getting serious! Bob is getting closer to an even split, which isn't ideal for me.

Let's analyze:

* **Current Round:** Round 4
* **My Discounted Gain:** $5000 is a significant loss compared to my initial offer, especially with the 27.1% inflation hit.
* **Bob's Discounted Gain:**  $5000 is not bad for Bob, considering he's getting an even split despite the inflation disadvantage.
* **Future Rounds:**  Time is running out! If I reject, only 8 rounds remain. The inflation will keep eating away at the value.

**Decision:**  While not ideal, accepting is the safest option now.  If I push further, I risk getting even less in later rounds.
