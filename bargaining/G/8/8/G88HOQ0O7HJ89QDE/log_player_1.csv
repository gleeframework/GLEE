"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not sure I want to give Bob the majority of the money, but I don't want to prolong the game either. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about the value of the money.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're not willing to give me more, so I'll take a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split slightly in my favor, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a pretty good deal for him, but I'm not sure I want to give him such a large share. I'll have to think carefully about the value of the money.

I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
