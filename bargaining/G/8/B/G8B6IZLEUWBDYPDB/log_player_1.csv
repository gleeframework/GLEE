"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'd be getting 70% of $100, which is worth $70, and Bob would get 30% of $100, which is worth $30. That's a decent offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more.

I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Given that the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, which is worth $55, and leave 45% for Bob, which is worth $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Given that the money is worth significantly less now, a 50/50 split is actually a relatively good deal for me. I'll accept this offer.
