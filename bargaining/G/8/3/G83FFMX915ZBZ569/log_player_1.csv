"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate later""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share of the pie. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, and the money Bob gains is still worth the same as in Round 2. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's get this done""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in Round 1, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
