"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in later rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get something rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. We can discuss this further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: 7200 (10% of 8000)
Bob gain: 1900 (5% of 2000)

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's still a bit skewed towards Bob's favor. However, it's a more even split than my initial offer, and I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
