"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $400,000. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm willing to meet in the middle. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to consider the value of the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this case, I gain $250,000, which is worth 25% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gains $750,000, which is worth 75% of the original $1,000,000.

I'm not willing to accept a 25% share, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. This 55-45 split is a fair middle ground. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I've reduced my share from 60% to 55%, which is a more reasonable offer considering the previous rejection. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Meet me at 60-40 and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I gain $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original $1,000,000.

However, the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 72.9% of the original $1,000,000. In this case, Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 72.9% of the original $1,000,000, which is approximately 0.729 * $1,000,000 = $727,000.

Considering the value of the offer, I gain 40% and Bob gains approximately 72.7% of the original $1,000,000, which is a relatively favorable split for Bob. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at 50-50. This is a fair split, and I'm willing to end the game here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer. Your turn, Bob!"
