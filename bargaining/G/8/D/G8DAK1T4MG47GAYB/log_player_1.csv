Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very simple offer to see how Bob reacts.  I'm assuming he'll want more, but this lets me test the waters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to let him! I'll make my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I hope this will be more appealing to him, as he might not want to risk further inflation and end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and the inflation is really hitting him hard. I'm not going to accept this. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, acknowledging the inflation effect on Bob while still maintaining a significant portion for myself. I hope this will be more appealing than Bob's last offer, and we can reach an agreement before things get too dire."

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the inflation is really taking its toll. I'm not going to give in to his pressure. I'll make my own counter-offer in the next round."
