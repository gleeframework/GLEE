"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can end the game. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is effectively:

```
# Alice gain: 40
# Bob gain: 48
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than the previous one, and it's still a fair split. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
