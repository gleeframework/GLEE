"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division. My message will be: ""I'll take 55, you take 45.""\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll try to take advantage of that.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take 55, you take 45.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time. No more haggling, I'm tired of this inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation, getting 50% of the money now is a better deal than risking another round and losing more value. It's also a fair split, so I'm willing to settle for this. Let's end the game here."
