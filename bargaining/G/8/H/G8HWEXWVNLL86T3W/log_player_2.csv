"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob. This is to encourage cooperation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a good starting point to understand the game dynamics.  While Alice's offer is generous, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make a counter-proposal in the next round, potentially securing a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. While it's less than your previous offer,  it takes into account the inflation factor and provides a fairer distribution in the long run.""}
