"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and balanced split to get us started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50-50 split is a good starting point, let's see if we can improve from here 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the current market conditions""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining money, leaving Bob with 45%. My message is a gentle nudge, hinting that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving up my advantage just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think I deserve a better split given the original amount 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: 4800 / 0.5168 = 9295.12 ( approx)
Bob's gain: 5200 / 0.8586 = 6049.67 (approx)

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is a good one. I'm willing to accept it.
