Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my offer slightly, taking into account the 10% decrease in value for me due to inflation. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation (27.1% less), I believe accepting this offer is the best option. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for me, making it less desirable. Bob's offer of $5300 for me is reasonable given the circumstances, so I accept.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome."
