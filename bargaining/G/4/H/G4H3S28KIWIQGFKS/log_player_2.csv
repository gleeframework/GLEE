Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. This is your chance to secure a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer. Accepting now would mean a significant loss due to inflation. I'm betting Alice will become more open to a fairer split as the rounds progress and the risk of getting nothing increases."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards the middle ground. I'm proposing 55/45 - it's a strong offer considering the time pressure and ensures we both benefit significantly. Let's close this out!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. 70/30 is generous considering the time remaining and the fact you're losing value with every passing minute. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but I need to stay strong. Accepting 300,000 at this stage would mean a huge loss due to inflation.  While risky, there's a chance she'll panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer a more favorable split."
