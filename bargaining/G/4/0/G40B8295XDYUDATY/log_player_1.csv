Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  It's the fairest offer, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting a worse offer later as inflation eats into the potential gains."
