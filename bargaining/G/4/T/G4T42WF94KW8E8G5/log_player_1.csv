"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This is a fair but aggressive offer for the first round. It leaves Bob with a small amount but leaves room for negotiation in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer is still aggressive but acknowledges Bob's previous rejection. It lowers the amount Alice is seeking by $1,000, but the inflation factor makes this offer worth more to her than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all. With 8 rounds remaining, there's a significant risk that further rejections could result in a worse outcome."
