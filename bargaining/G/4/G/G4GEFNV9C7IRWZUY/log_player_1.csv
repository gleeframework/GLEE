Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. I think this is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will agree. Let's see what he says!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it evenly, but I'm willing to take a little more to start things off. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI don't think Bob's offer is fair enough. Since we're playing a game where the next round could bring a better offer for me, I'll reject this one and see what happens next. Maybe I can negotiate a better split!"
