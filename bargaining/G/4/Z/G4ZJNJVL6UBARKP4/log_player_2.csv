"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I believe a slightly favorable split for me in the first round is fair considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. It's my turn to propose now, and the inflation hurts you more than me. How about we turn the tables?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse.  The inflation is becoming a significant factor.  To avoid further losses, I propose a 50/50 split.  This ensures a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal initially, the inflation heavily impacts Alice. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount, whereas further rounds risk Alice making increasingly desperate offers that might be far less favorable.  It's better to secure a guaranteed win than risk losing more value for both parties."
