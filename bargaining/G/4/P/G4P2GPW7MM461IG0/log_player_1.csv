"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair to reverse the roles this round! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the money's value, so I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a better deal!""
}
```"
