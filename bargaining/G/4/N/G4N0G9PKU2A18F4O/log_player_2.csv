"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I think 70/30 is a fair split considering the inflation will affect you more than me.

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm willing to compromise. 65/35 seems fair considering we're both losing money as we go. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This offer gives you a slight advantage, but we'll both lose out significantly if we don't agree soon.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  We both lose if this goes on.  60/40 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are really starting to bite, especially for Bob. While 40/60 isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
