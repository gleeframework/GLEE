"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll think for a moment... I'm not too happy about Bob getting 60, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values.

I'll accept this offer.
