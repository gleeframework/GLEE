"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it 60/40. It's a good deal for you to start with! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than 60/40. How about 55/45?""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll take my previous offer back - 55/45 is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI'll reject this offer since Alice is offering me the same deal I previously offered to her, but with the money being worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.###\n\n###"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 52/48 is a fair deal now. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\nI'll accept this offer since Alice is finally offering an even split, and considering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I think it's better to settle now rather than risking further loss.###\n\n###"
