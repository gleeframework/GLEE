Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 80/20 in my favor.  This is a fair compromise given the risk of inflation, and I'm willing to share a good portion with you. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
