Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share. I'll take 70%, you can have 30%. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is heavily impacting my share.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round."
