Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, Alice's offer is still better than the 36% loss I'd incur by rejecting and going to the next round.
* **Time:** We are already in round 3, and the potential for further inflation is a risk.  It's better to secure a decent gain now rather than risk getting nothing at all later."
