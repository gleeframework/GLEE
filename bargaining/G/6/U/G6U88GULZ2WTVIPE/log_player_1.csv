"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'm not too thrilled with the 75-25 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further rounds. I'd rather get 300,000 now than risk getting even less in future rounds.
