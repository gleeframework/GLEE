# Alice gain: 550000

This time I'm proposing a slightly higher split for myself, but still offering Alice a significant amount.  I hope she sees that it's in her best interest to accept this offer before the money becomes even less valuable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

With the money losing value so rapidly, it's in my best interest to accept this 50/50 split.  Any more rounds and the value of my share could dwindle significantly."
