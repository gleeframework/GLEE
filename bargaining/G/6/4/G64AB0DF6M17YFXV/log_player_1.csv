"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 10% of the money, and keep the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and offering Bob 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal. You can't afford to wait for the next round! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, and Bob's offer is still a significant amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
