# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before accepting."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer. Given the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm motivated to negotiate for a better split to offset the loss in value."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a way to share the remaining money fairly.  This offer is closer to my needs while still acknowledging the inflation impacting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. Further negotiations may lead to even greater losses due to inflation, and this split seems relatively fair given the circumstances."
