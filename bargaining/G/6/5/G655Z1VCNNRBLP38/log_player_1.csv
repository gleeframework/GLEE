"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making an initial offer where I take 60% of the money ($6000) and Bob takes 40% ($4000). My reasoning is that since the money loses value faster for Bob than for me in each subsequent round, he should be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. The message I've included suggests that this split is fair given the differing impacts of inflation on our shares.\n\n###\n\nNow, it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or propose a new division in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way considering the inflation, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the even split seeming fair at first glance, the impact of inflation on our shares differs significantly. Given that the money loses value at a slower rate for me (5% per round) compared to Bob (20% per round), I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds as Bob's share will devalue more drastically, giving me leverage to either accept a future offer that's more advantageous to me or propose one that reflects the changing value more accurately.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I'll make a new proposal considering the updated values after inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, this split is more reflective of the current value.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to $6500 and decreased Bob's share to $3500. Given the substantial devaluation of Bob's share due to the 20% inflation rate per round, I believe this offer is more in line with the current value of the money for both of us. The message to Bob explains the reasoning behind this split, emphasizing the impact of inflation on his share.\n\n###\n\nIt's now Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or to proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
