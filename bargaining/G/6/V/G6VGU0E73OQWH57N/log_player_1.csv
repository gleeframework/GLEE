"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. I'm offering a slightly larger share to me this time, but still keeping it close.  We can both get more than we would if we wait another round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
