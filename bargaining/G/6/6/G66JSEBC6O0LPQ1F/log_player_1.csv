I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm giving Bob something to get him to think about accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is getting more aggressive, but I'm not ready to give up that much yet.  I'll reject his offer and see if he'll come down further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I'll reduce my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding onto a larger share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to play ball."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll meet Bob halfway on his last offer. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds and the possibility of getting nothing at all.  I'm hoping he'll accept this compromise."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting serious. While Bob's inflation advantage is making his offer less appealing, I can't risk getting nothing at all.  I'll accept and take what I can get."
