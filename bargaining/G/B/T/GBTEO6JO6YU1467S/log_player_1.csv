"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice, considering the risk and value depreciation over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the potential for the money to lose value over time. I am willing to compromise and give you a larger share than I would get under a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
