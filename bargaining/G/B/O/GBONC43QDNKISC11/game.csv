4500.0,5500.0,"Let's split it more fairly, Alice. I think 55% for me and 45% for you is a good deal, considering the money is already worth less due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"The value is decreasing Bob, let's be practical. I'll take the slightly larger share this time, 5500$.  We should settle before we lose more to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, we've both lost a significant amount to inflation already. I'm willing to take a bit more to make up for it. This is a fair offer, and I think we should settle before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a bit closer to your last one, but we need to decide now before inflation eats away even more. 5200$ for me, 4800$ for you. Let's do this.",Alice,5,
