"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 30/70 split, especially considering the money is worth less to me now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leaving $5,500 for Bob, hoping to put some pressure on him to accept a better deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give it all away! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gains. I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, the $3,500 I'd gain is worth even less to me now than it was in the previous round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting impatient, Bob. I think I deserve a bigger share now.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,200 and leaving $5,800 for Bob, hoping to put some pressure on him to accept a better deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in to your demands, Alice. You're getting closer, but not close enough! 
# Alice gain: 2800 
# Bob gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, considering the inflation, the $2,800 I'd gain is actually a relatively good deal for me now. I don't think I can do better, and I'd rather take what I can get than risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns."
