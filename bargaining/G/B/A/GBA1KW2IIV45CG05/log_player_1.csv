"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a generous share, but I'm looking for a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway! Let's split it 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000.

I'll reject this offer because I was hoping to get a better deal, especially considering I'm bearing the brunt of the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, so my gain is worth 90% of $450,000, which is $405,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is worth 72.9% of the original $1,000,000, which is $729,000.

I'll accept this offer because it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and I'm starting to feel the effects of the inflation. I think it's a good time to settle for a decent share.
