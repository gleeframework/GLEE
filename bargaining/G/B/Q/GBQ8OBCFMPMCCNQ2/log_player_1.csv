"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the value of money decreases in each round. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amounts Bob is offering:

My gain would be $450,000 x 0.9 = $405,000 (due to 10% inflation)
Bob's gain would be $550,000 x 0.9 = $495,000

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less than the initial $1,000,000. In this round, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, Bob!""
}
