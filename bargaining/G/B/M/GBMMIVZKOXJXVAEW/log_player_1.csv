"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm starting with a very uneven offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept anything at all, or if he's going to try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept the offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting and going to the next round."
