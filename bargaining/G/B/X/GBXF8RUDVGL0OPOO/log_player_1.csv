"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

This is a very aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure a large share of the money.  Since Bob loses 20% of the value of the money each round, he may be more inclined to accept a smaller share than he would if the money held its value.  We'll see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a more even split, it's still a loss for me compared to my initial offer, and I have 10 rounds left to potentially improve my share. I'm not going to settle for a 50/50 split so early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. With each round, the money Bob gets is worth less and less due to the high inflation rate he's experiencing. I'm hoping that will motivate him to accept an offer that's still favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfavorable to me, even considering the inflation.  I'm still confident I can secure a larger share of the money, especially as the inflation is hitting him much harder.  I'll continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a larger share than what Bob offered.  The inflation is affecting him severely, and I'm hoping he'll be more inclined to accept a smaller share in order to avoid losing even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. The inflation is hitting him hard, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I have a few rounds left, and I'm going to keep pushing for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. With each passing round, the value of the money is decreasing faster for Bob.  I'm hoping this will make him more willing to accept an offer that's still beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible! Even with the inflation, I'm not going to settle for such a small share. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm going to continue trying to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

The situation is getting tense. Bob's offer is extremely low, and I'm losing a significant amount of money with each passing round.  I need to secure a deal, but I'm also unwilling to accept a 50/50 split that drastically disadvantages me.  This offer represents a compromise - I'm giving up a significant amount of my initial target, but I'm also avoiding a near-complete loss. It's time to see if Bob will finally accept a reasonable deal."
