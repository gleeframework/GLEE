"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. If we go to the next round, the money will be worth even less to me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a decent chunk, and it saves us both from further losses due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you think my previous offer was skewed, but considering I'm losing value each round, I think this is a reasonable compromise. Further rounds will only hurt me more. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are reflecting that, not actual fairness. While he's right about the inflation impacting him, my potential gains remain static. It's more beneficial for me to hold out for a better offer as the rounds progress.  He'll be forced to be more generous to avoid losing even more value."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be fair, but this has gone on long enough.  This is a compromise that considers the inflation you're facing while still giving me a reasonable share.  Take it or leave it - further delays only hurt us both.""
