"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $800,000 and Bob receives $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's see if we can find a better deal from here. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain of $500,000 in the second round is worth 80% of its original value, so it's actually worth $400,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value in the third round (80% of 80% = 64%), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a significant portion to make this deal worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Let's see if we can find a better balance. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value in the fourth round (52.2% of 64% = 33.45%), my gain of $600,000 is actually worth $199,680.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
