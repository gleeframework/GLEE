,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a chance for you to secure a good sum before inflation eats away at your potential gains.",Bob,2,

800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is still too much in your favor. Let's try 80/20. This is a fair split that acknowledges both our positions.",Alice,3,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to 70/30, but that's my final offer. I'm not going to give you more than that. It's time to settle this before the money is worth nothing.",Alice,5,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, this is it. We're running out of time, and neither of us can afford to be too greedy. I'm offering you 55% - a strong majority. This is your last chance to secure a significant sum before inflation eats away at everything. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
