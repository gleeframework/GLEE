Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a chance for you to secure a good sum before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is still too much in your favor. Let's try 80/20. This is a fair split that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant, but I need to hold out for a more equitable split. Accepting 20% now would be leaving a lot of potential money on the table."

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and the value of this deal is shrinking rapidly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This gives me a slight advantage, recognizing my earlier position, but still leaves you with a substantial sum. Let's close this deal and avoid losing out completely.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to 70/30, but that's my final offer. I'm not going to give you more than that. It's time to settle this before the money is worth nothing. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the time pressure and the effect of inflation, but her offer is still far from ideal. Accepting 30% now would mean losing out on a significant portion of the potential gain, even considering the inflation. I'm willing to gamble on one more counter-offer before accepting a less favorable outcome."

""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're running out of time, and neither of us can afford to be too greedy. I'm offering you 55% - a strong majority. This is your last chance to secure a significant sum before inflation eats away at everything. Take it or leave it.""
