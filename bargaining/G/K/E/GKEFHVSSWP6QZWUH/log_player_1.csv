"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer. I figure if I give Bob a decent amount, he'll be more likely to accept, and we can both walk away with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with inflation, getting 500,000 is better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer."
