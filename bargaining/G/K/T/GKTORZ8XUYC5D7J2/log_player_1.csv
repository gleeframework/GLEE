Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one! Bob is inching closer to a more even split, but it's still in his favor.  I think holding out a bit longer might make him more willing to concede to a closer to even split."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money.  I'm willing to go to 50.5/49.5, but this is my final offer.  We need to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as good as it's going to get. Holding out any longer is too risky, and we might end up with nothing.  A 50.5/49.5 split isn't ideal, but it's better than losing everything to inflation."
