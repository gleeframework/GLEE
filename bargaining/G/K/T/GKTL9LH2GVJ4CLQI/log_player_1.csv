"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I'm still open to negotiations 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is taking a larger share, I'll have to decide whether it's worth it.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50 and end this!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be cautious with this offer. While Bob is offering a slightly larger share, I'm not sure if it's enough to make it worthwhile.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gain, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more. You're getting a better deal, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
