I propose you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm taking a larger share since I'm only losing 5% of the value each round while Bob loses 20%.  Let's see if he agrees."

I'm offering a more even split this time, acknowledging that we both need to compromise to make this work. I'll take $600,000, and Bob can have $400,000."

Bob is still being very unreasonable. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is too far off. I'll try to find a better balance in the next round."

Okay, Bob is making progress. Although the inflation is hurting him more, he's getting a bigger share of the money. I'll take the $450,000, it's not ideal, but it's better than nothing."
