I'm going for a bold move in the first round. I'm offering Bob a single dollar, hoping he'll accept it just to get something.  It's a risky strategy, but with the inflation factor, I want to secure as much of the money as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's a painful reduction from my original offer, it's still a significant gain for me, especially considering the inflation factor.  I'm taking this deal and securing a substantial portion of the money."
