"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can always try to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting $63 (70% of $90, which is the effective value of $100 after the first round) and Bob will get $30.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
