"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. I think it's a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'll take the risk and try to negotiate for a better deal. 60/40 doesn't seem like a great starting point for me. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try 55/45. It's a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for a 50/50 split this time. It's fair and we can both get a decent amount after the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a good deal. The money is worth 9.75% less for me now, and it will only decrease further. I think it's wise to accept this offer and secure my share before the value drops even more. Plus, Alice is right, it is a fair split, and we both get a decent amount."
