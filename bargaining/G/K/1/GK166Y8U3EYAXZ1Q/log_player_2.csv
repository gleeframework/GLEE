# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm not willing to settle for just 5% of the total amount. The decreasing value of money for Alice might pressure her to make a more favorable offer in subsequent rounds. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for me. This is still a good deal for you, let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still believe I can get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth less and less to Alice with each passing round gives me leverage. Her offer is slightly better than the first one, but I'm willing to wait a bit longer to see if she'll come up with something even more favorable.\n\n###"

# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is improving, I still feel that the balance is significantly in her favor. Given the increasing pressure of inflation on her side, I'm inclined to believe she can offer more. I'll continue to push for a better deal, as the rounds still have some buffer before the money becomes worthless for both of us.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but I still believe there's room for improvement. Given the significant loss in value for her with each passing round, I'm expecting her to make more substantial concessions. The pressure is on her side, and I'll continue to push for a better deal.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
