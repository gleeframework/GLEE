"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'll be the one making the first move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $600,000. And Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $615,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
