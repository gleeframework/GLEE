# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's compromise and split it evenly this time. It's better than constantly going back and forth, and we can both get a fair share.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept Bob's offer. Although I'm getting a lot less than my initial proposal, the inflation is heavily impacting my potential gains. Accepting ensures I get something, even if it's less than ideal."
