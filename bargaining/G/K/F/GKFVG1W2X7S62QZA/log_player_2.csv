"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split.  I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  It's important to reach a deal quickly as the value decreases with each round.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you want a more equitable split, but time is working against us both. My offer ensures we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at the value.  Let's be practical and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate.  While I want a fair deal, accepting a 40/60 split now isn't much better than potentially getting nothing if we run out of rounds. I need to signal I'm serious about a more even split but also aware of the shrinking pot.  There's still time for a better offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to go, especially with inflation eating away at the value.  Do we have a deal?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the rounds.  The longer this drags on, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for me. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  A 50/50 split highlights that I'm serious about an equitable outcome and not trying to take advantage of her higher inflation rate.
* **Direct Proposal:** By making a straight 50/50 offer, I'm putting the ball firmly in her court. It becomes harder for her to justify delaying and risking a worse outcome for both of us."
