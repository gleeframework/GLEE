Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more than 40.  Let's split it 55/45. It's fair considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
