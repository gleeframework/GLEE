Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $2,000 and take $8,000 for myself. This way, I'm leaving room for negotiation and giving Bob a decent chunk of the money to make the game more interesting."
