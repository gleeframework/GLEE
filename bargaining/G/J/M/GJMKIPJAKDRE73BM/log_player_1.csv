Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is getting better for him with the inflation, but it's still not great for me. However, if I reject, I'll be making the offer in a worse position next round. 

Let's take the deal.
