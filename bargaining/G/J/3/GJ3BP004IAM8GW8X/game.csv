70.0,30.0,Let's get this done quickly.  I'm proposing I take $70 and you take $30.  It's a fair offer considering the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I'm proposing a more even split.  Let's both get a good amount before the inflation hits too hard.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about $65 for me and $35 for you?  This is a good deal considering the inflation will only hurt you more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need to get a good share before the inflation eats away at my gains.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and this inflation is working against you.  I'm offering you $40 which is more than you'd get if we let this drag on. Take the deal!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle and agree on a split that's fair to both of us. I'm offering you a bit more than you proposed in the last round, and I'm hoping you'll accept.",Bob,6,
