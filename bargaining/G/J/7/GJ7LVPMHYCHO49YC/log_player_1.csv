"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer. Since the money is worth more to me in the first round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is meant to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. You get a better deal in the next round, so it's in your best interest to accept. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob thinks I should accept because the money is worth less in the next round, but I'm not convinced. With a 10% decrease in value for me and a 20% decrease for Bob, I think I can get a better deal if I hold out. Bob's offer of an even split doesn't take into account the fact that the money is worth more to me than it is to him. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Bob. Since Bob is losing more value each round, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share than before, while still trying to appear reasonable.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nLet's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
