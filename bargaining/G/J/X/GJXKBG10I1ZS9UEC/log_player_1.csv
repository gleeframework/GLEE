Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're running out of time. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 

Even though I could try to push for a slightly better deal, the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gain. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with something before time runs out."
