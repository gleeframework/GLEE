"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 800,000 dollars and Bob gets 200,000 dollars. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving up too much control 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 750,000
Bob gain: 750,000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not getting a significant advantage, I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob! I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 342,900
Bob gain: 1,050,000

I'm not happy about this offer, as I'm getting a smaller share than before. However, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
