"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects a fairer balance given the potential for inflation. Let's reach a solution quickly before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
