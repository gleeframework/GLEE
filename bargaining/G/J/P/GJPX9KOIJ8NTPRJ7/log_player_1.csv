"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer gives me almost all the money, but it leaves Bob with a small amount. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a very lopsided deal in the first round. It also sets the stage for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's an improvement over the previous round in terms of my share, it's still significantly less than what I proposed in the first round. It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and  I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in the previous round, but still keeping a significant majority for myself.  This offer demonstrates that I am willing to compromise, but also emphasizes that I believe I deserve a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While it's not my ideal outcome, the inflation has significantly devalued Bob's share, making this offer more appealing.  Continuing to reject could lead to even lower offers in the future, so I'm willing to take what I can get at this point."
