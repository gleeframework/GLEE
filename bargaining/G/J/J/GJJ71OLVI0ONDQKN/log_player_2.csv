"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 95% of its original value after one round, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account. I'll offer to take 55$ and leave 45$ for Alice. This way, I'll get a larger share, but the difference is not too drastic.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to adjust my expectations. Alice's offer is 60$ for me, but considering the 9.75% reduction, that's equivalent to 54.75$ in the first round's value. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 9.75% reduction in value due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. I'll offer to take 58.25$ and leave 41.75$ for Alice. This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave a decent amount for Alice.
