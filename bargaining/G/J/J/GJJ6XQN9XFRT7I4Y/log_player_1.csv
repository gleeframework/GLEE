"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose you take $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a generous offer to start and leaves room for negotiation if he wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still a better deal than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree within 12 rounds. The inflation significantly devalues the money, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice to secure at least some gain."
