"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 1000 and we'll call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 5% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she will be more inclined to offer me a larger share to avoid losing more value. I'll wait for a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. We both get a good share, and we don't lose any more value to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40, and avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for Alice now, she is more motivated to reach an agreement before the value decreases further. I'll wait for a more favorable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation is affecting you more, I think this split is fair. We should settle on this before the value drops further for you.""}"
