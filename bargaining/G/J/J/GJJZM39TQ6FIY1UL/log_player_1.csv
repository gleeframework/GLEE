Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll think carefully before responding.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
