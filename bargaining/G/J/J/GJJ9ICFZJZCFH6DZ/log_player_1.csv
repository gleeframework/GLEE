"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving $200,000 for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation hurting us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already starting to bite!

I'm not convinced that splitting the money evenly is the best option, especially considering the inflation rate. I'd like to get a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping it will be more advantageous for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is getting worse!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving $400,000 for Bob. This should give me a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need a bigger share than before to offset the inflation.  If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we're both going to lose a lot of money. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'm not willing to give up yet. Bob's offer is still a bit too low for my taste, considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal. Maybe Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The pressure is on!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit anxious about the inflation. I need a larger share to make up for the loss in value. Your turn, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving $300,000 for Bob. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it before the value of the money drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with very little.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value now!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I need to think about the long-term consequences of rejecting another offer and potentially ending up with nothing.

However, I'm still not convinced that this offer is the best I can get. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'll also consider the risk of rejecting this offer and seeing what happens next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll see if I can get a better deal or if Bob will make a more attractive offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The clock is ticking!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time and patience. This is my best offer, and I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to get something. Please consider it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving $200,000 for Bob. This is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a smaller share now that the inflation is so high, but I need to get something significant. This is my final offer. If you reject this, we both risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is really on now!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm starting to realize that rejecting it might not be the best option. With the inflation rate this high, the value of the money is dropping rapidly, and I might end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon.

I'll take a deep breath and consider Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's a significant amount, and I might not get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $700,000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than risking everything and ending up with nothing."
