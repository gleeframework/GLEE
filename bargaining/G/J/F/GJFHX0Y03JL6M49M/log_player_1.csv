"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $1000 to get us going""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1000, and I'll take the remaining $9000. I'm framing this as a ""fair split"" to try to set a reasonable tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a good chunk for me, but I'll give you a decent share too 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is now worth less than before, but still a significant amount.

I'll consider the offer and decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3000, and I'll take the remaining $7000. I'm framing this as a ""fair split"" again, but with a slightly more generous offer for Bob compared to my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is now worth significantly less than before.

I'll consider the offer and decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because it seems like a reasonable compromise, and splitting the money 50/50 seems like a fair outcome considering the situation."
