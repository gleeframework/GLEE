# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not budging on this offer. Take it or leave it.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd ideally like more, considering the inflation, I've lost a significant amount of potential earnings. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure some gain, rather than risk losing everything in further rounds."
