"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair and equal share! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 50-50, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bit more for myself to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to take into account the 10% inflation and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I need to account for the inflation too. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share, especially since I'm losing value at an increasing rate. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
