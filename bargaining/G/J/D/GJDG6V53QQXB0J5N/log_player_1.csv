"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, but we can still both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer in round 1 was more than fair. This is a slight adjustment considering the money is losing value for me each round.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The money may be losing value for you, but I'm not going to give in that easily. This is my new proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While the money is losing value for me, his offers are getting greedier. It's important to remain firm and aim for a fairer deal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not be exploited."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer gives you a good deal and still accounts for the time pressure and inflation working against me.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to a 50/50 split. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the potential earnings decrease for me, so it's important to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. 
* **Fairness:**  While Bob is benefiting from the situation, this offer still provides him with a significant amount of money and is a fairer deal overall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, considering the inflation is affecting you more. This might be your last chance to get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me.  Rejecting this offer risks walking away with even less, or potentially nothing. 
* **Significant Loss:** Waiting any longer could result in Bob offering even less favorable terms, pushing me closer to a point where even a 50/50 split after more inflation would be worse than this offer.
* **Bob's Stance:**  While Bob's offer is far from ideal, his message suggests he may be unwilling to budge further.

This is a tough decision, but the risk of losing significantly more money outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal at this late stage."
