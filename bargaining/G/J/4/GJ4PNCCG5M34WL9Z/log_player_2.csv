"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money evenly to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the most fair division possible, there's no reason to reject it and risk getting less or nothing in subsequent rounds. Accepting ensures a guaranteed $50."
