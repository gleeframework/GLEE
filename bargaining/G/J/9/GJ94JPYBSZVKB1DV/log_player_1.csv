"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's start with a more even split. I'll take $6,000, and you can have $4,000.  This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""That's not a fair deal, Bob! The inflation is working against me, and this offer doesn't reflect that. Let's try for something more balanced in the next round.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation. While it might seem tempting to take $4,000 before it devalues further, holding out for a better deal is crucial in this scenario.  By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of being taken advantage of."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm taking a bigger hit from the inflation with each round.  I'll take $5,500 and you get $4,500. It's a compromise that considers the situation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I've lowered my initial demand slightly but maintained a position that factors in the inflation. This offer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not to the point of accepting a deal that's significantly disadvantageous to me.  The clock is ticking, and this offer puts pressure on Bob to either accept a reasonable compromise or risk the value of the entire deal decreasing further."
