Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less after each round, I'll aim for a bigger share this time.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting this offer.

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll aim for a bigger share to compensate for the loss. However, Alice's offer is close to the original 50-50 split, and I don't want to risk rejecting it and getting a worse deal later.
