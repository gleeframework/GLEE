"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the bigger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see what Alice's future offers will be. I'm not convinced by the ""fairness"" argument, and I'm sure I can negotiate a better deal for myself with a few rounds of play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be practical. I'm offering you a fair share, but I'll take the majority. We both get something, and it's a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob. But, I'm still willing to negotiate. This offer gives you a significant portion while still allowing for a more balanced split. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and this offer is better than the initial one she made.  It's a good compromise considering the inflation factor. I'll take it."
