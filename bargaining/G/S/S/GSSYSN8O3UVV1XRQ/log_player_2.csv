"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. 200,000 is a pretty low starting point, and I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially since there's a chance I can propose a better division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation, and I'm hoping she'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting less in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  Even though the inflation has devalued the money, 450,000 is still a decent amount and it's better than the risk of getting less in the following rounds, especially since the money keeps decreasing in value."
