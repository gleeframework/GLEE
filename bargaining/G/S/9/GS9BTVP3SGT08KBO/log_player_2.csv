"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, the inflation will significantly impact my gains over the next 12 rounds. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly.  Let's try 400k for me, 600k for you.  We both still get a good share, and we avoid the risk of inflation eroding my earnings.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, time is working against you more than me. This offer is a balance between fairness and the reality of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still offering a deal where I get significantly less than her. I'm willing to accept a slightly lower gain, but I'm not willing to take such a large hit with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 375000, ""alice_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split it 375k for me, 625k for you.  This balances the risk of inflation with the need to reach a fair agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm being more than fair, but your greed is making you lose money. Take this offer before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a better deal, inflation is becoming a serious problem.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not a terrible deal compared to what I might get in the remaining rounds."
