"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob.  I think we can both do well if we work together. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is not fair, and I believe we can find a better split. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it in a way that we both get a significant amount. I believe this is a more fair division.""}\n\nI've made an offer that gives me 60% of the money and Alice 40%. I've also included a message explaining that I think this is a more fair division. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer is closer to your proposal, but it still gives me a reasonable share. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer again. Although the offer is closer to my proposal, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to try and get more. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I've decided to make another offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Alice is not willing to give me a larger share. I'll propose a slightly different division and include a message to try and persuade Alice to accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make up for the inflation. This offer is closer to the middle, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.""}"
