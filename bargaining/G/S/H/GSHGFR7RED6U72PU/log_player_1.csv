"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm proposing to take the lion's share, but leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept.  This way, I maximize my potential gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I know that with each round, the value of my share will decrease.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come closer to my initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to reduce my proposed gain slightly to make it more appealing to Bob, while still maintaining a significant advantage for myself.  He rejected my initial offer, but I believe this revised offer will be more tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation is becoming more noticeable. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to budge on his position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk by offering a smaller amount to Bob. However, I need to make a significant move to get him to accept, as inflation is rapidly decreasing the value of my potential gain. Hopefully, this revised offer will be enough to sway him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gain. I need to be more assertive to get a better deal, and I'm going to try to counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to take a more aggressive approach. I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share, but still maintain a significant lead for myself. With inflation at this rate, I need to start securing a deal before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision. Inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, and Bob's offer is still worse than my initial proposal. However, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, the inflation will continue to erode my potential earnings, and we might end up with nothing.  Therefore, I'm going to accept his offer.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do under these circumstances."
