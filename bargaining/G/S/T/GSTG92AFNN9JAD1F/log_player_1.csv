"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $250,000 * 0.8 = $200,000
Bob gain: $750,000 * 0.8 = $600,000

I accept this offer.
