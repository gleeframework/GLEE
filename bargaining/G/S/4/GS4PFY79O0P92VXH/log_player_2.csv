Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is moving in the right direction, but very slowly. It's still early in the game, and conceding now would send the message that I'm willing to accept a less-than-fair deal. I'll hold out for a better offer."

# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure, but she needs to understand I'm serious about a fair split.  Holding out a little longer is risky, but I believe she'll make a better offer in the next round or two."
