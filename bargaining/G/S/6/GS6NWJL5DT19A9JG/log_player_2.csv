Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous Alice.  Another round and we'll both be significantly poorer. Take the deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing even more value, I'm not budging! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, taking the offer is the best course of action, even though it's heavily skewed in Alice's favor. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Shrinking Value:** The 59.04% inflation means Bob is losing a huge chunk of potential earnings with every passing round.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice's message indicates she's unlikely to budge. Waiting for a better offer in future rounds is incredibly risky given the rapid inflation for Bob.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting the current offer, while bad, secures Bob at least some money.  Rejecting it risks getting an even worse offer next round, where the value for Bob will be even lower."
