"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. My message to Bob is a friendly suggestion to start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $60 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $57. And Bob's potential gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $32.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
