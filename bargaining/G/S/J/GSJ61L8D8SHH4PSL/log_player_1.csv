"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can improve from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less now, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
