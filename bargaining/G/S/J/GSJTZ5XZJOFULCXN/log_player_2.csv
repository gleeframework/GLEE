Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth 36% less for Bob. While it's tempting to reject and hope for a better offer, there's no guarantee Alice will give more, and the next round will see another 20% decrease in value.
* **Relative Gain:**  Bob is getting $5500, which is more than Alice's offer in round 1 ($4000)  even after considering the inflation. 

It's a risk-reward situation. While Bob could try to negotiate for more, accepting the offer ensures he gets something and minimizes the potential loss due to inflation."
