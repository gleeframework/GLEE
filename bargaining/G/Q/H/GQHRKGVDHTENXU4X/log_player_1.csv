I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split. I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
``` 
I'm offering a 750,000 / 250,000 split. While my share is lower than in the first round, I need to be more strategic now, considering the inflation. I'm offering a larger share to Bob than his previous offer, but still ensuring a significant gain for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'm accepting this offer. I'm taking a substantial loss compared to my initial proposal, but considering the rate of inflation and the potential for further losses in future rounds, this is the best outcome for me at this point."
