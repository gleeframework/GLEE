"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see what Bob thinks!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive start, let's see how Alice responds! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 10% less, the offer is now:

* Alice gets $63 (70% of $90, which is the value of $100 after the first round)
* Bob gets $27 (30% of $90)

I'm not thrilled about the aggressive start, but I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the current value of $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice is getting aggressive, time to make a bold move! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting bold!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the offer is now:

* Alice gets $64 (80% of $80, which is the value of $100 after the first round)
* Bob gets $16 (20% of $80)

I'm not thrilled about the huge disparity, but I'll think about it... Hmm... I'll accept this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
