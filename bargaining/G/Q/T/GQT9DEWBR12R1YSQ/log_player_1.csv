"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. I'm aiming for a large share in the first round to maximize my potential gains, but I'm still offering Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is better than getting nothing, it is significantly less than what I was initially offered.  I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I am offering Bob $200,000, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still significantly less than his original offer.  I hope to incentivize him to accept while securing a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still losing money due to inflation, this offer is significantly better than the previous one. I need to take this offer to avoid losing even more in future rounds."
