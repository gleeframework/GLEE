"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $8,000 from the first round is now worth less, but I still have the same amount in nominal terms.

I will reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous this time, offering Bob a larger share to increase the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer in the first round. If Bob's gain in round 4 is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, that means his gain in round 4 is 72.9% of his gain in round 1. In round 1, Bob's gain was $2,000. So, in round 4, his gain is 0.729 * $2,000 = $1,458.

However, Bob's offer in round 4 is $8,000. This is more than the $1,458 equivalent value of his gain in the first round. I will reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my previous offer of $7,000 was equivalent to a smaller amount in real terms. I'll try to be more aggressive this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm aiming to take a smaller share, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
