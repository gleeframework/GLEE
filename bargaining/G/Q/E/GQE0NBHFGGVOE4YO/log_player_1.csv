"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept the offer since it's my turn to make a proposal next and I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
