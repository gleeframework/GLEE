Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing more value in the following rounds due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation, and avoids dragging this out any further. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
