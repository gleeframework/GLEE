# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd like to aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less, I'll need an even higher share to make up for it.

I'll reject this offer as well and try to negotiate for an even better deal.

```

I'll reject this offer and try to call Bob's bluff.
