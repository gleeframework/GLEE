"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking a 10% hit from your initial proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give you a free ride. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
