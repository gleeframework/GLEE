"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get more in the future rounds.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount to start, but I'm leaving room for negotiation and future offers."
