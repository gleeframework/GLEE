"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take 60%. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm not giving away too much. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to divide the money.  Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gains are worth even less now.

I'll think about it... A 50/50 split is a good offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. I'll have to decide whether the risk of waiting for a better offer is worth it.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gains are worth 10% less than in the second round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to give you a good deal, Bob. This time, I'll give you 45% of the money, and I'll take 55%. Don't miss out on this offer!""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but I'm still getting a decent amount of money. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a chance to get a better deal than before.  Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 60% of the money. I was hoping for a better deal. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another offer and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
