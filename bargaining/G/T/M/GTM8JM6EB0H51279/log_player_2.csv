"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice, the total value of the money is now $8,000 for me and $9,000 for Alice.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

For me, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, so 10,000 * (1 - 0.36) = 6,400. The offer is 4600, which is 71.56% of the actual value, so the actual amount I would gain is 4600 / 0.7156 = 6427.57.

For Alice, the money is worth 19% less than in the first round, so 10,000 * (1 - 0.19) = 8,100. The offer is 5400, which is 66.67% of the actual value, so the actual amount Alice would gain is 5400 / 0.6667 = 8100.

Considering the actual amounts, my offer is more favorable to me, but I'll consider Alice's offer.
