Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my share should be higher. This is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. We both know time is against me, but this split is fairer than your previous proposal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round weakens your position. This is a one-time chance before I raise my share again. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer results in a better outcome than continuing to play and risking even greater losses."
