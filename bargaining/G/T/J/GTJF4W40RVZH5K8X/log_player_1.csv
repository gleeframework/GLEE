"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best deal for me, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to find a middle ground, let's see if we can meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very careful.

Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept his offer.
