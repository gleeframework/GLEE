"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything in the first round. It's a gamble, but if Bob rejects, he has to make an offer and I get to see his strategy.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to get more, it's clear Bob is willing to be a bit more aggressive.  Accepting this means I get a guaranteed 600,000, and I don't have to risk another round where he might offer me even less.  It's a good compromise given the changing dynamics of the game."
