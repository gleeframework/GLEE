Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking and we both lose if we wait any longer.  Take this offer and let's be done. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot.  Every round that passes makes the deal worse for her.
* **Time Pressure:**  Alice's message indicates a sense of urgency. Delaying further risks her offering even less favorable terms in a future round.
* **Better than Round 3:** This offer is slightly better than what Alice proposed in Round 3.

It's a compromise, but in negotiation, sometimes accepting a decent offer is better than holding out for an ideal one that might never come."
