"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game. This way, we both get $5,000 and can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 6000, you get 4000.  Let's see if you think that's a better deal than an even split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that this is a better deal than the original 50-50 split. Bob is trying to take a larger share, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a reasonable balance. I'm willing to give up some of my share to see if Bob will accept this offer."
