"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to reassess my priorities.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet Bob halfway just yet. I'd like to see if I can negotiate for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to meeting me halfway, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge. Consider this a compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me a slight edge, now it's my turn to counter with a slight edge of my own! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite, I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving Bob a larger share, especially since I was already willing to compromise in the previous round. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll take a slightly smaller share. Can we finally agree on a deal?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. I'm hoping this will be the turning point in the negotiations."

# Bob's message: You're getting closer to meeting me in the middle, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 5% larger share than I offered in the previous round. I'd like to try to negotiate further and find a better balance."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, exactly. Let's split the money 50/50 and end this!""
}
```

I'm making a final attempt to find a mutually beneficial solution. Meeting in the middle seems like a fair and reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
