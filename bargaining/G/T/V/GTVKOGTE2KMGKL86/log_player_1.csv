"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $360,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
