"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'll start with a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor.  While it seems unfair, Bob has the chance to reject and make a counter offer in the next round.  Since inflation will kick in on my side, I'm motivated to secure a decent deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice for me. The inflation will impact my earnings significantly in the next round, making it less likely I'll get a better deal.  It's better to take the 500,000 now, even if it's not ideal."
