"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. Take a small slice now, and we'll both be happier in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to take the easy 1000, I'm going to gamble on getting a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""It's your turn to be practical, Alice. Let's split this fairly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  We both lose more with each passing round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a bigger share, this is a reasonable offer considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we continue."
