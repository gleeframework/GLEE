"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can see how the game plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leave some for you 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that I can do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need some for myself. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, you're getting a small share 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $1,000, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $1,000 and hope that Bob is happy with his $9,000."
