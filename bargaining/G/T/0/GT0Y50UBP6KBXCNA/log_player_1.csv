"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain remains the same as in the first round, I'm not inclined to accept a lower share for myself. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to myself, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Bob's offer is very similar to mine in the previous round, but with a slightly higher share for himself. Given the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll consider this offer carefully.

Since my gain remains the same as in the first round, I'm willing to accept a slightly lower share for myself, especially considering the increasing inflation rate. I'll accept this offer.
