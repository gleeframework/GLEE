"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less for me, so I'm looking for a slightly better deal. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me, I'll make a new offer""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting hard! My gain is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 3500, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
