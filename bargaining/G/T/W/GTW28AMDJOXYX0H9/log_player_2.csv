"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is still good for me, and gives you a chance to walk away with something. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is hurting me much faster than her. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain due to the decreasing value of the money. I need to incentivize Alice to make a deal sooner rather than later."
