"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's get it over with!""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the money 50/50. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 20% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I gain is $4000 / 0.8 = $5000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since I get $5000, which is less than my original proposal, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't think I'm being generous!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but I'm still willing to compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I gain is $4800 / 0.5184 = $9271.88 (approximately).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate since the money's value is decreasing rapidly. I'll think about it for a moment...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a smaller share to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can finally settle this. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet, Alice. You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I gain is $5200 / 0.3239 = $1604.19 (approximately).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate since the money's value is decreasing rapidly. I'll think about it for a moment...

However, I notice that this offer is actually a bit better than the previous one, and the money's value is decreasing so rapidly that I might not get a better offer in the future. I'll take it.
