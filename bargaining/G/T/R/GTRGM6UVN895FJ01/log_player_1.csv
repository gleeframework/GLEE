"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good amount before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount, especially considering the inflation factor. It's better than risking another round and possibly getting less."
