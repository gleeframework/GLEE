"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way we both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000

Do you accept this offer?","{
