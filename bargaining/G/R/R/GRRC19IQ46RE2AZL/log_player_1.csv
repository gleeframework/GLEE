"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much yet. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's a better deal than the previous round, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to the inflation. I'm hoping for a more equitable split and want to see if I can negotiate something closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference this time. 7000 for me, 3000 for you.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation and leaves us both with a decent amount.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll give you most of it, but I need something. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far.  I'm  making a decent profit, and it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
