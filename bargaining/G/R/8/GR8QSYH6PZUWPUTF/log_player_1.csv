"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amount I'd gain is $64 (80% of $80). Bob's offer is still for $50, which is worth the same as before, but now it's 50% of the remaining $80.

I'll reject this offer because I'd be getting less than I would have if I accepted my original offer in Round 1.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80%), I'll propose a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining money, which is a slightly more aggressive offer than before."
