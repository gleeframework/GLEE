I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping to secure a good deal early on, as the value of the money could decrease with each round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of further inflation means I could end up with nothing if I keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I'm happy to secure it."
