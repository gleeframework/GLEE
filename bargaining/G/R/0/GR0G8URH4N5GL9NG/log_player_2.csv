"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. I'm willing to adjust my initial proposal slightly to reach a compromise. This offer reflects a more balanced split considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the rapidly devaluing money for her. While her offer is closer to the middle, waiting her out is advantageous for Bob. Each round, the value diminishes more for Alice, making her more likely to accept a deal more favorable to Bob."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice, and the value is dropping fast. This is a fair split - let's wrap this up and get our money's worth.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** Bob needs to start increasing pressure on Alice.  Mentioning the shrinking value is crucial to make her consider the consequences of stalling.
* **Slight Concession:** The offer is slightly lower than Bob's round 2 offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but not by much. This keeps the pressure on Alice. 
* **Goal:** The target is to secure a deal where Bob gets a slight majority.  Given the faster devaluation for Alice, she might be more willing to accept a less favorable deal as time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close.  This offer is a very slight advantage to me acknowledging the inflation working against me, but still gives you a significant amount. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the heat. She's acknowledged the inflation working against her and offered Bob a slight majority. However, Bob is in a strong position. With each passing round, Alice loses significantly more, making her increasingly desperate for a deal. Holding out for a better offer in the next round is a calculated risk worth taking."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. However, time is really hurting the value of this money, especially for you. I'm standing firm on this offer - it's a good deal for both of us considering we're running out of rounds.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's time to show Alice that Bob is serious.  Repeating a previous offer with a message emphasizing its fairness and the time pressure reinforces Bob's position.
* **Calculated Risk:** Alice is likely feeling the pressure now. By standing firm, Bob risks her rejecting the offer, but the potential gain from a better deal in later rounds outweighs the risk of losing a small amount in this round.
* **Finality:** The message implies this is Bob's final offer, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.  The goal is to make her realize that further stalling might result in an even worse outcome for her."
