"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'll reject the offer because I'd rather have more money in the long run, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round.

```

}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more skewed towards me to account for the decreasing value of the money over time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best deal I'll get.
