"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'll still give you a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a lower share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go easy on you""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35/65 split, trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself."
