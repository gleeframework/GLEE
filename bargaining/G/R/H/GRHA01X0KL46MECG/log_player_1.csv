"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but let's start with a more balanced split. We can adjust in the next rounds if needed. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer... I'd like to get a bit more, but I don't want to reject his offer and risk getting an even worse deal later. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
