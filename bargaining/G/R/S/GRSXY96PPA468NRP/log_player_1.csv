Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is rapidly losing value. Waiting any longer significantly reduces the overall payout for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate in hopes of getting a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair. While I aimed for a higher share initially, accepting this offer ensures we both benefit."
