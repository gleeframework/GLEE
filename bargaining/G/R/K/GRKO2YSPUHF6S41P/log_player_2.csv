Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but time is working against us. I'm proposing a slightly better offer for you than what you'd get if you rejected this and we went to round 4.  Let's be sensible and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
