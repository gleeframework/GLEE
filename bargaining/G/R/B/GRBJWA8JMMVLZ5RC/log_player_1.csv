"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $40 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $32 in the first round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
