Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split, Alice. This is more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 630000,
""bob_gain"": 370000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob.  This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** It's important to emphasize the time pressure on Bob. His potential gains are shrinking faster than Alice's (20% per round vs. 10%).
* **Finality:**  By stating it's a final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept a deal now, before his position weakens further.
* **Slightly Improved Offer:** This offer is slightly better for Bob than my first offer, showing some flexibility but also making it clear I'm not going to be pushed around."
