"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose a 990,000:10,000 split. This is a relatively fair split in my opinion, allowing Bob a small but significant gain while ensuring I receive the majority.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the 5% inflation makes this offer a decent compromise. Accepting ensures I get something, rather than risking further losses with another round."
