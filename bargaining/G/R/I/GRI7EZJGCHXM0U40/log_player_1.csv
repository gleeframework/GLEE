Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation rate is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, even with the decreased value. It's better than risking further rounds and potential losses."
