"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a smaller share, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  It's the most reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about splitting it evenly. I'd like to try to get a bit more.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money and gives me a slightly larger share."
