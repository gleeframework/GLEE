"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start by being generous to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent chunk of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my first offer, and while I understand the value of the money is decreasing, I'm not going to accept a proposal that leaves me with so little. I believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping to reach a compromise.  While the money is losing value, I'm still aiming for a fair split that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still not a good deal for me. The inflation has hurt his offer significantly, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share again, hoping to reach a compromise. While the inflation is impacting the value of the money, I'm still confident I can secure a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky, as we're both losing significant value with each round. While this isn't my ideal split,  the inflation is pushing us towards a point where we'll get nothing if we continue. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid that outcome."
