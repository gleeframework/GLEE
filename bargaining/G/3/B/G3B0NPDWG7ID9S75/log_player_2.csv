"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 into $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This offers a fair split considering the risk of inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Even though the offer is a 60/40 split, Bob's share is subject to a higher inflation rate (10%) than Alice's (5%).  This means the value of Bob's $4000 will decrease more rapidly than Alice's $6000 in future rounds. 

By rejecting, Bob can leverage the inflation differential and potentially get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
