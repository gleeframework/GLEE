Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not fair at all. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 75/25 split in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
