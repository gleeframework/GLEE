Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't wait for it to get worse! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly using the threat of inflation against me. However, even with the decreasing value, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than 50% is a bad move in the long run.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice might become, potentially offering a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose if this drags on.  This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Inflation is hurting me more than Alice. I need to apply pressure to settle.
* **Finality:**  By stating it's my final offer, I signal I'm unwilling to go much lower. This might push Alice to accept rather than risk an even worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Slight Edge:** Offering slightly more than half acknowledges the inflation factor but still aims for a reasonable advantage for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one last chance. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to budge further, especially after calling my bluff on the ""final offer.""  Continuing the game is too risky now. While 440,000 is significantly less than what I aimed for, it's better than risking even further losses to inflation in future rounds, where Alice might offer even less."
