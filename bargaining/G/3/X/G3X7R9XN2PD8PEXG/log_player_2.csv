"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split considering the inflation rates.  Let's finish this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be more to compensate for the smaller depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is worse than my previous offer, I think it's better to accept it now and avoid further inflation. It's not a great deal, but it's better than risking losing more money in the next round."
