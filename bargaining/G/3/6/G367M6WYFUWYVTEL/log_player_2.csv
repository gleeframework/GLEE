"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get more than 50%. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more since the money is worth less to me with each round. This way, we both still get a decent amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I think we should get closer to a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the money is worth 19% less to me now, I still think I can get a better deal. Alice's offer of 45 is less than what I offered her in the previous round, so I'm willing to take another risk to see if I can get closer to 50% or more. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. This offer is still relatively fair, and we both get a good amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This inflation is getting out of hand! Let's just split it evenly again before we lose too much. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, with the money now being worth 34.39% less to me than in the first round, I think it's wise to accept the 50/50 split offer from Alice. This way, I still get a substantial amount, and further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for me, potentially leading to a worse outcome. Accepting this offer seems like the best decision under the current circumstances."
