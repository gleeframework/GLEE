# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more strategic. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer for now. My goal is to get a better deal, and I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get. I'll wait for a better opportunity.
