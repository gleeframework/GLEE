**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, while time is working against me more than her.  I need to signal I'm willing to let the deal fall apart to get her to make a serious move."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. 50/50 is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

By now, it's clear Alice is willing to play hardball. Offering anything less than a 50/50 split at this stage risks losing everything as the remaining rounds tick down. This strong stance might be enough to make her reconsider her position, especially with the increasing inflation working against both of us."
