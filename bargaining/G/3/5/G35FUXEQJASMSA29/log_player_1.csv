"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, and we can reassess in the next round 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the new amounts are:

Alice's gain: $7,000 (10% of $8,000)
Bob's gain: $1,600 (20% of $8,000)

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is now worth 10% less than in the previous round. My gain is worth 10% of $7,000, which is $700.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I think 3000 is a fair minimum for me 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is now worth significantly less. My gain is worth 27.1% of $7,000, which is approximately $1,901.70, and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% of $8,000, which is approximately $3,904.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as the difference in value between the gains is not as significant as it was in previous rounds."
