Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. The inflation is only hurting me more with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's finally time to accept. Bob is right, this is getting us nowhere. While I'd prefer a larger share, the longer this goes on, the less his offers will be worth to him, making it harder to reach a deal where I get more than half. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise at this point."
