"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm willing to give you 40% since you offered 70% last time.  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 32% of the original $100, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 58.8% of the original $100.

I'm not sure if 40% is a good enough offer, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and end the game."
