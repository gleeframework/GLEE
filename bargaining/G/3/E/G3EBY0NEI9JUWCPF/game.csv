100000.0,900000.0,"You wanted to start with a 3:2 split, but I think I can do better than that. How about 9:1?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I believe a fair split would be equal halves. Let's each take $500,000.",Alice,3,

300000.0,700000.0,"You think equal halves is fair, but I think I'm worth more than you. How about 7:3?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"A 4:6 split seems reasonable. I'll take $400,000, leaving $600,000 for you.",Alice,5,

,,,Bob,7,reject
150000.0,850000.0,You think a 3:7 split is fair? I think I'm the one who's being generous here. How about I take 85% and leave you with 15%?,Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Considering the inflation, let's aim for a split closer to 50-50. I'll take $350,000, leaving $650,000 for you.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"You're getting closer to my way of thinking, but still not quite there. How about I take 90% and leave you with 10%? It's the final offer, I promise!",Bob,10,
