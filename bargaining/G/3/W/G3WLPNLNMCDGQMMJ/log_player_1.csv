"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good start.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering we both get something close to half. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better act quickly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
