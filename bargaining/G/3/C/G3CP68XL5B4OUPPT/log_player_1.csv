This offer gives me 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%.  I'm starting with a strong offer, hoping to get the game over quickly before inflation hurts my share.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation taken into account.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his last offer, but still keeping a majority of the money for myself.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to give up too much.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to make sure I get a good deal before it gets any worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is better than what I would get if I rejected and made an offer myself.  I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, so it's time to take what I can get."
