"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going for a slightly aggressive opening offer. I figure I can get a good chunk of the money upfront before inflation starts to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even with inflation. I'm going to reject and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that if we keep rejecting each other, the money will be worth less and less for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob gain: 80

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to secure a good portion of the money. It's clear that Bob is being stubborn, but I'm hoping to find a compromise before we both lose too much due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than my initial proposal, it's still not acceptable.  The inflation is getting significant, but I'm still holding out for a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and avoiding a complete loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer isn't great, the inflation is starting to really hurt. It's better to accept something than risk getting nothing at all."
