"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will agree and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less now, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I don't want to give up 50% of the remaining money, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
