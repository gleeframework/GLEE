"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Your split was a bit unfair to me. How about we try something closer to the middle this time?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** It's crucial to reach a deal quickly.  A 20% decrease in value for Bob each round makes waiting costly.
* **Fairness:**  Alice's initial offer heavily favored her.  Offering a slightly more even split (but still advantageous to Bob) might entice her to accept. 
* **Urgency:** The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable outcome in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as close to the middle as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is really starting to bite into Bob's potential gains. Waiting another round could cost him significantly more.
* **Alice's Concessions:** While not ideal, Alice has moved slightly closer to a more balanced split. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal in a future round is very risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and the value of the money will continue to decrease."
