Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. It's way too lopsided in Alice's favor, and I have 11 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This seems like a fair starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects."
