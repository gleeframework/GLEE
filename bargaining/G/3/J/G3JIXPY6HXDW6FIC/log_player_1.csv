Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think we can both do better. My offer reflects the slight inflation difference, but also allows for a more equal split. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
