"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game finished quickly.  I figure I can get most of the money, and with the inflation, even a small amount for Bob might be enticing enough. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's offering me a larger portion than I offered him, I'm aware of the inflation affecting him, which means his offer is actually less valuable to him than my initial offer was to me. I'm going to see if I can leverage that and get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than in Round 1. I know that the inflation is hurting him, but I'm hoping that he'll still accept this offer because he's likely to be losing more with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting a bigger share than the last offer, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's offer, making it even less attractive to me than my own offer from Round 3. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm going to do it in smaller increments than before.  The inflation is hitting Bob harder with each round, so I'm hoping he'll start to see the value in taking what he can get before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's the biggest share I've been offered yet, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of his offer to him.  I'm confident that I can still get a better deal for myself, especially since we're getting closer to the end of the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to continue lowering my offer, but I'm going to do it in smaller increments than before. The inflation is hitting Bob harder with each round, so I'm hoping he'll start to see the value in taking what he can get before it's too late.  I'm trying to find the sweet spot where he's more likely to accept the offer, but it's getting riskier with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's the biggest share I've been offered yet, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of his offer to him. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal for myself, especially since we're getting closer to the end of the game and the stakes are getting higher.  I'm willing to risk it for a bigger share of the pie."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob an equal split of the money.  The inflation is hitting him really hard now, and I think he might be desperate enough to accept a 50/50 split.  It's a risky move, but I'm willing to take the chance. If he rejects this offer, we are getting dangerously close to the end of the game and both of us could end up with nothing."
