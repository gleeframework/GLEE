"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. While I acknowledge your initial proposal, I believe this offer reflects a fairer distribution given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
