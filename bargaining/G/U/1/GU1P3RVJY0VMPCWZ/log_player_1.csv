"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you get 40. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm aiming for a fair split in the first round, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll receive 80% of the amount I would have received in the first round. In this case, that would be 60 * 0.8 = 48.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about meeting in the middle, I'd like to aim higher. I'll pass on this offer and make a counteroffer next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the second round, so I'll receive 80% of the amount I would have received in the second round. In this case, that would be 48 * 0.8 = 38.4.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 55 for me and 45 for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 48 is still too much. Let's try 52 for me and 48 for you. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll receive 51.2% of the amount I would have received in the first round. In this case, that would be 60 * 0.512 = 30.72.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think 48 for me is a good compromise, considering the inflation. I'll take it.""
}
```"
