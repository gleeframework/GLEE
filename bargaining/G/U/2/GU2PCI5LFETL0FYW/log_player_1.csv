Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself.

# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's wrap this up before inflation eats away at the value any further for both of us.
