"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```
Here's why I reject:

* **Unfavorable Split:** Alice's offer gives her a significantly larger share. 
* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on my side. The longer the game goes on, the more our perceived values of the money will diverge in my favor.

While Alice's message appeals to reason, the actual offer isn't reasonable from my perspective. I'm willing to gamble that I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more equitable split. This offer still gives you a good chunk.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Advantage:** The value of the money has already decreased, making Alice's initial offer less appealing.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm not going for an extreme offer right away, which might antagonize Alice. This offer is a significant improvement for me while still being potentially acceptable to her.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and explains the reasoning behind my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is working in her favor. However, her offer is getting worse for me, not better! While the decreasing value of the money is a factor, accepting an even smaller share now would be a significant loss. 

I'm willing to bet Alice doesn't want to drag this out too long either, as she's also losing value.  Holding out for a better offer in the next round is still the best strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Let's wrap this up before inflation eats away at the value any further for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both of our gains are being significantly impacted by inflation now.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that waiting longer is detrimental to both of us.
* **Strategic Retreat:**  While not ideal, this offer is a concession from my previous position. It shows I'm willing to negotiate under the pressure of inflation.

This offer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. If she's rational, she'll recognize that this is a reasonable deal considering the circumstances."
