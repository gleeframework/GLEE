"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for my turn to make a proposal. With the inflation rates, it's better for me to delay and try to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more balanced offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is affecting us both, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation rates and the fact that Alice's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I think this is a reasonable offer. Further delay would only decrease the value of the money for both of us, but more significantly for Alice. This offer seems like a good compromise."
