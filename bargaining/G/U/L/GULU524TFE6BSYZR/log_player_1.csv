"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $1,000,000, and I'll take 60%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since the money is worth less to you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

However, I'm not convinced by his argument, and I think his offer is still a bit too generous to him. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer 55-45 in favor of Bob.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation!

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the value. 55-45 is the best I can do.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and not giving away too much value. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
