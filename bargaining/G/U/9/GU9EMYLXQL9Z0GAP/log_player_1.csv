"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but still leaves something for Bob. I hope he accepts it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though I lose a large portion of my potential gain due to inflation, it's still better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round."
