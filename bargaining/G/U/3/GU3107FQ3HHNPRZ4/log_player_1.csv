"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose that Alice receives $90 and Bob receives $10. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob something.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more than $50, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the later rounds.  Bob is being very fair here, and I'd be foolish to reject this offer."
