"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my offer would have been 63 and 37, which is a better deal for me. But Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
