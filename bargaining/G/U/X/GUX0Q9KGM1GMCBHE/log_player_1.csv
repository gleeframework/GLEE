"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a fair and simple split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you get 40. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time around. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
