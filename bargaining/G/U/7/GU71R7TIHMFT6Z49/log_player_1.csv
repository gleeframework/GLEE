Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's split it 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob receives 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering we both have to deal with inflation, but we can negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 40-60 is a good deal for me, considering I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
