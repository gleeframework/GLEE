"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money while still offering Bob a small amount. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's better than nothing in the event of failure.  However, I am aware that inflation will reduce the value of the money in future rounds, so I'm not being overly greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.  While his offer is tempting, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me, especially since inflation will continue to erode the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, hoping that Bob will see it's in his best interest to accept. We're both losing value due to inflation, but I'm trying to find a balance where we both get something. This offer is still favorable to me, especially considering the inflation rate, and I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the urgency of reaching an agreement before we both lose more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take the lion's share, but he's starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  While his offer is tempting, I know that I can do better. If I reject this offer, I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate more in the next round. I'm sticking to my strategy of trying to get a fair share of the money, and I'm not going to let Bob exploit the inflation to his advantage."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but this time I'm pushing closer to a 70/30 split. The inflation is hitting us both hard, and I need to ensure I get a fair share. Bob may be tempted to accept, as this offer is much better than the previous one. However, I'm prepared to continue the negotiation if he rejects.  I'm confident that my consistent, but moderate, concessions are demonstrating my willingness to compromise while ensuring my long-term gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get a better deal, but I'm not going to give in.  Inflation is biting into our earnings, but I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I hold out. His offer is getting closer to what I consider fair, but I'm not willing to accept yet. I'm going to stick with my strategy of gradual concessions, aiming for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is the point where we're both facing the real consequences of inflation.  I'm reducing my share again, making it a 60/40 split in my favor. This should demonstrate that I'm committed to finding a compromise.  I'm also getting closer to a more balanced split, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting, especially considering how much we've both lost to inflation."
