"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%. My message to Bob is that I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, a 3:2 split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll get 90% of $400,000, which is $360,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 3:2 split is a significant concession from his initial 4:1 offer, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll decide to accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
