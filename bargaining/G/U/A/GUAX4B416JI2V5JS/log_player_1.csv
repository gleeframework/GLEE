"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but don't expect me to give away all the money!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which seems reasonable given that I'll be the one making the first offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it down the middle, but I'm not getting any less than that! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, but I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
