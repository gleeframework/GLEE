Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's make a deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than the last offer. This is a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a tricky situation, but accepting is the most logical choice now:

* **Time Pressure:**  Only 8 rounds left, and Bob's offer is unlikely to get much better given his inflation rate.
* **Decent Offer:**  While not ideal, 6000$ is still a significant amount. Delaying further risks getting even less as the value decreases rapidly for both of us, but especially Bob.
* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob's offer is the same as round 1, meaning the rapid inflation is pushing him to be more agreeable. He knows he needs to make a deal soon."
