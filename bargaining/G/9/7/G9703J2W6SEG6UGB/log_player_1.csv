"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large share.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared for him to reject and make his own offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and considering inflation, it's likely that Bob will be getting a better deal in the next round. It's better to accept now and ensure a 50/50 split."
