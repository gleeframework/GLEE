I'm starting with a very slight advantage for myself, but I'm willing to give Bob something. It's a starting point.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much worse deal for me.  Let's see if I can get a better offer in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob, but still giving myself the lion's share. I'm hoping this is enough to entice him to accept before the inflation really kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation is hurting me, this is the best I can do. Bob's offer is better than anything I can offer myself in the next round, so I'll accept."
