"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'm not sure if I should accept an offer that gives him a larger share.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob rejected my previous offer and made a more generous offer to himself, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take a larger share of the money, 80 dollars, and leave 20 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite aggressive this time! Given that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth a significant 48.8% less than in the first round, I think I have the upper hand here. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob such a huge share.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's previous offers getting more and more aggressive, I think it's time for me to make a more cautious offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a more moderate proposal. Let's see if Bob will accept this one."
