"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fairly aggressive offer, but it's important to establish a strong initial position to counter any potential inflation disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 80/20.  While I still want to prioritize getting a good share, I need to be more reasonable to avoid further rejections and potential losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, and the inflation is starting to take a toll.  I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially with the reduced value of my share. I'll continue to negotiate for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 75/25. The inflation is becoming more significant, and I need to find a compromise to secure at least some of the money before the value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and the inflation is hurting my share. I'm not willing to accept a 20/80 split, especially with the significant value loss. I'll keep trying to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 70/30, hoping to find a middle ground. With each round, the inflation is making my share less valuable, so I need to reach a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very bad offer, especially considering the inflation. While I understand I need to secure something, accepting this would result in a very small share, significantly less than what I had initially proposed. I'll keep negotiating, although time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 65/35. This is a significant concession due to the inflation and the dwindling rounds. I'm hoping that Bob will see the need to compromise to avoid a complete loss of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is very bad for me and is completely unacceptable, even with the high inflation.  I refuse to accept such a small share, especially since I was willing to concede a lot in the previous rounds. I will continue to negotiate even though the time is very limited now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is my last offer.  I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split, even with the high inflation. Time is running out, and we both risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer, even with the high inflation, and it's far worse than the previous rounds. Accepting this would give me a negligible share, and it wouldn't be worth the time and effort spent negotiating.  I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such an unfair deal."
