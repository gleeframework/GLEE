While it seems like a fair offer at first glance, the inflation heavily favors Alice in later rounds. I need to aim for a better initial split."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on me, I'm making a compromise 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is slightly better than her first, but still heavily favors her in the long run due to the faster inflation on her end. I need to push for a more significant advantage while there's still a decent amount of value left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this quickly. This offer gives you a reasonable share considering the rapid devaluation you're facing.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me more, but I'm willing to meet in the middle to end this 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and Alice is finally willing to split evenly. While I aimed for a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable amount rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
