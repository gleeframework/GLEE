"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple solution""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair and straightforward proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less than 50/50 split, but still a generous offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the 3:7 split, and I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""A slightly better split, still generous to you, but more balanced""}

I'm proposing a 42:58 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still a generous offer to Bob. I hope this one will be more acceptable to him!"
