"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer. I'll keep 90$ for myself and give 10$ to Bob.  Let's see if he accepts or tries to get a better deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I'm losing 20% of the value of the money I would gain, I still think I can do better than just 10$. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll offer 80$ for myself and 20$ for Bob. This keeps a larger portion of the money for me, but still offers Bob something.  Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for me than the previous round."
