"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next.  It's better to try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the changing value of the money.  Let's agree and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle. A 60/40 split feels more fair given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's accept this offer. We've gotten a better deal than the first round, and it's more than likely that Alice will keep rejecting offers and we'll end up with nothing."
