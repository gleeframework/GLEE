"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 6:4 split is a more equitable distribution, considering the risk of inflation.  Let's end this round and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
