"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a split that accounts for the decreasing value. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value quickly for me (Bob). It's crucial to secure a reasonable amount now.
* **Round 1 Rejection:**  Alice's offer significantly favored her, showing a willingness to push for a larger share. 
* **Strategic Offer:** This offer is still tilted in my favor to counter the inflation effect, but it's more reasonable than Alice's initial proposal. It might incentivize her to accept rather than risk further losses in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first, it's still significantly skewed in her favor, even considering the inflation. 
* **Time Pressure:** The inflation is hurting me more than Alice. Each round makes the potential gains less appealing.  Delaying further plays into her hands.
* **Possible Counter:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a more equitable split. Alice might be more generous in the next round to avoid walking away with nothing."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this. A 50/50 split is the most sensible solution at this point.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The value of the money is rapidly declining. Prolonging the negotiation only hurts both of us.
* **Signaling Fairness:**  By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This can encourage Alice to accept.
* **Preventing Losses:**  Further rounds risk Alice getting more entrenched in her position.  A clean split now ensures we both walk away with something substantial, even considering the inflation."
