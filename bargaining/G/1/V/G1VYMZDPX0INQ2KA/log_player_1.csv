"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a bit more for myself in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I propose 65/35 in my favor.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 65/35 split, especially since I'm bearing the brunt of the inflation (20% less for me). I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000$ and keeping 420,000$ for myself, trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and being reasonable."
