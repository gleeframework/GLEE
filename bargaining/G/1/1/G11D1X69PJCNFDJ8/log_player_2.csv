Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:**  The money I receive is now worth 36% less than in round 1. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  She's offering an even split.
* **My Perspective:**  While I'd prefer more,  an even split is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal in the next round."
