"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. I'm trying to start with a fair split to see if Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $450,000
* Bob gain: $550,000

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, especially since I was willing to offer a 80/20 split in the first round. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle with a 70/30 split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, and I think a 70/30 split is a reasonable compromise."
