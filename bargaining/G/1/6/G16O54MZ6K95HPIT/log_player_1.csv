"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}

I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  This seems fair considering I have the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred my original proposal, the inflation means that Bob's offer is actually slightly better for me in terms of real value.  I'll take it!"
