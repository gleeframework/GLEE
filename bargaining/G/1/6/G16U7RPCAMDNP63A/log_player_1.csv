"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a good deal for me, since my gain is worth the same as in the previous round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
