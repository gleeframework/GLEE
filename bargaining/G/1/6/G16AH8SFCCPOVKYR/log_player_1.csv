Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed working against me, but I'd rather take the risk than accept an unfair deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob's perception of value is diminishing rapidly. While he sees 58 as a win, its actual worth to him is significantly less than in earlier rounds.
* **Future Uncertainty:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in the next round. Bob's desperation might lead to even more imbalanced proposals.
* **""Bird in Hand"":** 42 is a reasonable amount, and it's better to secure that now than risk ending up with a worse outcome later due to Bob's skewed perception of value."
