"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80%. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, and Bob gets a small amount to keep him interested in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose we split the money evenly. It's a simple and straightforward deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 16% less than in the first round, making it even more tempting to accept a deal.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value in my potential gains."
