"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to 8500, given the inflation.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is still a good deal for him, especially since he just rejected a much more favorable offer from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although my share is much lower, it's better than getting nothing in the next round due to inflation."
