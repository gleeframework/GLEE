"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money (9000$), while still giving Bob a small amount (1000$).  I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer that he'll accept, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor and want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, given the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to split evenly, this is a decent offer. Accepting means I get half the money, which is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
