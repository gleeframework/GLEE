"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my share of $6,000 is now worth $5,700.

I'm not sure I like this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk waiting for the next round, so I'll accept this offer.
