"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect the money's value over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $100,000 in the first round is now worth $80,000 in this round, and Bob's gain of $900,000 is now worth $855,000.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer is now worth 20% less than in the previous round. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was $900,000, I'll offer him $720,000 this time, and keep $280,000 for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 280000,
  ""bob_gain"": 720000
}
```"
