I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping for a quick agreement.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I offered him in the first round, even after accounting for inflation. I'm confident I can do better, especially since his inflation rate is lower than mine.  Let's see if he'll budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 600,000 for myself, while still giving Bob 400,000.  This is a more realistic compromise considering the inflation, and hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

After taking inflation into account, Bob's offer is the best I've seen yet. Although I would have liked a slightly higher share, it's time to secure something before the inflation becomes even more severe. I'll take the 500,000 and hope for the best!"
