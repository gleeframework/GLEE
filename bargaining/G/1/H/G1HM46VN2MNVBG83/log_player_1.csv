"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a very small portion of the money. I want to see if he's willing to accept anything at all, or if he's going to hold out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take even a small amount of money, I think I can do better in the future rounds. It's clear that Bob wants to take the lion's share, and I'm not going to let him get away with it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer an even split this time. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
