I'm going to be greedy in the first round and take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept quickly, as he'll lose a significant amount if he rejects and we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd like to hold out for more, the inflation will drastically reduce the value of any future gains.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sizable chunk of the money, and it's likely better than any potential future deal considering the risk of inflation."
