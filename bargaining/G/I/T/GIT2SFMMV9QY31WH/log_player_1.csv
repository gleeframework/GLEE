"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with $8,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer of meeting in the middle, I'll have to decide whether to accept it. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, Bob. Can you offer me 5500?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and offer me a slightly higher amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount, but still try to get a decent share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's see if we can finalize this.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations even further.

Considering Bob's offer of meeting in the middle again, I'll have to decide whether to accept it. Since the money is worth significantly less, I'd like to try to get a bit more.

However, I also don't want to push Bob too hard, as he's already offered me a decent amount. I'll make a counteroffer that's close to his offer, but slightly more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, Bob. Can you offer me 4200?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and offer me a slightly higher amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

In this round, I'll make a more aggressive offer, trying to get a larger share of the reduced amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, Bob. This is my last offer.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a relatively high share of the remaining money. If he rejects it, I'm not sure what will happen next!"
