"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the first to make an offer.  This is a reasonable starting point,  and leaves room for negotiation if Bob chooses to reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  accepting a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  The inflation penalty would make rejecting and proposing a new split risky, as there's no guarantee Bob would accept my counter-offer."
