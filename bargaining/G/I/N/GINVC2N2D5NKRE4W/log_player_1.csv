"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

With the offer from Bob, I'll get $600,000, which is 80% of $750,000 (the amount I would have gotten in the first round if the offer had been made then). This is a better deal than my original offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% of its original value (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 576000,
  ""bob_gain"": 424000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money I would get in this offer, taking into account the cumulative inflation. 

In the first round, I would have gotten $700,000. In the second round, I would have gotten 80% of that, which is $560,000. In the third round, I would have gotten 64% of that, which is $357,440. In the fourth round, I would get 51.2% of that, which is $182,691.20.

Comparing this to Bob's offer, I would get $550,000, which is worth more than $182,691.20. This is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
