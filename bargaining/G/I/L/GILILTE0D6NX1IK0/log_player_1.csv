# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I would only get $2,000, which is a significant decrease from my original proposal. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a better outcome."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 45-55 is a fair split.""}

Round 4

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I would only get $3,000, which is a significant decrease from my original proposal. Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less than before, I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, I'll take a very small share if it means I get something 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I would only get $1,000, which is an extremely low amount considering the original $10,000. With the inflation, the money is already worth much less, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 50-50, let's end this and walk away with something.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the dispute."
