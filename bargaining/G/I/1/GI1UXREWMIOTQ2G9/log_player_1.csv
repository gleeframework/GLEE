"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60:40 is a fairer split considering the inflation. It's not a bad starting point, let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
