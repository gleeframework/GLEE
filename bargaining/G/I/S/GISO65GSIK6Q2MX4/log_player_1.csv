Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split. This accounts for the time value of money, as I'm taking on more risk by delaying my share. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
