"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous start while acknowledging the need for a deal that Bob might accept.  The clock is ticking, and I want to avoid getting nothing due to the inflation mechanism."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share Alice, but I need a bit more than that. How about we meet closer to the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is inching closer, but I think I can still get a better deal.  The 5% inflation is working in my favor, making him a bit more desperate with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6250,
""bob_gain"": 3750,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, literally! This is my final offer in this range. Take it or I'll have to aim even higher in the next round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** I'm increasing the pressure on Bob by presenting this as my ""final offer"" in this range. This might nudge him towards accepting.
* **Inflation:**  The value of the pot decreases more for me than for him with each round. It's in my best interest to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Calculated Risk:**  I'm increasing my demand slightly from my initial offer, but it's still within a range that might be acceptable to Bob, especially considering the time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting lower. I'm willing to be flexible, but this needs to be a bit more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 5750 
# Bob gain: 4250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Momentum:** Bob is now countering with increases, not decreases. This signals a potential shift in the negotiation where he might start becoming more willing to settle.
* **Inflation:** The 14.26% inflation sting is starting to hurt. While tempting to push further, the potential gains might not outweigh the losses incurred from another round of inflation.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While not my ideal outcome,  5750 is still a significant portion of the pot. Accepting now guarantees a decent gain, avoiding the risk of walking away with nothing if negotiations completely stall."
