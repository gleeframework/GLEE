"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll start lower, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to drive a hard bargain!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $180,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $640,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the significant difference in the amounts. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3.

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value for me (10% less than in Round 2) and 80% of its original value for Bob (20% less than in Round 2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! A fair split for both of us.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 45%. This should be a more balanced offer, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice. I'll give you a bit more, but I need more too! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 70.9% of the original amount, which is $709,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth 70% of the original amount, which is $700,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the significant difference in the amounts. However, I don't want to risk going to Round 5, so I'll have to think carefully...
