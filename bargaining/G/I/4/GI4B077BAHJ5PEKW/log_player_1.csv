"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a chance to get something 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is less appealing, but I still need to think strategically.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 20-80, I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer. I'll aim for a 50-50 split, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no need for more haggling""
}
```"
