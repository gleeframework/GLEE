I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to tempt Bob into accepting.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 5000 is a lot, it's still less than what I was aiming for in the first round. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a bit less than he offered me in the previous round, but still a significant amount.  I'm hoping he'll realize that the money will continue to depreciate and accept this offer before we lose even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me less than what he offered in the previous round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  We've both been pretty stubborn so far.  I think this is the most fair offer we can make, and the inflation is only going to get worse.  Let's see if Bob finally agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more greedy! I'm going to reject this offer.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting, but I'm hoping I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than I was in the previous round, hoping that the looming inflation will finally make him accept.  The value of the money is rapidly declining, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
