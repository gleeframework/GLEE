"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  This is a fair deal for both of us,  let's split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing everything.  This is a decent offer, considering the inflation."
