Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I get 9000 and Bob gets 1000.  Let's start with a fair division, and I'll give Bob a little bit to make him happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. It's not fair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'll take 8000 and give Bob 2000.  Since we're both losing money due to inflation, I'm willing to reduce my share slightly to avoid a stalemate."
