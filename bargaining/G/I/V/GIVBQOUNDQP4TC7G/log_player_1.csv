"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a majority of the money, but also leaves a significant portion for Bob. I hope this will be enough for him to accept in the first round, avoiding the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation penalty is now in effect. Accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, even though it is significantly lower than my initial proposal.  It's better to secure something than risk losing even more in the following rounds."
