"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get a good deal!""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. The message is just a friendly opening offer, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  We both get half. It's the best way to ensure we both get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a bit more. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!""
}
```"
