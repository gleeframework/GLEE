"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
