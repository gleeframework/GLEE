I'm going to offer Bob $1, and keep the rest. I figure he'll be desperate enough to accept anything in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to get more, I know the money is worth less each round. A 50/50 split is a good deal for me now."
