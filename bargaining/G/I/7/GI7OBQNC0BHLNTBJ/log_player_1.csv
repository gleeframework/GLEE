"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose that I receive $90 and Bob receives $10. I'm starting with a strong offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's more interested in getting a smaller share now rather than potentially getting a better deal later with inflation in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something. With inflation, each round decreases my potential gains.  It's better to get 40% now than risk getting even less later."
