"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not satisfied with the terms of the offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the effects of inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm aiming for a slightly better share for myself this time."
