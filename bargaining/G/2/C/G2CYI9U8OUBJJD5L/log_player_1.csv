"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering I'm losing more value per round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 3 of the game. In the previous rounds, both Alice (me) and Bob made offers that were rejected by the other party. The money's value decreases with each round due to inflation - 5% for me and 10% for Bob.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on our offers
Given that the value of money decreases more significantly for Bob (10% each round) than for me (5% each round), I should adjust my offer to reflect this. The longer the game continues, the less value Bob gets from the same nominal amount, making it more urgent for him to settle.

### Step 3: Formulate a new offer
Considering the urgency for Bob due to the higher rate of value loss and the fact that my previous offer was rejected, I should make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer but still advantageous to me, given the circumstances.

### Step 4: Decide on the specifics of the offer
My initial offer was 55 for me and 45 for Bob. Considering the factors mentioned, I will adjust my offer to be slightly more favorable to Bob but still recognizing the impact of inflation and the need for a mutually agreeable solution.

### Step 5: Write the offer in the required format
I will send an offer that reflects the considerations above.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}"
