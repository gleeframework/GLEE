"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but it's still a relatively even division.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation, my offer needs to take that into account. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 45-55 split, which takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, considering the inflation is still going strong! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be extremely cautious.

However, Bob's offer of a 40-60 split is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if it's the best I can do. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my offer needs to be even more cautious.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32.4,
  ""bob_gain"": 67.6,
  ""message"": ""I'm really struggling to make ends meet with the inflation. I'll take this, but it's a tough pill to swallow.""
}
```

I'm offering a 32.4-67.6 split, which is a significant concession on my part. I'm hoping Bob will take this offer and we can finally end the game."
