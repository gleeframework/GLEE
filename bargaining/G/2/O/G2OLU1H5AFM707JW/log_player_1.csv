"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but it's still a generous offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than before, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offer from Bob, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer for myself. Since my gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to be more cautious due to inflation. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a big risk and give you a very small share, but I think it's worth it to get most of the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really taking a risk with this offer! With inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than before, so I need to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting this low offer.

However, considering the offers I've made and rejected so far, I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting such a low offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the aggressive offer from Bob in round 4, I'll try to make a more moderate offer that still takes into account the effects of inflation.

Since my gain is worth 19.09% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground. This offer should be fair considering the inflation. What do you think?""
