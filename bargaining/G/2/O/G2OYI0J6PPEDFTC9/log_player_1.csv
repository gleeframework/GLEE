"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, which seems fair and reasonable."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because I was hoping to get a better deal, considering the decreased value of the money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much""}

I'm trying to make a more competitive offer, but still keeping some buffer for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to make a move 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's not ideal, I'm not sure I can do better.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will make up for the difference in future rounds."
