"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'd get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

I'll reject his offer. It's a bit too skewed in his favor, considering the inflation rate. I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a more even split.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which should be more acceptable to Bob."
