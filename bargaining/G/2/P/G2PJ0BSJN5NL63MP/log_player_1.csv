"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $999,999 and give Bob $1.  This is a very generous offer, and I expect Bob to accept it immediately.  After all, he gets something, and I'm willing to take almost everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, taking 400,000 is still a significant amount of money.  There is a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob will offer me less in the next round. It's also possible that Bob will offer me less next round.  It's better to take what I can get now, rather than risk getting nothing."
