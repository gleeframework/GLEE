"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is still less than my initial offer, I'll reject it. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me this time. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
