Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000

```

Reasoning:

At this point, the game is entering a critical stage where accepting a less-than-ideal offer might be better than risking getting nothing. 

* The value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Each round makes a huge difference.
* While Alice's offer isn't great, it's better than what Bob proposed last round, and it's unlikely Alice will offer more favorable terms.

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now locks in some profit before inflation eats away even more of the potential winnings."
