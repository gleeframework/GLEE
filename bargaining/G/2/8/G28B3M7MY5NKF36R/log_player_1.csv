"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60/40. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20/80 split, but I'm willing to compromise.
