"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation affecting the value of our money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, I'll calculate the total amount we'll each get in real value.

My gain: $5,000 (face value) is worth $5,000 (no inflation)
Bob's gain: $5,000 (face value) is worth $4,000 (20% less due to inflation)

I'd rather have more money in real value, so I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""You're being too optimistic about inflation, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to secure my share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
