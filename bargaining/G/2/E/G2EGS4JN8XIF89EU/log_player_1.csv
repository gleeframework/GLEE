Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's end this quickly.

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the money is decreasing for me.  But I'm still holding out for a fairer split. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is the same as Bob's initial offer, it's important to remember the impact of inflation on his returns.  He's losing value with each passing round. Accepting now guarantees me a good deal and avoids the risk of him offering even less in future rounds as his potential gain diminishes."
