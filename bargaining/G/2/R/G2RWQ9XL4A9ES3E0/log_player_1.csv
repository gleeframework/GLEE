"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, but I'm hoping for a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this case, I'll reject the offer because I think I'm getting a relatively worse deal compared to the initial offer. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll try to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% of the remaining money, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're closer to my range, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 14.26% less than the initial amount, and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less. Considering the numbers, I'll have to weigh the relative values.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer because it's closer to the original 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
