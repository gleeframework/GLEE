Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as the rounds progress, and her offers reflect that. While $4,400 isn't ideal, holding out for a better deal is still the stronger move for Bob at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. It's the fairest deal for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Halfway through the rounds, a 50/50 split becomes a strategically sound offer. It sends a clear message of fairness while also putting pressure on Alice, who is experiencing the brunt of the inflation. Accepting guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, and there's a good chance Alice will see it as the best offer she'll get at this point."
