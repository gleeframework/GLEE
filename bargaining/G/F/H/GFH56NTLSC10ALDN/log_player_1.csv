"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is a generous offer considering the inflation rate that affects him. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount, and Bob will still get a significant share despite the decreasing value of the money for him. Fingers crossed he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation affects me more. Let's work together to get the most out of this! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with the 55/45 split, especially since the inflation doesn't affect me. I think I can get a better deal, considering Bob is under more pressure due to the decreasing value of the money for him. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round. Bring it on!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer!""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to decrease my initial offer slightly, taking into account the pressure Bob is under due to the inflation. I'm still getting the bigger share, but I believe this offer is reasonable, and Bob should consider accepting it before the money loses even more value for him. Hopefully, he'll see it my way this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to offer 6000 to you, which is still more than what you offered last round, and I'm taking a hit due to the inflation.  Let's end this quickly and split the money fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWait, what? Bob's offer doesn't add up! He says he's offering me 6000, but the numbers show I'd be getting 4000. I think there's been a mistake in the proposal. Even if the numbers were correct, I'm not sure I'd accept, but with this error, I have to reject. Let's try again and see if we can get it right next time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, let's be realistic about the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share again, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob. With each passing round, the inflation is taking a bigger toll on his potential gain, so I believe I have the upper hand in the negotiations. I'm still offering him a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this. Hopefully, Bob will see the reality of the situation and accept this offer. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this inflation is really hurting me. Let's end this now and get as much as we can. I'm willing to give you 3500, but I can't go lower.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think Bob's got it backwards! He's offering me 3500, but I've been offering him less than that in previous rounds. Considering the massive hit he's taking due to inflation, I believe I can get a much better deal. His gain is worth a whopping 67.23% less than in the first round, so I'm not worried about him walking away. I'll reject this offer and see what the next round brings. The pressure's on, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is killing your gain, Bob. Let's end this!""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, the inflation has taken a massive toll on Bob's potential gain, and I believe I have all the leverage. I'm offering him 3000, which is still a decent amount, but I'm not willing to go any higher. With each passing round, the money is worth less and less to him, so I think it's time for him to accept this offer and walk away with something. If he rejects, I'll just keep increasing my share. The ball's in his court!"
