# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split. With inflation looming, I think we should aim for a fairer division to benefit us both.

""alice_gain"": 5700,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll, and I'm feeling the pinch more than you. I think this offer is more reflective of the urgency and the differing inflation rates we're facing. Let's settle on this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting bolder, but this offer is still unacceptable.  Even with the higher inflation he faces, he's trying to take a significant advantage. I need to hold firm and emphasize the shrinking pot."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of your greed. This offer is a compromise. Take it before inflation eats up even more of our potential gains.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're both losing out, but the inflation disparity means I'm hurting more. This offer reflects that. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree, as the value is decreasing rapidly for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob is playing hardball and using his higher inflation rate as leverage. However, accepting $4,000 now is a guaranteed loss compared to my initial offer.  I need to show I'm serious about walking away too if he doesn't move closer to a fairer split.  There's still time, but the pressure is on."
