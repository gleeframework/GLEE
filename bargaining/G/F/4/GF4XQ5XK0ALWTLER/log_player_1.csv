"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll decide to reject it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I deserve only 40% of the total, especially since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation affects you more""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a more significant portion than before, taking into account the impact of inflation on his earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I want it to be exactly 50/50 this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has changed his mind and wants to meet me in the middle after all.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can finally settle on a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement."
