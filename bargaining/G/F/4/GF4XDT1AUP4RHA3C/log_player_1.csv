Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both get a decent amount, and I'll get more than you, but it's not too far off.  We can stop this game right now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
