"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a little greedy, I'll give you a chance to get more in the next round 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to consider the actual value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is equivalent to $5,000 in the previous round. Not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

On the other hand, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk going back to the negotiating table with an even worse offer.

I'll decide to...
