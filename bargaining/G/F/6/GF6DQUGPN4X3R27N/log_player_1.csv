I'm proposing to take 900,000$ and leave 100,000$ for Bob.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's better than nothing, I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 600,000$ split for me and 400,000$ for Bob. This is a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that I have the opportunity to propose in this round."
