  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a stronger counteroffer!

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You can't have all the fun, let's meet in the middle!""
