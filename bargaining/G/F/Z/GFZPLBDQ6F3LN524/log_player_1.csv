"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 60% share for Bob just yet. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 will be:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm trying to get a bit more for myself, but still keeping the offer relatively fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite! My offer from Round 3 was already worth less, and now it's even less valuable. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer is actually quite generous.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I think I'll take this offer. It's not the best I could have hoped for, but it's better than going into further rounds with the value of my share decreasing."
