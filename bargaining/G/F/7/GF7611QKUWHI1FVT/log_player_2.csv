Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to give you a bigger share this time, but I need to get at least 700k. We're running out of rounds, so let's make a deal!

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is better than Alice's previous offer, time is working against me more than her.  I need to signal I'm willing to accept a less favorable deal soon or risk getting nothing."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I need a larger portion. Let's come to an agreement before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting greedier, sensing my desperation as time runs out. Accepting this offer would be disastrous considering the significant loss I'd face from inflation.  I need to show I'm willing to walk away, even if it's risky."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. I'm taking a big hit from inflation, but I need us to agree NOW. This is the best you'll get, take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting extremely risky. I need to signal I'm willing to accept a significantly smaller amount to avoid getting nothing. This offer is less than my previous offer, showing Alice I'm serious about reaching a deal *immediately*, but it's still more than her last offer to me. This needs to be the final push."
