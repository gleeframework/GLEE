"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering you $400,000, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer.

In the first round, $600,000 was 60% of the total, and $400,000 was 40%. Now, due to inflation, $500,000 is only 50% of the total.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll have to consider it. I'll reject the offer for now.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and 22% less than in the first round.

My new offer is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering you $450,000, and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer.

In the first round, $600,000 was 60% of the total, and $400,000 was 40%. Now, due to inflation, $475,000 is approximately 47.5% of the total.

This offer is actually slightly better for me than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept the offer.
