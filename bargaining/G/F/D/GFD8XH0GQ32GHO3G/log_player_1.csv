"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, but I'll give you a chance to do better""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which is a relatively generous starting offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. My current proposal was already relatively generous, and Bob's offer is not much better. I'll try to do better next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal from me, but I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share""
}
```

This offer gives me $7,000 and Bob $3,000, a bit more generous than before. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a deal, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good enough share.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the current state of the money. I'd rather settle for a smaller share now than risk getting even less in future rounds.
