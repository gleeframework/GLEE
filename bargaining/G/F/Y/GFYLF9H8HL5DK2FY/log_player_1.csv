"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, 30% of the original 100$ is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for a worse offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
