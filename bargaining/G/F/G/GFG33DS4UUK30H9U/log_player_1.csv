Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that's heavily in my favor, since I'm the one making the offer.  It's likely Bob will reject this, but I want to see if he'll take a risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, it's still a decent amount, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now before the inflation hits harder."
