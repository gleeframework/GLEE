"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a bit greedy in the first round, let's try for a more balanced split this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected, but I'm not sure if I want to give up too much.

Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the amounts:

* My gain: $300,000
* Bob's gain: $700,000

In terms of actual value, I'd be getting $270,000 (90% of $300,000) and Bob would be getting $630,000 (90% of $700,000).

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's try for a 42-58 split!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm keeping $420,000 (which is worth $378,000 in actual value due to inflation) and giving Bob $580,000 (worth $522,000 in actual value). I'm hoping this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
