  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me (Alice) getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Let me know what Bob decides!"

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5040,
  ""bob_gain"": 4960,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""
}
```

I've taken into account the 20% decrease in value for my gain in Round 2, and another 20% decrease for this round, so I've adjusted my offer accordingly. I'm offering a slightly uneven split, with me getting $5,040 (which is worth less due to inflation) and Bob getting $4,960. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
