Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very slight advantage for myself. I figure Bob might be tempted to accept, hoping for a better deal in the next round. However, I'm also aware of the inflation risk, so I'm leaving a tiny bit for him just in case."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more, this is a fair split and the inflation risk is starting to make me nervous.  I'm happy to take this and end the game."
