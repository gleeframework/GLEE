"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable proposal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to think carefully... 50/50 sounds fair, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk waiting for a worse offer in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
