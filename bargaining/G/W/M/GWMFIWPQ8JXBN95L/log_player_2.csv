"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the faster devaluation of the money for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the devaluation of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll propose a split that reflects this difference in devaluation rates.
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is more reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It accounts for the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it seems more reasonable considering the increasing impact of inflation, and further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for both of us.
