I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. It's risky, but I want to see if he'll accept a low offer early on.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to give in so easily. I know he's losing more money than me due to inflation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm raising my offer a bit, but I'm still keeping the majority.  Bob's greed might be his downfall. Let's see if he'll accept a slightly better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm losing a lot of value with each round, and Bob's offer, while still not ideal, is getting closer to what I'd like. I'm not sure if I can hold out for a better deal, so I'll take what I can get before the money becomes completely worthless."
