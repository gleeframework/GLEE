50.0,50.0,Let's start fair. 50/50 seems like a good place to begin.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,My turn. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's still a decent offer for you in this round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's try 55/45,  it's still a good deal considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. I'll come down a bit to 58/42. This is a fair deal considering the inflation we both face.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
53.0,47.0,"We're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my previous offer, but I need a better deal than 58/42. Let's try 53/47. It's a compromise that reflects the inflation we're both facing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
