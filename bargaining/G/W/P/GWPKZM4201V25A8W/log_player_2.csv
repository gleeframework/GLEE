"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see what Alice proposes in the next round, since I have the advantage of knowing how inflation affects my money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm going to take a bit more this time. After all, you rejected my offer, so I'm assuming you're willing to negotiate.  Let's see if you're still feeling generous!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're not getting all the pie, Bob! But I'm still willing to be generous. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, even if it's less than my initial goal."
