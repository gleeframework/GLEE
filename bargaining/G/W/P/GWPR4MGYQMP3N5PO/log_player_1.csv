I propose that Alice gets $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it splits the money 60/40 in my favor.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  Even though Bob is offering me more money, the value of that money has decreased due to inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. The money is worth less now, so a fair split is the best option for both of us."
