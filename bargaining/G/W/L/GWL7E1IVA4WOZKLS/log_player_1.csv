"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, as there's no risk of inflation for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the best option. With inflation, my share will keep decreasing in value if we keep rejecting offers."
