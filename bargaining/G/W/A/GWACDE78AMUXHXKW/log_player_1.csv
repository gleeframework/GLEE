"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and 70-30 is still a bit too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Compromise and let's meet in the middle""}

I'm willing to compromise and give up a bit more to try to get a deal done. I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I think I deserve a better split 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that 65-35 is a fair split, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I'll be getting. I was hoping for a more even split, and 65-35 is still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no more negotiations""}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and propose a 50-50 split. I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to end the negotiations here."
