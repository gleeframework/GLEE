Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again.  This offer gives me a slight edge considering the inflation, but it's still a win for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  Even though it's not a perfect split, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
