"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000 and $4,000 respectively. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take half, fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. With inflation, my potential gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,000 in real terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, considering the value of the money will continue to decrease with each passing round. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing by 20% each round, I need to think strategically. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share, you can get a small share! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is dropping rapidly!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. With inflation, my potential gain of $3,000 is actually worth only $1,568 in real terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the value of the money will continue to decrease. I'd like to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a larger share to myself, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, take the crumbs! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. With inflation, my potential gain of $1,000 is actually worth only $333 in real terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share, especially considering the value of the money will continue to decrease. I'd like to make another counteroffer, but I'm starting to think I should be more aggressive to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are high!

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll make a very aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm taking a huge risk by offering Bob such a small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it before the value of the money drops to almost nothing. This is my last-ditch effort to get a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take it all, you can leave! 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's do or die!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. With inflation, the value of the money is almost negligible, and I'd be left with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with zero. I'd rather go to the next round and try to negotiate a better deal, even if it's just for the sake of principle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going down without a fight!

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'll make a symbolic offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 9999,
  ""message"": ""You win, I concede. Congratulations, Bob!""
}
```

I'm essentially giving Bob the entire amount, but I'm doing it with a hint of sarcasm. I'm acknowledging that the value of the money is almost zero, and it's not worth fighting for."
