"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

I'd rather not give up 200,000$ to Bob, so I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to meet Bob's previous proposal, but I'm still trying to get a slightly higher share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the power! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 150,000$, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept his offer.
