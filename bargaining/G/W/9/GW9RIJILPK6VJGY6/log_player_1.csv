"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going for a greedy strategy in the first round. I want to maximize my share, but I'm also aware of the potential for inflation. Offering Bob a tiny amount might make him more likely to reject and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and there's no guarantee that I can do better in the next round.  I'm willing to accept the 50/50 split, especially with the uncertainty of future rounds and potential inflation."
