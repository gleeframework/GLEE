"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but still leaving some room for adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it. The 20% decrease in value means that the money is worth less, and I'd like to get a larger share to account for the reduced purchasing power.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to keep up with inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to account for inflation, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it. The 48.8% decrease in value means that the money is worth even less, and I'd like to get a larger share to account for the reduced purchasing power.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need a bit more to make up for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 42-58 split in Bob's favor, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800. I'm trying to be more generous, but I still want to get a decent share."
