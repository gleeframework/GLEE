"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more efficient with our resources. This split is more fair, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm in a tough spot. Bob's offer is tempting, but I need to consider the long game. 

Let's break it down:

* **Bob's Offer:** 
    * I get $4000 (worth $3600 after inflation). 
    * He gets $6000.
* **If I Reject:**
    * I risk getting a worse offer later.
    * I have a chance to propose a more favorable split.

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's not terrible either. Rejecting it means gambling on getting a better deal in the future rounds, but the value of the money will keep decreasing for me.
