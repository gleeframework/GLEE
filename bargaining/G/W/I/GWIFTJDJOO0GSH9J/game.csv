45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a good starting point, but with the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Think about it - we both lose if we wait too long!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's cut our losses and split it evenly. We both lose more money with each round, so a 50/50 split is the best outcome now.",Alice,3,
