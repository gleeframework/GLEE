I'm going to reject this offer.  1000$ is not a good deal for me, especially since I know there are more rounds to come and the money will be worth less to me if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and reasonable offer that should hopefully lead to a quick resolution."
