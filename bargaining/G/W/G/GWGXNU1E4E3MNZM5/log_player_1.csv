"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total amount. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to see if he'll accept a relatively equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

Alice gain: $300,000 is worth 80% of $375,000 (which is 20% less than $450,000, the value of $600,000 in the first round).

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejection. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still a bit less than the original $600,000 I wanted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in terms of the original $1,000,000.

Alice gain: $350,000 is worth 35% of $1,000,000, considering the 48.8% decrease in value.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me due to inflation, and considering Bob's previous offers, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the remaining difference. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $510,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, and a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
