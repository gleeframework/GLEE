"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the 10% inflation that has already occurred. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
