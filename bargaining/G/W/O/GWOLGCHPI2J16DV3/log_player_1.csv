I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share to encourage him to accept in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher share for myself, Bob's offer is fair and accepting it ensures we both get something.  The risk of further inflation makes holding out too risky, especially considering the already reduced value of the money."
