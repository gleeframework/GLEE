"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to give up that much more than I initially proposed. I'll wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, while still trying to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is losing value rapidly. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or not.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Given the decreasing value of the money, I think it's better to accept this offer and get a fixed amount rather than risking further inflation."
