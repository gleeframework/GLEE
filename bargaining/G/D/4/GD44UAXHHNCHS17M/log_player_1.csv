"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $5000 is now worth less than my original proposal of $6000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
