"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, but I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both have a better chance of getting more if we keep going, but the money is losing value fast. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value so quickly, I'd rather take the even split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
