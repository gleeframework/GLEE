"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but you'll get a chance to negotiate in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take 90% of the initial $10,000 and Bob takes the remaining 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We can then both keep more as the game progresses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4500
* Bob gain: 4500

I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
