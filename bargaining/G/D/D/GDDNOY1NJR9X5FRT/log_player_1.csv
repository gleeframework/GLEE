"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take $100,000 and let's work from there.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70% now, and we can work from there. Your turn next round! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob is proposing a 70% share, that's a significant increase from his initial offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this.

I'll decide to reject this offer and propose a new one in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the initial amount. I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this time, Bob. Take $400,000 and let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still a fair split. Your turn next round! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is continuing to lose value, and I need to be careful about the shares. Considering the decreasing value, I'll have to be cautious not to give away too much.

Bob's offer is still a relatively close split, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

I'll decide to reject this offer and propose a new one in Round 5.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is continuing to lose value, and I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Considering the 27.1% loss for me and 48.8% loss for Bob compared to the initial amount, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, Bob. Take $460,000 and let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share now, but still willing to compromise. Don't want to go to the last rounds! 
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is continuing to lose value rapidly, and I need to be careful not to give away too much. Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise, and this offer is still a relatively close split. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
