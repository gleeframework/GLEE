"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your share is decreasing faster than mine, Alice. Let's be realistic. This offer is better for both of us in the long run.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm losing money with every round and you're not budging.  I'm willing to stick to my previous offer, but this is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is pressuring me, I know her position is weakening faster than mine.  I've rejected this offer before, and she's likely to offer even more in the next round as the inflation continues to erode the value of her potential winnings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out for both of us, but especially for you. I'm increasing my offer, but this is as high as I'm willing to go.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation. This is my final offer - meet me in the middle or let's call it quits. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offer is getting closer to a more even split. I'm going to call her bluff on the ""final offer"" and see if I can push my advantage further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical.  This is a fair split, and we both know it. Take the deal before inflation eats away even more of your share.""
