"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to see how he reacts, and I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. I think 55/45 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 9% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 45% share, but it's a more even split than before. I'll consider it.
