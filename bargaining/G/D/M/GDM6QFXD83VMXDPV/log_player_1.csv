"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer considering Bob has the option to refuse and make his own proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16

I'll accept this offer.
