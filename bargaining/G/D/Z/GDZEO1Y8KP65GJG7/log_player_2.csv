"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's always worth seeing what Alice will offer in the next round.  While 40$ is a decent starting point, I can potentially get more by waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial offer I made. Let's see if you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is offering less than she did in the first round, even with the inflation factor.  I'm still hoping for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers.  Let's both compromise a bit and see if we can reach an agreement.""}
