"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $50, and we can end the game here!"
