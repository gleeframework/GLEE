"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreased value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping to get a better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value of money, I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively close split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll accept this offer.
