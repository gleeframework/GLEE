"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer saves us both time and ensures we get the most out of it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need more for myself. This offer is more equitable for us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a good deal considering the inflation and the fact that I could have gotten more in the previous round. Let's be practical and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a better deal, given the inflation and Alice's finality, it's better to take what I can get."
