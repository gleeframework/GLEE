"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see what Bob will propose in response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious and consider the long-term implications.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about splitting it evenly, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option, especially since I'm already facing a 5% decrease in value. I'd like to see if we can come up with a more strategic proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This split should be more beneficial for both of us.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more to avoid another round. Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money. I need to be strategic about my next move. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer, as it's a reasonable compromise considering the current situation. I'll take the $4,500 and call it a day."
