"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a split that gives me a large majority of the money, leaving Bob with a small share. This is a strategy to incentivize Bob to accept quickly, as he might be willing to take a small amount now rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds if inflation affects him negatively."
