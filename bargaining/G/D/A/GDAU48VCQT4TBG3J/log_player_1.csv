Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer for me to get the majority of the money this time, as I'm taking the risk of you rejecting this offer.  But I'm still willing to give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
