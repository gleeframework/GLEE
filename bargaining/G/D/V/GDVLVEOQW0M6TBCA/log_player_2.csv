Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 65/35.  I think this is fair considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money, and I don't want to risk losing even more in the next round.
