Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5800

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round.  Delaying further means both of us lose more.
* **Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for him and slightly better for me. This suggests he's feeling the pressure of the devaluation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in the next round, and the devaluation will make the potential gains even smaller.

Accepting a 4200 split isn't ideal, but it's better than risking a worse outcome in the face of rapid devaluation."
