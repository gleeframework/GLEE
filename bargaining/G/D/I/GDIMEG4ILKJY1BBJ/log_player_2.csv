"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's start off fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good deal for you right now considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's pushing it. Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit less than my initial offer, but 55/45 is my bottom line this round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'm not ready to accept yet. The inflation is indeed affecting both of us, but I believe I can still negotiate for a better share, especially since Alice's gain is worth significantly less now. Let's move on to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I think this is a fair adjustment. Your gain might be worth less, but it's still a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it down the middle 50/50.  We're both losing out with all this inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}
Given the current state of inflation and the fact that both of our gains are significantly reduced, a 50/50 split seems fair. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further losses for both of us, so I'll accept this offer."
