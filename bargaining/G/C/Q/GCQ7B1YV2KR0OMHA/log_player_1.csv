"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $5000 / 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = $6250
* Bob's gain: $5000 / 0.9 (10% less due to inflation) = $5555.56

I'm not sure if this is a fair split, but I'll consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'll try to do better. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from my perspective.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $5200 / 0.5168 (48.8% less due to inflation) ≈ $1008.41
* Bob's gain: $4800 / 0.7279 (27.1% less due to inflation) ≈ $659.15

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. Can we meet in the middle from my perspective?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increased inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'll match your offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm essentially repeating my previous offer, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept it this time around."
