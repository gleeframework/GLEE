"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation will affect your share more than mine. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I'm the one who's being affected by the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split considering the inflation. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll still get a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
