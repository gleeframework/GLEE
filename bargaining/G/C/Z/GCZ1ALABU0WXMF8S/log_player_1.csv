"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob. It's a big chunk for me, but I want to see if he's willing to take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While 400,000$ is a significant amount, it's far less than what I was initially offered, and with the inflation, it's worth even less. I'll take my chances and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try and get a bit closer to the original offer. I propose 700,000$ for myself and 300,000$ for Bob.  Let's see if he's more willing to negotiate now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer to him, and I'm not willing to accept such a large reduction.  I'll see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm still trying to get a decent amount, but I'm also recognizing that time is running out. I'm offering 650,000$ for myself and 350,000$ for Bob. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but I believe I can still get a better deal than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, as the inflation is really starting to bite. However, with 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. While this offer is lower than my initial proposal, it's still a decent sum, and accepting it guarantees I get something."
