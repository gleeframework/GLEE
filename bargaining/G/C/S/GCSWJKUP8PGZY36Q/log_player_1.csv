"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a very uneven split. This is because, with the inflation, I want to maximize my gains in the early rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he rejects it, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and I'm not going to accept it. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. Even though inflation is working against me, I'm still in a strong position. I know Bob is desperate for money, but I'm not going to give in to his demands so easily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 850,000 for myself and 150,000 for Bob. While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I want to show some flexibility. Bob rejected my previous offer, so he might be willing to compromise a bit more. I'll be prepared to adjust my offer further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too unfair.  I won't accept it. I know that if I keep rejecting his proposals, the money will become less valuable with each round due to inflation. But I'm willing to risk it to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but only slightly. I'm hoping that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling time and the constant rejection of his offers.  This time, I'm offering 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm not going to give in to his unfair demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too one-sided. I'm not going to give in to his demands, even with the increasing inflation. I believe that I can still get a better deal if I keep rejecting his offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer once more.  I'm willing to give Bob a slightly bigger share, but I'm still pushing for a majority.  I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm determined to get a fair deal. The remaining rounds are dwindling quickly, and Bob needs to understand that we both need to find a solution."
