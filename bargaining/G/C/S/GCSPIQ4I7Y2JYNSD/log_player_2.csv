"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can find a solution that works better for both of us. This offer accounts for the time-value of money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it and propose something fairer, even with the inflation factor.
* **Proposed Offer:** This offer is slightly more in my favor, acknowledging that the money is losing value faster for me than for Alice.  
* **The Message:** The message aims to be collaborative and frame the offer as a mutually beneficial solution.  It also subtly introduces the idea that waiting has a cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is starting to significantly erode the value of the money, especially for me. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  While still favoring Alice, her offer is now much closer to an even split after factoring in the inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer in hopes of getting a slightly better deal in the next round is too risky. The inflation means any potential gains from a better offer would be heavily offset by the decreased value of the money."
