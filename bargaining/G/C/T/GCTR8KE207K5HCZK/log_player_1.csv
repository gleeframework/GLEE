"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's see if we can do better from here 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me $4750 and himself $4750.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split and we're meeting in the middle.
