# Bob's message: You could have taken the 50/50 split, now I'm making a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I was willing to accept a 50/50 split initially, and now Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll wait for a better offer."
