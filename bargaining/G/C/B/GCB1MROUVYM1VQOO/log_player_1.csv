"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start with this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 in this round is actually worth $5,000 * 0.9 = $4,500 compared to the first round's $6,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of $4,500 is actually worth $4,500 * 0.9 = $4,050.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take a slightly larger share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better share""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $5,500 in this round is actually worth $5,500 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $4,002.35 compared to the first round's $6,000.

I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since my gain is worth $4,002.35, I'll decide to accept the offer.
