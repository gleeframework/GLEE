Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's settle this. I'll accept your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is the best outcome for Alice at this point. Accepting ensures Alice receives a gain, whereas continued rejection risks Bob offering even less in subsequent rounds."
