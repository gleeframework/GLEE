"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth 80% of $4,000, which is $3,200. And Bob's gain of $7,000 remains the same.

I'm not sure I like the 30/70 split, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.
