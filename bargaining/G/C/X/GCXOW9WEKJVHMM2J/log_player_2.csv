Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll give you a tiny bit more than before 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one! Here's why I'm finally accepting:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less money I'm actually getting due to inflation. Even though 43 is much less than I'd like, waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently offered proposals favoring herself. It's unlikely she'll suddenly become much more generous. 

Taking the 43 now is better than risking an even lower amount in the next round."
