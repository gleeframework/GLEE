"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a different split. Since I'm the one experiencing inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value. How about we do a 50/50 split? That way, we both get an equal share, and I won't lose out too much due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice. I'm curious to see her response!"
