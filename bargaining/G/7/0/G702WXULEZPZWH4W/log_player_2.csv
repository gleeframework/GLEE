"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I know this money is valuable.  Let's start with a fair but firm offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice's offer is in the next round, given that I'm not satisfied with her initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's avoid losing too much money. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to avoid inflation, but this offer is still too generous for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but let's work together to find a more equitable solution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer ensures I get something while minimizing the risk of inflation eating away at the potential gains."
