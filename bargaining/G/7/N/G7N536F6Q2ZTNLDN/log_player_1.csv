"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division. I think this is a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'm not as excited about a 50-50 split. I was hoping to get a bit more. But, Bob's message about meeting in the middle does sound reasonable. I'll accept this offer for now.
