Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to 50/50 but account for the fact that I'm offering first to make it slightly advantageous for you, Bob.  This way we both benefit from acting quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I could potentially gain more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, the risk of inflation makes this offer very attractive.  A near 50/50 split with a small advantage for me is a good outcome, especially considering the potential loss if we continue to play."
