Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite bold, Alice! I'm willing to make a deal, but it needs to be more balanced. How about a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor?  Consider that the value decreases for both of us as we progress. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
