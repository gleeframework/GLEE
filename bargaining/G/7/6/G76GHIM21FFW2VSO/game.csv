70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. I propose I take $70 and you take $30.  It's a good offer for you to consider given the inflation we are facing.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation hurts me more. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, time is running out, and this money is losing value fast.  My last offer was generous. This time I'll take $65, and you get $35.  It's better than what you'll get if we keep playing this game.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I acknowledge your desire for a larger share, but we need to find a middle ground.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  This factors in the inflation, and ensures we both benefit from this deal sooner rather than later.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of the inflation. My last offer is $60 for me and $40 for you. Take it or leave it - but leaving it means risking getting even less in the next round!",Alice,5,
