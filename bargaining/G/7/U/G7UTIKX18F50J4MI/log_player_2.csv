"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable arrangement. This offer reflects the time value of money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject and counter with a more balanced proposal.
* **Time Value:** The money loses value for Bob with each round.  Offering slightly more than half incentivizes Alice to settle now rather than risk getting a less favorable deal later (from her perspective).
* **Negotiation:** The message aims to be firm yet open to finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The 19% inflation hit significantly reduces the value of delaying further for Bob. 
* **Shift in Power:** Alice's offer is now better than what Bob proposed in Round 2. The longer the game goes, the more the inflation hurts Bob and strengthens Alice's position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a marginally better deal isn't worth the potential loss from further inflation. Accepting ensures a reasonable payout given the circumstances."
