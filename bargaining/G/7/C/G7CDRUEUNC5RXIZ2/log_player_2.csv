Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money! This is my final offer before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes on, the more both players lose. However, the impact is more substantial on Alice (10% per round) than Bob (5% per round).  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Waiting for a better offer in future rounds is risky. Alice's offers are unlikely to significantly improve, and the value of any potential gain will be diminished by inflation.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum. Rejecting this offer puts Bob in a weaker position for the next round, where he might be forced to accept even less.

While 4200 isn't the optimal outcome, it's a pragmatic decision considering the circumstances.
