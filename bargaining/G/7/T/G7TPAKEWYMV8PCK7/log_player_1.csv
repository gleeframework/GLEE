I'm going for a large share, but leaving Bob with something.  Hopefully, he'll accept, knowing that he'll have the chance to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'm getting a significantly smaller share, it's still a substantial amount, and rejecting would mean I'd likely get even less in the next round due to inflation."
