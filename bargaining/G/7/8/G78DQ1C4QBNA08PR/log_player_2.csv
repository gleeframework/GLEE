Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Even split is nice, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is creeping closer to a more even split, time is working against me.  It's better to hold out and hope she offers something closer to 50/50 in the next round or two. Accepting 43 now means I'm losing almost 20% of the initial potential value due to inflation."
