"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a risky game, and Bob should aim for a larger share in the early rounds. He'll need to be careful with his offers later on, but starting with a rejection will keep the pressure on Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the risk involved in playing this game. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a fairer split given the risk I'm taking 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should continue to reject.  He's already seen Alice is willing to negotiate, and he knows he can get more than 3000, especially considering the decreasing value of the money for him. He should aim for a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share than before, but 70/30 is still too low. Let's split it 70/30, with the 70 going to me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 65/35 is a more reasonable split given the original 4:1 proposal 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should continue to reject.  He's still losing a significant amount of value with each passing round, and he can likely secure a better deal. Even though Alice is offering more than the original 4:1 split, the 65/35 split is still too low for Bob, given the risk he's taking with the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""The money is losing value quickly, I'm going to need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 80/20, with the 80 going to me.""}
``` 

Bob needs to be more aggressive at this point. The money is losing value rapidly, and he needs to secure a deal that will compensate for the risk. While this offer is bold, it's the best chance Bob has to get a decent payout before the value of the money drops even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 55/45 is the maximum I can accept before I start to lose out due to inflation 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob needs to be pragmatic at this point. The money is losing value rapidly, and this offer gives him a decent share while still securing some of the money. Holding out for a bigger share risks getting nothing at all if the rounds run out."
