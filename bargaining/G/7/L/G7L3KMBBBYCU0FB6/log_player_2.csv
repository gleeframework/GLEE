Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split, considering we both want a share of the money. Let's be realistic, Alice.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a compromise. However, I need to be firm in this negotiation. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Analyze Alice's offer and message.
Alice's offer is $25 for me and $75 for her, with a message stating it's her final offer.

### Step 2: Consider the implications of accepting or rejecting the offer.
If I accept, I get $25, but if I reject, I risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.

### Step 3: Evaluate the possibility of getting a better offer in future rounds.
Given Alice's firm stance, it's uncertain whether she'll increase her offer in subsequent rounds.

### Step 4: Weigh the risks and benefits of each decision.
Accepting guarantees $25, but rejecting might lead to a better offer or nothing.

### Step 5: Make a decision based on the analysis.
Given the uncertainty and the risk of getting nothing, accepting $25 seems like the safer option.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Alice's offer of $25, as it seems unlikely she'll increase her offer, and I risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
