"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm giving Bob a slight advantage. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 2000 is now effectively 1600. I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a significant amount for me, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will also be 20% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! My gain of 3000 is now effectively 1600, which is a significant decrease from the previous rounds.

However, considering the decreasing value of money, I think I should accept this offer. It's not a great deal, but it's better than going further and risking getting even less.
