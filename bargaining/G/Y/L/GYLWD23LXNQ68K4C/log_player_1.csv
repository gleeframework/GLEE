"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gains, I need to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, it's a relatively fair split. However, I still want to get a bit more, considering I'm the one who made the initial offer and got rejected.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'll get a bit more than the 50/50 split, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get more than 50% of the remaining amount. With the money worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the inflation has affected my gains more significantly, I'll have to be cautious. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher share again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll try to get back to a 60/40 split, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
