I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  I want to keep the majority of the money, but also leave a small incentive for him to accept in the first round. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it would be great to get more, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy. My share is worth less due to inflation, but I don't know what impact inflation has had on Bob's share.  It's likely he's also facing a loss in value, so this 50/50 split is a fair compromise.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too high."
