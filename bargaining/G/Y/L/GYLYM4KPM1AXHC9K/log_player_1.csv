"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a straightforward 50-50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid any potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

In this case, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money I'll be getting. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You seemed willing to give me 40, so I'll meet you in the middle""

Round 4

# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58
