Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse for me with each round. I understand you want a good deal, but I need to account for the inflation that's affecting my share. Let's be reasonable and find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to frame the situation emotionally (""my offer is getting worse,"" ""let's be reasonable"").  While it's true her share is affected by inflation, it's important to focus on the actual numbers. My potential gain is slowly decreasing, but I can still hold out for a better offer in the next round."
