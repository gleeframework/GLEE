"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to take the small amount now rather than risk getting nothing if we go through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me half the money and avoids the risk of getting nothing in future rounds."
