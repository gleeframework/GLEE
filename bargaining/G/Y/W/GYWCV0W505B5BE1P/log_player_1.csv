"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more for being the one who makes the next proposal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering that the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than it initially seems.

However, I'm not convinced that I should accept a significantly lower share. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of making the first proposal""
}
```

I've increased my share slightly, but still left some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of making the next proposal and considering the reduced value of the money 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up!

Considering that the money is worth significantly less now, I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, I still don't think Bob's offer is entirely fair, given the reduced value of the money.

I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I can do better than 300k. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up much more than that""
}
```

I've increased my share slightly, but I'm still trying to keep the gap between our shares relatively small."
