"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm trying to secure a large portion of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer. I will reject it and attempt to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a compromise.  I'm willing to lower my share to 700,000 to show flexibility, but I still need to secure a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it still falls short of my desired outcome. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to secure a large share. I'm offering Bob 400,000, hoping he'll accept it before the inflation significantly affects the value of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation, Bob's offer is the most reasonable so far. I need to secure a deal before we both lose more money."
