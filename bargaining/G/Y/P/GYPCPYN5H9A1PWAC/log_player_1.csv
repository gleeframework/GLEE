"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000 for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. 

In the first round, I was offered $6,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd get $5,400.

Bob's offer of $5,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so he'd get $4,000.

Considering the inflation, my gain in Bob's offer is actually more than my gain in my initial offer. I'll accept this offer.
