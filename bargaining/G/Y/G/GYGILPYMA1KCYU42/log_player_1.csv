Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""

```
This offer heavily favors Bob, especially with inflation. I need to negotiate a better deal."

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a more equitable split. Let's try to agree on something that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, this offer is better than the previous one and the effects of inflation are becoming more significant. Accepting now avoids further losses for both of us."
