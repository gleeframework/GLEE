Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 90% of the initial amount, I'll offer something similar, but slightly less. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 980000, ""alice_gain"": 20000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the offer is actually more favorable to me than it seems, since the money I gain is worth 36% less. I'll accept this offer.
