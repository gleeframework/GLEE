Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This way, we both get a good amount, and it's a better starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
