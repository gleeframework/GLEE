Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical Alice. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you 40$. It's a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. 35$ is the best you'll get considering how fast the value is dropping for you. Let's be smart and end this here. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not ideal, it's better than nothing. The inflation is hitting me hard, and I risk losing everything if I reject and keep going."
