"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000$ and leave 1000$ for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation if Bob is willing to continue the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. My share is worth 10% less due to inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future. It's better to secure 5000$ now than risk getting nothing at all."
