"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a significant amount of money, I think I can do better. I'm also considering the inflation factor, especially for Alice. I'm hoping I can secure a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for inflation and ensures we both receive a fair share. I hope you'll accept it!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the best deal for both of us. Think about the long-term gain here. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bigger share. I've learned that Alice is willing to negotiate and the inflation factor is working in my favor. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I understand we've both been negotiating, but I'm confident this offer is fair given the inflation and the fact that it's my turn to propose. Let's end this game on a positive note.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer or the deal will be significantly worse for both of us next round. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a larger share, Alice's threat about the deal getting worse next round is a serious one.  Given the significant inflation affecting Alice's share, this is probably the best outcome for me. I'm accepting the offer."
