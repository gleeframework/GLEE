"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor. Will you accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my offer from round 1 is now worth even less. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed in my favor, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. Will Bob accept?"
