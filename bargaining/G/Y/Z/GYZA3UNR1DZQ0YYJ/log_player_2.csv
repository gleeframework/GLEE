This is a tough one!  Here's why I'm choosing to accept, even though it's not a great deal:

* **Inflation is hurting:**  The value of the money is going down significantly for me with each round. Waiting longer means I'll get even less.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's consistently rejected offers where she gets less than $57.  There's no guarantee she'll offer me anything better, and waiting could mean getting stuck with a worse deal. 

While $43 isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome as inflation eats away at the potential gains."
