"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but my offer ensures you get something substantial now. With inflation, waiting longer will only hurt you more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
