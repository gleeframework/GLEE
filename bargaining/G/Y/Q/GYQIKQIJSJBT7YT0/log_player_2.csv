Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a little longer.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:**  Bob is losing value at a slower rate (5% per round) than Alice (10% per round). This gives him leverage in later rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** As the rounds progress, Alice will feel more pressure to make a deal, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome for Bob. 

It's a risk, but rejecting this offer and proposing a counter-offer closer to even in the next round is a strategic move."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4875,
""alice_gain"": 5125,
""message"": ""Alice, I agree that we need to settle this quickly. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? It's a win-win before inflation eats away at more of our potential gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a more favorable outcome.  It lands directly in between the two previous offers.
* **Urgency & Fairness:** The message emphasizes the need for a quick resolution due to inflation, framing the offer as a fair solution for both parties. 
* **Future Leverage:**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will be in a strong position to demand a more even split as time pressure increases and her potential gains decrease more rapidly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, and it considers the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, as Alice is clearly feeling the pressure. However, her offer still leans in her favor and she's conceding less than Bob with each round. Here's why rejecting is still the better play:

* **Inflation Still Favors Bob:** While both players are losing money, Alice is losing at a much faster rate. This gives Bob leverage to push for a better split in the coming rounds.
* **Time Pressure Increasing:**  There are only 7 rounds left. While this also puts pressure on Bob, Alice is more likely to make concessions as her potential gains diminish at a faster rate. 
* **Confidence:**  Bob's consistent rejections, coupled with his reasonable counter-offers, indicate he's willing to wait for a more favorable split. This might lead Alice to offer something closer to 50/50 in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and both get something out of this.  A 50/50 split is the fairest solution and avoids further losses for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** After several rounds of negotiation, offering a 50/50 split is a clear and justifiable position. It eliminates any arguments about who is getting a better deal. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the message emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement before inflation further erodes the value of the money.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  While Alice has rejected previous offers, this split is as fair as it gets. The risk of further losses might be enough to encourage her to accept."
