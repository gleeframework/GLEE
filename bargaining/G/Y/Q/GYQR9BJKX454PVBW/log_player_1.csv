I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. I believe this is a fair offer, as I am taking the majority, but I am still willing to share with Bob.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is 10% less for me than his offer last round, I will not accept less than 900,000 for myself in this round.  The money is worth 20% less now, and I need to get a better deal.  I'll see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose a division of 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  I'm willing to drop my share a little bit, but I'm not going to go much lower than this.  The money is worth less each round, and I need to secure a decent amount. Let's see if Bob agrees."
