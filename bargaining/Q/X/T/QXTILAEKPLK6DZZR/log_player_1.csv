"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and keeping the remaining $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get more in this round to compensate for the reduced value. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going into the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
