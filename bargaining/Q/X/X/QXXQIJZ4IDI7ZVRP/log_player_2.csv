"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. The split is too uneven, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Plus, with inflation, the value of the money will decrease, but not as much for Alice as for me, so I'm willing to take the risk.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I've taken the inflation into account. This is a reasonable split.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll see the sense in an almost even split, considering the inflation will hit me harder if we keep going."
