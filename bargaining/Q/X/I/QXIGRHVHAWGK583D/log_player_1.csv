Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive offer in the first round, but I'm trying to secure a large portion of the money early on before the inflation kicks in. I'm willing to risk Bob rejecting this offer, but I believe the potential for a larger gain in the future will be worth it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation hurts my share, it's better to get 1000 now than risk getting nothing at all.  It's likely Bob is trying to be as aggressive as I was in the first round, and we could be stuck in a cycle of rejections. I'm accepting this offer to secure some money before the inflation bites further."
