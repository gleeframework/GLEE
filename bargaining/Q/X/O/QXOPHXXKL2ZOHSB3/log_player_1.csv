"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After weighing the options, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 40% of the original amount, even with the reduced value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding firm on a majority of the remaining amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess this offer. However, I'm not convinced that this is a fair compromise.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 35% share, even with the reduced value due to inflation. I'll wait for another offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
