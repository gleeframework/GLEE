"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original 100$, which is 20$. This leaves me with 80$. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split, but I'm actually hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game quickly!"
