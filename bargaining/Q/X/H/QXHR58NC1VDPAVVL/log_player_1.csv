"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very generous offer to Bob: $1 for him, and the remaining $999,999 for myself. 

This is a strategic move to establish myself as the dominant player in this negotiation.  While it may seem unfair, I believe it sets the stage for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
