"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about any further rounds and the decreasing value of our money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
