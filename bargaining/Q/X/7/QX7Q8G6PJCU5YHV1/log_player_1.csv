"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end this game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so I can get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about your math skills, but my counteroffer should be a lot more appealing for both of us. Let's start with a fair split and see how the rest of the game plays out. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, but I'm not buying it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a fair split, Bob. I'll pass on your offer.""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split and a good opportunity for both of us to get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good amount for myself and giving Bob a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more appealing, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

}
```

I'll hold out for a better offer."

 ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, Bob. We're both getting 50/50, and it's a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time and aim for a 50/50 split."
