"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer favors Alice, and while it's a decent starting point, I believe I can negotiate a better split in later rounds. The threat of inflation makes it risky to wait too long, but I'm willing to gamble for a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split that reflects the risk we both take by continuing. This offer won't be on the table for long due to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has countered with a near-even split, and with inflation eating into the potential gains, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue. Accepting now secures a reasonable sum, even if it's slightly less than what I aimed for initially."
