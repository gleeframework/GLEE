"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 90/10 split, especially considering that my gains are worth 10% less due to inflation. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 60/40 split. It's a fair deal considering the current market conditions""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a compromise considering the inflation rate. I hope Bob will consider this offer."
