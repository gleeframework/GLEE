"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a decent amount considering the inflation will eat away at the value of the money over time. My message is a playful nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we have to deal with.  Let's end this quickly and both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually a 25% decrease from the original $600,000 I proposed in Round 1. Bob's gain of $550,000 is a 10% decrease from the original $600,000 I proposed, but a 37.5% decrease from the original $550,000 he proposed in Round 1.

I'm not sure if this is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'd like to propose a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is a fair split, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. It's time to make a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money. My message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
