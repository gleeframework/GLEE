"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 40-60 and call it a day""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,000 and leaving $6,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you'll still get a decent amount. Consider this a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2,500 is now worth $2,000. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's a decent compromise as Bob said. I'll think about it for a moment...
