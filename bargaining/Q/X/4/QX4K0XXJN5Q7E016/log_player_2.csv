"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while accounting for potential future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 30% share is decent, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There's a lot of time left, and the money is worth less with each round.  Let's see what happens if I propose a different split."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
