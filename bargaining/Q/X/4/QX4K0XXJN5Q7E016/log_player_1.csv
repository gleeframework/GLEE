"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  This is a fair offer given the risks of further rounds and inflation.  Let's finalize this and get the money while it still holds value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
