"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping to create some room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a decent share and avoid the risk of losing money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. I'd rather take the guaranteed split than risk losing more value in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
