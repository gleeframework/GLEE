I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in favor of me, Alice.  I want to start by securing a large portion of the money, knowing that Bob's money is worth less with each round.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me, but I'm not going to let him get away with it!  I'm going to reject his offer.  He's already feeling the sting of inflation, and with each passing round, his money will become even less valuable. I'm going to wait and see what he offers next round, knowing that he's going to need to come back with something more appealing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slight increase from his previous offer, giving him 190,000.  I'm still aiming for a large share of the money, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll recognize that his money is becoming less valuable with each round and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving in!  His offer is still way too low, especially considering how much the money has already depreciated for him.  I'm going to continue to reject his offers until he comes back with something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

This round, I'm going to offer Bob 271,000.  I'm taking a slightly smaller cut than before, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money.  I'm confident that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the rapidly depreciating value of his share.  He knows that he needs to accept an offer soon, and I believe this one will be tempting enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, but his offers are getting closer to what I want. I'm not going to accept this offer though, the inflation is hitting him hard and he'll need to offer me more to get me to agree. I'm confident that I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900} 
```

I'm offering Bob 343,900 this time. This is a significant increase from his last offer, and I believe it reflects the significant value depreciation he's facing.  It's time for him to realize that holding out any longer will only hurt him more.  I'm confident that he will accept this offer, and we can finally end this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still think I can get a better deal. He's clearly feeling the pinch of the inflation, and I'm going to continue to hold out for a more favorable split. I know he needs to settle soon, and I'm going to push for the best outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 590490, ""bob_gain"": 409510}
```

I'm offering Bob 409,510 this round.  The inflation is hitting him hard now, and I'm confident that he'll finally realize he needs to accept a deal. This offer gives him a decent amount, considering the devaluation of his share. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is only a 50/50 split, it's a big improvement from previous offers, and my share is worth more than his. The inflation has been devastating for both of us, and I'm tired of this game.  It's better to get something than nothing. I accept his offer."
