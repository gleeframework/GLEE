"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's get this done and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, as I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the second round, the total amount is now $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle this time. Accept and we can finalize the split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $9,000, which is $4,050, and I'll take the remaining $4,950."
