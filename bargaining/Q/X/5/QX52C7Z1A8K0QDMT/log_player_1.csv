I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly. I'm willing to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unfair, even considering the inflation. I'm not going to accept such a small amount, especially after he rejected my generous offer.  I'll wait for my chance to propose again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

Since Bob rejected my generous offer in round 1 and made a counter-offer that was extremely unfair, I'm reducing my share a bit more. This time I'm offering 85% of the money to myself and 15% to Bob. I hope this time he'll recognize the value of a quick agreement and accept the offer."
