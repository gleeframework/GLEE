"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 40% share, so I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the first to propose!""
}
```

This offer reflects the reduced value of money and gives Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share after rejecting your previous offers! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'm not thrilled about accepting a 23.08% share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of money. I'll have to think about whether I want to accept this offer or risk going to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now! I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to compensate for the decreasing value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3300,
  ""bob_gain"": 6700,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. This is my best offer!""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I think I deserve the majority of the shares. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a fraction of what it was initially! I'm getting desperate, but I don't want to accept an offer that gives me such a small share.

I'll have to think carefully about whether I want to accept this offer or risk going to the next round. However, considering the extreme value of money has decreased, I'll have to accept this offer to salvage what's left.
