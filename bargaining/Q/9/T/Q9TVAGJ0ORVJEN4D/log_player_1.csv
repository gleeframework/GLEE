Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 55% and keep 45%. It's a slightly more generous offer, but I think it's still fair.

While I'm still losing money due to inflation, I've been offered a better deal than my own counter-proposal and the money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round. It's time to stop the inflation and get something out of this."
