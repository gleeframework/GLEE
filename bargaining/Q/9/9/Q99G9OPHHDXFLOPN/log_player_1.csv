"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split that gives me a large share (9000$) and Bob a small share (1000$).  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's better than nothing.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm going to reject it.  The inflation means that his 9000$ is worth more than my 1000$ after the 20% reduction. If I accept now, I'm getting a significantly worse deal than I initially offered. It's risky, but I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly to 8000$, while increasing Bob's share to 2000$. This is still a good deal for me, considering the inflation, and I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of getting something rather than nothing."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder now, I still believe I can get a better deal. The risk of getting nothing is high, but I'm willing to gamble for a larger share.  I'm hoping Bob will eventually realize that he needs to compromise to avoid ending up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite now, so I need to make a more significant concession. I'm dropping my share down to 7000$, hoping Bob will see that it's better to get something rather than risk nothing. I'm willing to accept less, but I still need to secure a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Despite the significant impact of inflation, I believe there's a better deal out there. I'm willing to gamble and see if I can secure a larger share in the next round. While the risk of getting nothing is high, the potential reward is too great to give up on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm still determined to get a decent share of the money. I'm dropping my share down to 6000$, offering Bob a larger portion (4000$). This is a significant concession, but I believe it's necessary to get Bob to accept and avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is extremely high, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm aware that I'm taking a big risk, but I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is clearly aiming for the maximum possible share, and I need to find a way to push for a more equitable split. It's a gamble, but I'm not ready to settle for a deal that feels so unbalanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is it. Inflation has eaten away at my potential gains, and I need to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all.  I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the most equitable solution, considering the circumstances, and I hope Bob will see the sense in it. It's time to put an end to this game."
