"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, it's important to consider the game's dynamics. 

* **Inflation:** Even though we don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's a factor. Waiting a round might make my share worth more.
* **Power Shift:** Rejecting gives me control in the next round. I can propose a split that benefits me more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of getting nothing is real, but the potential reward of a better deal in the next round is worth the gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a more balanced split is necessary. Let's try 60/40 this time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you agree. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While inflation hasn't hit me yet, it's clearly affecting Alice. This puts me in a stronger position.
* **Shifting Power:**  Alice's offer is more favorable than my previous offer. It's a good compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of waiting another round is high. The potential reward of a slightly better deal is not worth the risk of getting nothing. 

This offer gives me a good chunk of the money and avoids further risk of reaching the final rounds with no agreement."
