"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount to start with, and I'm keeping $70 for myself. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth $45.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 50-50 split is a fair one, but I was hoping to get a bit more. Since Bob is offering a fair split, I'll accept this offer.
