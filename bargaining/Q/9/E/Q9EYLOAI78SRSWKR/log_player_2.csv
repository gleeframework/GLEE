Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is becoming the safer option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us.  Alice is experiencing a much faster rate of loss. 
* **Time:** We're past the halfway point. If we continue to the later rounds, the gains for both of us will be significantly eroded. 
* **Future Offers:**  Alice might be getting desperate and offer even less favorable terms in future rounds as she sees her potential gains dwindle.

It's a tough choice, but at this point, accepting a 45/55 split is better than risking getting a much smaller amount or even nothing if the game goes to the final rounds."
