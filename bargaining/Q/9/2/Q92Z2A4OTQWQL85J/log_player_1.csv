"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer. Let's go with 550/450.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 450,000 x 0.95 = 427,500
Bob gain: 550,000 x 0.95 = 522,500

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
