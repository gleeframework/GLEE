"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal that lets us both walk away with a good chunk of money.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
It's not a terrible offer, but I can probably do better as the game goes on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""How about we go 55/45?  It's still a good deal for you, and a little better for me.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This back and forth isn't helping anyone. Let's just split it evenly and avoid losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, the longer this goes on the less we both get.  An even split is a fair deal."
