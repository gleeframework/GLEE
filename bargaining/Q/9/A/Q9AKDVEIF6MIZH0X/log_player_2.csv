Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Take it before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 700,000 for myself, but I think we need to reach an agreement soon. The inflation is hurting my share more and more.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, the inflation is taking a toll on your share. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger cut. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is lower than what I initially proposed, the inflation is severely impacting my share. Accepting this offer at least guarantees me some gain, unlike continuing the game, which might lead to zero gain for me due to the increasing inflation."
