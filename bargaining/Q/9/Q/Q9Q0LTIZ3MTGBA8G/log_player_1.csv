"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to keep him engaged, while I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 4500 * 0.8 = 3600
* Bob's gain: 5500 * 0.8 = 4400

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
