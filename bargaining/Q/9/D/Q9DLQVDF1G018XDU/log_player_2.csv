Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal. Let's wrap this up before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round, Bob's potential gains decrease significantly due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is losing money each round. She is unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this, especially as she gets closer to the end of the game and a potential win. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing if Alice refuses to budge further.

While not ideal, accepting a slightly worse split now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum rather than risking a much smaller amount or even nothing at all."
