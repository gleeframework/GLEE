"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 60-40! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 3000$ is now worth 2400$ (since 20% less than 3000), and Bob's gain of 7000$ is worth 6650$ (since 5% less than 7000).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like a bit more. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and suggesting that Bob should consider giving me a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so my gain is now worth 80% of 2400$, which is 1920$. Bob's gain is worth 5% less than 6650$, which is 6305$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than this. Let's see if you agree!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think I've been generous enough already! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 4500$ is now worth 2334$ (since 48.8% less than 4500), and Bob's gain of 5500$ is worth 4715$ (since 14.26% less than 5500).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I think I can do better. I'm not ready to settle for this yet!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so my gain is now worth 1870.8% of 2334$, which is 466.96$. However, since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, I'll simplify the calculation and just multiply 2334$ by 0.8 to get 1869.12$. Bob's gain is worth 5% less than 4715$, which is 4481.25.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority, but I need something for myself. Let's finalize this!""
}
```"
