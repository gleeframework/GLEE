Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get closer to a fair split. I'm willing to go down to 65/35, but I'm not going any lower. This is a good deal for both of us, especially with the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
