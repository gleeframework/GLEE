"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants a 60/40 split. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 60% of the pie. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking forward to making a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will find it more acceptable this time around!"
