"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I think it's unfair that I'm getting $4,000 while Bob is getting $6,000. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not giving up too much""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a bigger share of the pie, but still keeping some of the value for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The gap between our gains is getting too wide, and I'm not comfortable with giving up so much more value. I was hoping for a more balanced split, but it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much more""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground again, offering a slightly bigger share to Bob, but still keeping some value for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
