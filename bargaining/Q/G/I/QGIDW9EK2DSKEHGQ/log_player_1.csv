I propose a 51/49 split in my favor, as a slight advantage for the first proposer is generally considered fair in these types of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I believe a more even split is fair, considering the inflation that has occurred."
