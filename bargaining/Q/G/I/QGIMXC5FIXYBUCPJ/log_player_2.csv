# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling generous. I'll take the same split you offered me last round, but with me getting the larger share. It's a deal you can't refuse! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

I'm offering you a 60/40 split, which is better than what we'll likely get if we keep rejecting each other's offers. It's time to end this game and secure some value before we lose more.""}
