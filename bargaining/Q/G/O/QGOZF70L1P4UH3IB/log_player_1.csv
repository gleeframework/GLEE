"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a relatively even split, with a slight bias in my favor to account for the fact that the money loses value faster for me. The message is a simple appeal to fairness, hoping that Bob will see the reasonableness of the offer and accept it, ending the game quickly before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money decreases with each round, accepting 400,000 in the second round, which is worth 20% less than the original amount, seems less favorable compared to potentially gaining more in the next round, even considering the inflation. Let's proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better split.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nMy next offer would be:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI propose an equal split, hoping that Bob will see the compromise as a fair solution, considering we both lose value with each passing round. This approach aims to find a middle ground, emphasizing the mutual loss due to inflation and the benefit of concluding the negotiation sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nAs previously planned, I'll stick with the strategy to propose an equal split. Given the decreasing value of money for both of us, meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable and fair solution that might appeal to Bob, considering the ongoing loss of value and the potential for further loss if we continue negotiating. This approach shows willingness to compromise and aims to conclude the negotiation in a mutually acceptable manner."
