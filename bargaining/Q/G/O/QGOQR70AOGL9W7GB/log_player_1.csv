"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In terms of the ""real"" value of the money, Bob's offer is effectively a 40-60 split, which is still quite skewed towards Bob.

I'll reject this offer.

However, I still think I can do better than a 30-70 split. I'll reject this offer.
