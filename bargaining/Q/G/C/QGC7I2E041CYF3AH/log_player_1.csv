"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that Alice gets $95 and Bob gets $5. This ensures that I secure the majority of the money in the first round and avoids the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
