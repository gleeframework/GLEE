"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think we can do better than 80-20. How about a 60-40 split? It's a more balanced deal, and we both get a good share.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a better deal, 70-30. It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less now, it's still a better deal than the 60-40 split I proposed.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to take it."
