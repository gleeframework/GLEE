"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $2000 and keep $8000 for myself. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion of the initial amount, but still a decent chunk, to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent deal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll be getting $7200 if I accept this offer.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
