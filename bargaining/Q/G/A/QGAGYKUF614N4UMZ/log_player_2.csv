"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999999 and let you have 1, but next round I'll get 999999900, so you'd better agree! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems tempting, I'm not going to accept it. The potential gain of 999,999,900 in the next round is too high to ignore. I'm confident I can secure a better deal for myself in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. This offer ensures you still get a significant share, and it gives me a comfortable head start.  We can negotiate further in the coming rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a decent starting share, but my next offer will be even better for you. We can split it more evenly later on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still not enough. Alice is using the threat of a better offer in the next round to manipulate me.  I'm going to hold out and see what she really has to offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This offer is a fair split, and it allows us to both benefit without risking further losses from inflation.""}
