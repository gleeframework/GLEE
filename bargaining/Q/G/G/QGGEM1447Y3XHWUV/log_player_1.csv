"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my initial offer.  I'm taking almost everything, but I'm leaving Bob with a token amount just in case he's feeling generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a much better deal for me than rejecting and playing another round. While my gains are worth less due to inflation, the money Bob gains is worth the same, so he has no incentive to play another round."
