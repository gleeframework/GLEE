Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll make a slight concession, but I still think I should get the bigger share due to the inflation difference 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making small concessions, the deal is still not favorable to Bob considering the rapid inflation working against him.  He needs to push for a more significant shift in his favor soon or he risks getting a much worse deal as time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this drags on.""}

**Reasoning:**

The rapidly increasing inflation for Bob makes it crucial to secure a deal quickly. A 50/50 split, while not ideal, becomes the most rational choice.  This offer:

* **Is simple and clear:**  ""Take it or leave it"" leaves no room for misinterpretation.
* **Highlights the shared risk:** Reminding Alice they both lose emphasizes the urgency. 
* **Establishes a firm stance:**  Bob shows he's serious and won't be pushed much further.

Past this point, the inflation makes any potential gains for Bob increasingly negligible, making it riskier to continue haggling."
