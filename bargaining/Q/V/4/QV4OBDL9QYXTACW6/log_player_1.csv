"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This allows for a significant gain for me while still offering a decent amount to Bob.  It's a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  My share is significantly smaller than my initial offer, but the inflation rate on Bob's gain means he is losing a large portion of his potential income.  This is a gamble on my part, but it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will make a more favorable offer to himself in the next round, leaving me with even less."
