"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly. I am taking a slight loss to ensure we both benefit. This offer won't last long! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems enticing at first,  it's important to consider the implications of the inflation.  By rejecting, Bob forces Alice to make a new offer in round 2, where the money will be worth less for her and potentially more for him.  It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a fair split.  Accept this and we both get something substantial.  Reject and we both lose more with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you drive a hard bargain but let's be reasonable.  I'm taking a bigger hit to get this done. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a very lopsided deal, even with the inflation.  Bob is better off waiting and seeing if Alice will be willing to come closer to an even split. Each round is decreasing the value of her money more than his.  He needs to keep the pressure on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer to the end. It's time to be realistic. This offer gives us both a significant share.  Accept and we both benefit. Reject and we both risk losing much more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant loss to avoid us both getting nothing.  Let's be practical and end this here! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get a much larger share, even with the increasing inflation hitting her harder. Bob needs to push for a fairer deal. He's not getting a good deal with this offer. It's important to hold out and see if she's willing to compromise further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a fair compromise considering the current situation.  Accept and we both get a reasonable share.  Reject and we risk losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking!  This is my final offer, take it or leave it. I'd rather lose something than everything! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency, the offer is still very lopsided.  With each passing round, Alice's losses are increasing significantly due to inflation.  Bob should continue to hold out for a more equitable split.  His patience is paying off as Alice's offers are getting more reasonable with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is our last chance. We're both losing more with every round. This offer is the closest to fairness we can get now. Let's end this and get something rather than nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: BOB! STOP THIS MADNESS!! We're about to lose EVERYTHING! This is my absolute LAST offer. Take it or we BOTH get NOTHING! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's desperation is understandable, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor. Even with the heavy inflation hitting her, she's trying to get a huge share. Bob has the upper hand now. He should push for a better deal or risk everything in the remaining rounds. He's shown patience and that's paying off."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, the time is now.  We're both on the brink.  Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something.  Reject, and we both get nothing. It's time to compromise.""}
