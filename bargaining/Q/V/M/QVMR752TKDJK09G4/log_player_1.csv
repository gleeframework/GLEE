"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is more balanced than mine, I'm confident I can do better. I'll take the risk and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer, but I'm going to make it a bit more favorable to myself. The inflation rate will hurt Bob more than me, so I'm hoping this will be enough to sway him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal considering the inflation rate. It's a fair split and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round."
