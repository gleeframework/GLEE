  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! Accept and we can move on.""

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

I reject Bob's offer. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I want a bigger share, let's try again!""
}
```"

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer.

Splitting it evenly might not be the best option for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
