"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round. By offering her 40 dollars, I'm hoping she'll consider it a better option than waiting for the next round, where her potential gain might be worth even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Alice is experiencing a 19% decrease in the value of her potential gain, which might motivate her to accept a slightly lower offer in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk to see if I can get a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your gain, I think this is a fair adjustment.""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth even less for Alice, now 19% less than in the first round. I'm hoping that she'll be more inclined to accept this offer, as the potential gain, although lower, is still worth more now than it might be in subsequent rounds."
