Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get most of the money, but still offer Bob something so he might accept.  It's the first round, and the money isn't worth much less yet, so I'm taking a big cut."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, 800,000 is still a good amount of money. With inflation, Bob's offer is likely worth less to him than it was to me in the first round, so I don't think he will reject it."
