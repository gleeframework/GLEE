"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what happens if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This offer is more equitable, and we can both still walk away with a good chunk of the money.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's a decent split considering the inflation, and waiting longer only hurts us both. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's not my ideal split, it's better than what I was offered in the first round after inflation.  I'm not confident I can do better in the next round and it seems like Alice is serious about this being her final offer."
