It's a tough decision, but Alice is clearly sticking to her principles. She has rejected every offer where she gets less than a third of the money, and she's likely to stick to her guns even in this final round. 

This game highlights the tension between the desire for a ""fair"" outcome and the reality of a shrinking pie. Even though Alice is losing a significant amount due to inflation, she's prioritizing getting at least a reasonable share. This demonstrates that sometimes, even a small gain is better than nothing, but it also shows the power of principle and the potential for stubbornness to lead to a negative outcome for both parties."
