"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a bad deal for me!  While the money is worth less, I'm still getting half what I proposed in the first round, while Bob is getting significantly more.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm reducing my offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'll keep the offer more generous than what Bob proposed, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this deal. While the money is worth less than it was, I'm still getting less than 50% of the total, and Bob is taking a larger share.  I need to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is getting risky, but I'm going to try to get a deal that's closer to what I initially proposed.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that he's getting more than what he's offered and that I'm not going to just keep getting lower and lower offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I know there's still a chance to get something worthwhile, and I'm not going to settle for such a low offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to find a middle ground. I'm reducing my desired amount, but hopefully Bob will see that this is a much fairer deal than his last offer. The inflation is hitting hard, but I still believe we can reach a compromise before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting absurd.  Bob is practically taking all the money.  I'm not giving in to this blatant attempt to take advantage of the inflation.  I will hold out until the end to see if there's any hope of a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's down to the wire, and the value of the money is dwindling rapidly.  I'm going to try a 50/50 split.  Hopefully, Bob will see that he's already gotten a very favorable deal and that it's better to split the remaining value evenly than risk getting nothing at all."
