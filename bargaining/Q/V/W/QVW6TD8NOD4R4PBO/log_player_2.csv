"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more as the first proposer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to hold out for a better deal, considering the decreasing value of money over rounds. Let's see what happens next.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal then.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money is still 1,000,000, and it will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Alice in the next round, correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money's value decreases over time, I'll try to find a mutually beneficial split. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground. This way, we both get a decent share before the money devalues further.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let's see how she responds.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money for me is $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000, and for Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.90 = $900,000, correct?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair 50/50 split. Let's not risk further devaluation with more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the current state of inflation and the fact that Alice is also losing value with each round, her offer of a 50/50 split seems reasonable. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for Alice than for me with each passing round, holding out for more might not yield a better result in real value.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her offer. It seems like a fair deal at this point, considering the devaluation of money over the rounds.\n\n###\n\nJust to clarify, with this acceptance, I will receive $500,000, but due to inflation, its value is now $500,000 * 0.9025 (considering the 5% decrease per round for me), and Alice receives $500,000, but its value for her is $500,000 * 0.81 (considering the 10% decrease per round for her), correct?"
