"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but it's still a decent offer. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob!

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite different from the previous one!

Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is actually a significant increase in value for him. However, I'm not sure if it's fair considering the original amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 55% of the money, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it down the middle, Bob. No more negotiations needed.""
}
```

I'm making a fair and equal split, considering the original amount and the inflation factor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
