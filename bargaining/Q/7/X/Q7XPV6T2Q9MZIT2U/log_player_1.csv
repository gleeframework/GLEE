"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to test the waters""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still cautious 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25
