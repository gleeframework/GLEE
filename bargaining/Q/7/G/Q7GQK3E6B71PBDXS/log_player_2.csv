**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation but she's also feeling the pressure.  We need to make her a better offer soon or she'll run us out of rounds, but not yet."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split.  The inflation is only getting worse for both of us.  Let's end this now and both get something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to make a strong move to break the stalemate. A 50/50 split is fair and emphasizes the shrinking pot.  This might be the push Alice needs to settle."
