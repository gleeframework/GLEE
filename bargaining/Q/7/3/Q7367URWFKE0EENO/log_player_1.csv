Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk I'm taking by letting the money depreciate. This way we both benefit from a quicker resolution. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
