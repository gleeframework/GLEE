"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both make a little more than last time. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than $4,000. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of $6,000, which is $4,860.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leave $5,500 for Bob."
