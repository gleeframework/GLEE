Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding out for a larger share, but I'm willing to drop my demand slightly.  Let's go with 75/25 this time.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's find a compromise soon.

# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with the rounds progressing, accepting 25% when we started at a 10% offer from Alice means she's dictating the terms.  We've shown willingness to negotiate, but accepting now might encourage her to push for an even smaller share in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. We both lose with every round that passes. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time pressure:**  With only 7 rounds left, the pressure is on. A firm stance is necessary.
* **Inflation disadvantage:** Alice is feeling the inflation more acutely.  Delaying further hurts her more than me.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair.  By framing it this way, I'm appealing to her sense of reason and highlighting the losses incurred by continued negotiation.
* **Ultimatum (Take it or leave it):** This signals that I'm serious and unlikely to budge much further. It might push her to accept before the potential losses outweigh her desire for a larger share."
