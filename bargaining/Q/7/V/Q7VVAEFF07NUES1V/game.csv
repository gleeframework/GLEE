9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  Let's see if we can work something out!,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"That's a very generous offer, Alice, but how about we go 60/40 in the name of fairness?",Bob,2,

8000.0,2000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share. Let's go with 80/20 this time. If you reject this, we'll be in a stalemate and both lose money with each passing round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Okay, Alice, I see your point.  How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?  It's closer to your offer, but gives us both a more even split.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"I'm still holding out for a larger share, but I'm willing to drop my demand slightly.  Let's go with 75/25 this time.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's find a compromise soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. We both lose with every round that passes. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
