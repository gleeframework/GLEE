**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now reasonable considering the circumstances. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Alice is losing value with each round that passes, making her more likely to agree to a deal closer to even.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiations doesn't benefit me since my potential gains remain static.  
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. It's possible her offers could even become less favorable. 

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a worse outcome later."
