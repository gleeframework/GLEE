"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively even split considering the total amount is 100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're being too generous, Alice. I'll take 60 and leave you with 40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to reassess the offer.

Since my gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I should be more cautious. However, I still need to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in round 2.

Considering the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a more aggressive split than the previous round but still a compromise."
