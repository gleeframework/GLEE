"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal of:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This time, I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, but I'll have to keep in mind that the money is worth 40% of its original value for me now."
