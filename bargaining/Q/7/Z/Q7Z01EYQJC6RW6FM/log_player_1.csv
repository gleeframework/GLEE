"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 is a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth less now. I was hoping to get a better deal in the early rounds. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still think I deserve more. 55-45 is a good compromise.""}

I'm trying to get a better deal by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, while still being reasonable and giving him a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think 58-42 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 58-42 split, especially since the money is worth even less now. I was hoping to get a better deal, and I'm not convinced that 42% is a good share for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think 50-50 is a bit generous. Can we try 52-48 instead?""}

I'm trying to find a compromise again, but this time I'm willing to give a slightly better deal to Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept a 2% difference in our shares."
