"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, Bob is being offered a significantly smaller share of the money compared to Alice. Given that the money's value decreases with each round, it might seem beneficial to accept any offer early on. However, since Bob has 12 rounds to negotiate and the depreciation rate is higher for him (10%) than for Alice (5%), he has more to lose from not negotiating a better deal. Accepting the first offer without trying to negotiate a better share, especially when Alice indicates a willingness to negotiate, might not be the best strategy. Bob should try to propose a more favorable division in the next round, hoping to maximize his gain before the money's value drops significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle. We both lose if we don't find a balance.""}\n\nReasoning: Given that Alice initially proposed a division that significantly favored her but expressed a willingness to negotiate, Bob should take this opportunity to propose a more balanced division. By suggesting a split that is closer to equal but still slightly favors Alice, Bob is attempting to find a compromise that acknowledges Alice's initial stance while also improving his own position. The message emphasizes the mutual loss if no agreement is reached, aiming to encourage Alice to consider the offer seriously."
