I'm going to be greedy and start with a big offer for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, since even with the inflation, it's still a decent chunk of money for him.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair deal considering the inflation.  I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to lose 20% of my potential earnings. Let's take this and move on."
