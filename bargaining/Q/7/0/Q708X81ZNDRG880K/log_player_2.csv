"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While the division seems reasonable, the money is worth more to me if I can make a counter offer and get a larger share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 6:4 split in my favor.  We can both still get a significant portion of the money, and the decreasing value makes this a fair compromise.""}
