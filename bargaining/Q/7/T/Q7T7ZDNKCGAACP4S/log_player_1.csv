Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer in this range. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I accept."" 
}

Even though it's slightly less than my offer, accepting ensures I get something substantial before inflation eats away at the value further."
