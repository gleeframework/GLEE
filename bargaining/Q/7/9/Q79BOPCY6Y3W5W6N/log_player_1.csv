"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd rather take a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still eating away at the value of the money, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I need a bit more to make it worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, but I need a better deal than the last offer.  Let's find a split we can both agree on. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer.
