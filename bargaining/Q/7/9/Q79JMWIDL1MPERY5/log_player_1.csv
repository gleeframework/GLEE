"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. This is a relatively fair split, considering I'm making the first offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. Can we settle on this one? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $60 is actually worth $57.60.

I'm not sure I'm happy with this offer, considering I could potentially get a better deal later on. I'll reject this offer and let Bob know:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm hoping for a better deal. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, my gain of $70 in the first round is now worth $66.50. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split, but I'm still hoping you'll try to do better!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, Alice! I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Can we make a deal? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $65 in the third round is now worth $55.83, which is even less than the $55 Bob is offering in this round.

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is actually a good one, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've convinced me! I'll take this deal. Thanks for the negotiation!""
}
```"
