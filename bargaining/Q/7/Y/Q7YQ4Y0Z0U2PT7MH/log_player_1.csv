"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This offer gives Alice a 90% share and Bob a 10% share. It's a significant advantage for Alice, but it's a starting point. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very unfair and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the proposed division.  I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a 20% share, which is a significant increase from his previous offer, but still provides me with a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor.  I'm not willing to accept such a low share, even with the decreasing value of the money.  I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a 30% share, hoping to find a compromise.  The money is losing value, and I'm trying to be realistic.  It's a significant concession from my previous offers, but I believe it's still reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too unfavorable to me. While the money is losing value, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, hoping to find a compromise. We're both losing money due to inflation, so I'm trying to be flexible but still maintain a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too unfair.  I'm determined to get a better deal, even though we're both losing money.  I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

With only a few rounds remaining, I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Hopefully, Bob will finally accept and we can both walk away with something."
