"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll consider the actual amounts: I'll get $10 and Bob will get $90.

I'll reject this offer. It's not a good deal for me. I want a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 90% of the original amount, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'll take 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll consider the actual amounts: I'll get $20 and Bob will get $80. 

This is a slightly better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's a better deal than Bob's offer in Round 2. I'll accept this offer.
