"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can adjust things in the future if you prefer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's wiser to see if I can get a better deal later. The inflation will work against me in later rounds, so I need to secure a more substantial share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
