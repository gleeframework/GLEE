"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, Alice. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my decision accordingly.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually worse for me than my initial offer. In the first round, I was offered $60, which was worth 100%. Now, with 5% inflation, $60 is worth 95% of its original value. But Bob's offer is $40, which is worth 90% of its original value, due to 10% inflation.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob! Let's try again. My turn!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing that Bob gets 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and I'll take the remaining 45%, which is $45. My message is a bit cheeky, trying to get Bob to reconsider his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. No more fighting! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less each round!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $50 is worth 85.74% of its original value. That's $42.87.

Bob's gain of $50 is worth 72.9% of its original value. That's $36.45.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer. I'll accept it.
