"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll make an offer that I think is reasonable. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is closer to my initial proposal, but still not as favorable to me, I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Alice's money is worth 21% less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of this.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I think there's a mistake in the inflation calculation. The money Alice gains is worth 19% less in round 3, and 34.39% less in round 5, which is not possible. The inflation rate should be consistent.

Assuming the correct inflation rate is still 10% per round, the money Alice gains in round 5 is worth 71% of its original value, which is 71% of 100 = 71.

My offer in round 4 was 65, which is a good offer considering the inflation. Alice's offer in round 5 is 60, which is not as good as my previous offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Alice's money is worth 71% of its original value, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll keep pushing for a better deal.

Alice's offer is not significantly different from my previous offer, and considering the inflation, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Alice's money is worth 46.86% of its original value, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","The game is getting intense! Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Alice's money is worth 56.95% of its original value, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
