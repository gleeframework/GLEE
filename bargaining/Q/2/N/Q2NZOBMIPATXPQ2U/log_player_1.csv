I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split.  I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm willing to give Bob a bit of a head start. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is a bit too much in his favor. I'll reject and see what he comes up with next.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 600,000 - 400,000 split.  While Bob's offer was tempting, I think a 60/40 split is more fair, especially considering how much the money has depreciated."
