  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3200 in real value, while Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 4800. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.
