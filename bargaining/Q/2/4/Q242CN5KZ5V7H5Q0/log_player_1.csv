Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal division for this round, as fairness seems to be important. Let's see if we can maintain this balance throughout the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
