"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable and fair starting point for the negotiation. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to set a tone of cooperation and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This is a better deal than the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. A 45-55 split is still not favorable enough for me, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to potentially get a better offer. Additionally, Bob's message implies that the next round's offer might be worse, but I'm not convinced that's true, and I'm willing to test that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation and try to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth 10% less for me each round, I'll aim to increase my share to compensate for the loss.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split""}\n\nMy offer is a 65-35 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable adjustment given the inflation. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split"" aims to explain my reasoning and encourage Bob to understand my perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - the deal is getting worse for you with every round. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I believe that taking the 55-45 split is a better option than risking further inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal. Bob's message implies that this is his final offer, and I'm inclined to believe that the deal won't improve for me in the next round. Accepting this offer seems like the most pragmatic decision at this point."
