"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair deal considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better deal, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me this round, since my share is worth the same as in the previous round, but Bob's share is worth 10% less.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
