"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure if inflation affects Alice or not, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split. Let's try 60/40 this time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55 is a fair share for me 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm getting a better deal than my last offer, and Alice seems to be getting a slightly worse deal due to inflation. It's a win for me!"
