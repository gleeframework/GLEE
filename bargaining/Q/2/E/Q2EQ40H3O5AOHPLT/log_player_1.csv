"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This leaves me with $80, which is a fair share considering the inflation will be less harsh for me in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll think about it for a moment...
