"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested in negotiating.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a relatively equal split. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to negotiate and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. It's fair and gives us both a good amount to start with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,000 I proposed in the first round, which is $6,400. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not getting as much as I initially proposed, but I'm still getting a decent amount.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of the original $8,000 I proposed in the first round, which is $5,120. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```"
