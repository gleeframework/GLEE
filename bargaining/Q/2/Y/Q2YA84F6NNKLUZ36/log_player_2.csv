"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested in negotiating. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $2000, it's a very small amount of the total. There's a chance Alice might be overestimating how much I need to be incentivized, and I can likely get more by rejecting and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. It's fair and gives us both a good amount to start with.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair split considering the current value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like a larger share, Alice's offer is a significant improvement from her previous offer. Considering the inflation affecting her side, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and further negotiation might risk getting nothing."
