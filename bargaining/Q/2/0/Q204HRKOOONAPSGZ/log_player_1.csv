"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split. Accept and let's move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split and encouraging him to accept. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share this time. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, slightly in my favor. Let's end this before the money's worth nothing!""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a middle ground, while still getting a slightly larger share. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in ending the game soon to minimize the impact of inflation."
