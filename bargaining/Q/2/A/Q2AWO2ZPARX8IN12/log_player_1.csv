"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money. Since I know about the inflation, I want to get as much as possible early on before the value diminishes. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I know that the inflation will continue to work against me, but I'm willing to gamble that Bob will eventually concede to a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced, recognizing that I need to compromise to reach a deal. With inflation continuing, I'm aiming for a split that feels more equitable while still leaving room for negotiation."
