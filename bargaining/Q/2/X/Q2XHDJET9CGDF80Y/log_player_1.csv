"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll take 70 and you get 30. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but let's not give away too much at once 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks I'm fair, but wants to keep more for himself!

Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45 (due to 10% inflation)
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40 (due to 20% inflation)

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'd be getting less than I initially proposed in Round 1. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a larger share. What do you say?""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50/50 split Bob proposed earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting!

Let's calculate the actual values:

* My gain: 40 * 0.727 (10% * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.9) = 29.08 (due to 10% inflation in each round)
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.516 (20% * 0.8 * 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.9) = 30.96 (due to 20% inflation in each round)

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'd be getting less than I initially proposed in Round 1, and the inflation is really eating into the value of the money. However, it's not a bad offer, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
