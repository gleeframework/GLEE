  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. 

```

}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come up with an even better proposal in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! A fair split for both of us.""
}
```

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time around! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise, considering the reduced value of the money."
