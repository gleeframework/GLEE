"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I believe I deserve a slightly larger share. I'm offering you 40%, hoping for a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob's offer is identical to mine in the first round! I'm not going to fall for that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a 20% toll on my potential gains, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, Bob. But I think this is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
