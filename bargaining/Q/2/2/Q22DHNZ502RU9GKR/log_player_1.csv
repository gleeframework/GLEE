Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, as I'm the one making the proposal and I want to maximize my share. I'm not too greedy though, as I want to ensure Bob will accept the offer and we can both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
