"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $10,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is a 70% share, which is a significant increase from his previous rejection of my 60% offer, I'll consider it a relatively good deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
