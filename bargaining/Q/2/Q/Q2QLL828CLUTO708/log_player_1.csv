"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping this is a good starting point, and Bob can try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1. I'll take more this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42% share for myself and 58% for Bob, hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the amount. You can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal this time, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger. I need a bigger share to keep up with the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55% share for myself and 45% for Bob, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle... again. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to stick to his original idea. However, considering the rapid inflation, I'd rather not accept this offer. The money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal this time, considering the rapid inflation. Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, but I'm not going to give up on getting more. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50% share for myself and 50% for Bob, hoping to get a fair deal before the value of the money drops even further."
