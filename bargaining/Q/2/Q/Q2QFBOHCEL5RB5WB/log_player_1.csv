"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me a bit. I figure it's a good starting point, and Bob might be inclined to accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than the one I made, and since we both know inflation is happening, there's no reason for me to accept. I'll propose a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time.  With inflation kicking in, it's important to find a compromise. I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the inflation is making it more and more risky for me to accept.  I'll counter with a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly.  I'm still trying to be fair, but the inflation is making it harder to get a good deal. I'm hoping this offer is good enough for Bob to accept, or we're both going to lose a lot of money in the long run."
