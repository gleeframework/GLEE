Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a bit more balanced.  Let's get started dividing the money before it loses too much value! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
