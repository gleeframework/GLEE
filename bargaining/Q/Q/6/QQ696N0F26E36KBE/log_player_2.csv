"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 19% less, the actual amounts I'll get are:

* 70 (initially proposed) * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 56.7
* 40 (proposed by Alice) * 0.81 = 32.4

Alice's offer is actually a bit more favorable to her than my initial offer, but I'll still reject it since I'm hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 19% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 56, ""alice_gain"": 44}"
