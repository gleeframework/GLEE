Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money being worth 67.23% less in Round 6, I'll have to be very careful.

However, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is a tempting one. I'll accept his offer:

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
