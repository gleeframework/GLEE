"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! This is a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a straightforward one - I'm trying to make a good first impression and get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

My gain in this round would be $300,000, but it's worth 10% less than the $900,000 I could have gotten in the first round. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 20% less than the $1,000,000 he could have gotten in the first round.

I think I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my offer will be a bit more aggressive this time. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob. I'll take this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, trying to convey that I'm not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. Don't think you can outlast me! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain in this round would be $450,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the $900,000 I could have gotten in the first round. That's a significant hit.

Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 48.8% less than the $1,000,000 he could have gotten in the first round, but it's still a substantial amount.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better deal. However, I'm running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

After considering the numbers, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my offer will be even more aggressive this time. I'll try to get a better deal before the money becomes even less valuable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $500,000 and keeping $500,000 for myself. The message is a bit more conciliatory, trying to convey that I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."
