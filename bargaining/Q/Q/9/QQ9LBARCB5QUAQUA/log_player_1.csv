"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000 and giving Bob 40%. I'm hoping this is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I proposed a 60% share, which was $600,000. With 10% inflation, that's now worth 90% of $600,000, which is $540,000.

Bob's offer in this round is $300,000, which is a significant reduction from the $400,000 I initially offered him. However, considering the inflation, $300,000 is now worth the same as $300,000 was in the first round, which is 30% of the original $1,000,000.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up 30% of the original amount, especially since I'm getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'm now in a stronger position, and I'll try to take a larger share. However, I'll still try to be reasonable and leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a good deal!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking 42% of the original $1,000,000, which is a bit more than my initial 40% offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I proposed a 60% share, which was $600,000. With 27.1% inflation, that's now worth 72.9% of $600,000, which is approximately $437,400.

Bob's offer in this round is $450,000, which is a bit more than the $437,400 I calculated as my fair share. Considering the inflation, $450,000 is still worth the same as $450,000 was in the first round, which is 45% of the original $1,000,000.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up 55% of the original amount, especially since I'm getting a smaller share due to inflation. However, Bob's offer is closer to my calculated fair share, and I'm starting to get worried that I might not get a better offer.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
