"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll get $50 and Bob will get $50."
