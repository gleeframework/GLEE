"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the money and the message I'd like to pass to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable from the start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, hoping he'll see the fairness in this initial offer and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous with this offer, but we need to find a way to maximize our gains.  Let's work together and see if we can find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm making a compromise. Let's settle this before the money loses more value.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer slightly, taking into account the devaluation of the money, but still aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob."
