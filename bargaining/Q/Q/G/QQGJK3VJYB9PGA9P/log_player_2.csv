"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split it 60/40. I believe it's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to find a balance that benefits me while still being reasonable for Alice.\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more suitable split. It's still a good deal for both of us, but it reflects the changing value of the money.""}\n\nLet me know Alice's response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option given the current inflation rates. It ensures we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the current inflation rates and the fact that the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, I think a 50/50 split is actually a great deal for me.\n\nSince Alice is losing more value due to inflation, I believe she is more motivated to close the deal, and I can take advantage of that.\n\nHowever, considering the offer itself, it's a straight 50/50 split, which seems fair given the circumstances.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's close the deal!"
