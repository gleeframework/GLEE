"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. You can try to do better next round, but I'm not budging much!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less, so I need to be even more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'm not getting a good enough deal, and I'd like to try to get a better offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, Bob. I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept. Take it or leave it!""

# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less, and I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I don't want to give in too easily, so I'll reject Bob's offer.
