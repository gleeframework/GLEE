I'm going to try and take most of the money in the first round. I'm hoping Bob doesn't understand how inflation works, or is too greedy to accept a small offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep more, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get if I reject and risk him getting even greedier in the next round.  I'm hoping the 20% inflation will hurt him more than it would hurt me, even though it seems small at this point."
