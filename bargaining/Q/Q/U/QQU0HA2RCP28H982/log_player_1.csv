"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, but I'm willing to work towards a more even split later if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is more even, the devaluation of the money for me is too steep. I'm still hoping for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be a fair split.  Let's find a middle ground.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  We both have a stake in making sure this game doesn't end with us getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With the inflation rate, I'm unlikely to get a better offer. It's time to secure something, even if it's not ideal."
