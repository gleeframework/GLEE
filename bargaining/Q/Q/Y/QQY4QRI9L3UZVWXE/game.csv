70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. It's best to settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Come on, Alice! I think 60-40 is a much fairer deal. You still get a significant amount, and we both avoid losing value to inflation.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be real. Inflation is hurting me more each round.  I'll take $65, you take $35.  It's better than what you offered last round and saves us both from further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I see you're feeling the pinch of inflation, but I still think I can do better than your last offer. How about 58 for me and 42 for you? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm offering you $40, which is more than you'd get if we wait any longer.  Take it or leave it. This is my final offer.",Alice,5,
