I'm Bob, and I want to try and get a better deal.  Let's see if I can negotiate a more favorable split!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm offering you 4000, and I'll take the rest.  Let's see if this works for you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You wanted more, I want more too. Let's try this 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm willing to accept this offer. While I'd still prefer a larger share, inflation is impacting my potential gains significantly, and it's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
