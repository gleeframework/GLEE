This offer gives you a large share of the money, hoping to entice Bob to accept it early and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what Bob does!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm reducing my demand a bit, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before the inflation further diminishes my gains."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm hoping that Bob will eventually realize that I'm not willing to settle for such a low share."

I'm adjusting my offer again. The inflation is severe, but I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and ensuring Bob doesn't get too greedy."

Despite the significant inflation impact, I am still rejecting this offer. Bob is becoming increasingly greedy, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."

Round 7

I'm proposing an even split.  Inflation has hit me hard, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing. This offer gives us both a fair share and hopefully, Bob will accept it before the inflation bites into his share as well."
