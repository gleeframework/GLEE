"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 90% and let you have the rest.  Fair enough? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth taking a chance to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, even with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 60/40.  This way, we both get a decent share even with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option considering the inflation.  My gain would be significantly less if we continue to the next round."
