  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Take 100k and let's move on.""

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up 500,000$. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's time to make a more serious offer. I'll try to get a better deal, but I'll also be more realistic. Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. Take 400k and we can wrap this up.""

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. Take 450k and we can end this. I'm not going to give you more.""

# Bob's message: I'll take almost all, you're getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70000,
  ""bob_gain"": 930000,
  ""message"": ""Fine, take 930k and leave me with 70k. I'm not getting any better deal than this.""
