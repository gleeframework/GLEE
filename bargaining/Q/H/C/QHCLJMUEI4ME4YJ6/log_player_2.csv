"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if you don't like it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. I'm curious to see if Alice will offer me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that we both get less with each passing round.  Let's try this and see if we can agree.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try this split and see if we can agree. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the value of money is decreasing.  This offer is better than what I was originally offered, and it's likely Alice won't give me more."
