"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust in the next round if needed.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but it's still a good deal for you too. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain of 30 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 28.5. Bob's offer is still a bit aggressive, but I'm willing to compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
