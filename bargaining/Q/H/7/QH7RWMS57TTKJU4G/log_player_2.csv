"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation strongly benefits me in later rounds. I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but consider the declining value. This offer gives you a good deal while acknowledging the time pressure.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to feel the time pressure, but this offer is still unacceptable. While it's closer to a compromise, the inflation will continue to hurt her more than me. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6300,
""alice_gain"": 3700,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value is shrinking faster for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting frustrating. While Alice is finally acknowledging the need to compromise, this offer is still tilted in her favor, especially considering the rapidly depreciating value.  I need to show I'm serious about waiting for a better deal, even if it means risking everything."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The pot is shrinking rapidly. Accept this generous offer before we both lose out!""
}
