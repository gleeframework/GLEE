I'm not convinced. I believe I can still secure a better deal.  Let's see if I can push for a higher share."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's time to make a deal 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I could potentially get a slightly better deal, it's not worth risking everything with so many rounds left.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it ensures I get something rather than nothing."
