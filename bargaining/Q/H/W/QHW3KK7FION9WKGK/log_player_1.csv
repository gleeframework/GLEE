"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is a fairer reflection of my superior negotiating skills. ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed by Bob's attempt to negotiate a 60/40 split in his favor, especially considering his condescending message. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more balanced split""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still maintaining a decent margin for myself. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed by Bob's attempt to lowball me with this offer. The 3000/7000 split is unacceptable, and I'm not convinced that Bob has a better deal elsewhere. I think I can do better than this, and I'll reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's time to make a deal""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to accept it."
