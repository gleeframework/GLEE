"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80 dollars and leave 20 dollars for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively gaining 72 dollars (80 * 0.9).

As for Bob's offer, he's suggesting a 50-50 split, which is a significant concession from his initial offer. However, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars, leaving 30 dollars for Bob. This is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, Alice, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

With the new inflation rates, my gain is worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively gaining 73.1 * 80 = 58.48 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer, he's still trying to get a better deal, but I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates, my gain is worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively gaining 58.48 dollars. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Getting close to the middle, but I'm still not giving up""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars, leaving 40 dollars for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, considering the inflation and my previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

With the new inflation rates, my gain is worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively gaining 59.05 * 80 = 47.24 dollars.

Considering Bob's final offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'm getting a bit desperate, but I don't want to give up too much. I'll think carefully...

Hmmm... I think I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than walking away with almost nothing.
