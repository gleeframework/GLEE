"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split. I figure I can get most of the money, knowing that inflation will hurt Bob more than me in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best strategy. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My share of the money is now worth 20% less.  A rejection would mean another round, and another 20% reduction in my share.
* **Even Split:**  Bob's offer is an even split, meaning I'm getting half the remaining money. 
* **Risk:** There's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to make a better offer in the future rounds. 

It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 now than risk losing more due to inflation and potential worse offers from Bob."
