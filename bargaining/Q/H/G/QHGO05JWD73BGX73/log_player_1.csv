"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but still want to be fair 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $30 is now worth $28.2.

I'm not thrilled about the large disparity in our gains, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
