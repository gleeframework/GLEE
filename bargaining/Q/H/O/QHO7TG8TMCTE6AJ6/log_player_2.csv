Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is a factor, but a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward.  This way, we both get a fair share of the remaining value. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
