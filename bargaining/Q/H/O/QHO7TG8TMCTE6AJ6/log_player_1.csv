Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation rate will favor you more in the next rounds. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
