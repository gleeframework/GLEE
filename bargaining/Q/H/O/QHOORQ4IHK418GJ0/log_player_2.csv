# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in her demands, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for her. It's likely she's feeling the pressure and might be willing to accept an even smaller share in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and stop wasting time.  Every round costs us both money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a 50/50 split.  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth for both of us, especially Alice.  Offering an even split seems fair and emphasizes the need to settle quickly."
