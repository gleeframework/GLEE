**Reasoning:**

Bob is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation on his own gains. While a 60/40 split might sound ""fair"" in principle, the rapid devaluation of his share makes it a bad deal for him in reality.  I need to make him understand the urgency of accepting a reasonable offer sooner rather than later."
