I'm going for a greedy strategy here. I'll take almost everything, knowing that Bob has to accept in the first round to get anything at all.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer. Even with the 20% inflation, 200,000 is better than nothing, and I don't know what Bob will offer in the next round. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal later."
