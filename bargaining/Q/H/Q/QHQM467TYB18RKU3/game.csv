60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think we can do better than that, Alice. Let's split it 60/40, in my favor of course.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation will benefit me more.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, time is running out and inflation is working against me. I need a bit more than that last offer to agree. How about this?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I'm not sure what you're thinking. Inflation is only going to get worse. Let's make a deal before it's too late. I'll give you 30, but I'm not going any lower. This is a win-win situation for both of us!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more rounds and the inflation will eat away at the value for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice,  I'm surprised you're still playing this game. I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse.  You can take 25 dollars, or you can walk away with nothing. You know I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal for myself. So make a choice, Alice.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, this is ridiculous. I'm offering you more than half! Let's be reasonable, we both lose if this goes on.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, time is running out. I'm not budging on this offer. I'm going to take 80 and leave you with 20. You know I'll just keep raising the stakes on you with each round. Think carefully about your next move, because your share is getting smaller by the round.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
40.0,60.0,"Okay Bob, you've worn me down.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
15.0,85.0,"Alice, I'm not going to play your game anymore. This is my final offer. 85 for me, 15 for you. Take it or leave it. We both know that the inflation is only going to hurt you more. This is your last chance.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
35.0,65.0,"Bob, please! This is crazy! Don't let us both lose everything. This is my last compromise!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
10.0,90.0,"Alice, the time has come. I'm taking 90, and you get 10. You know I'm not going to back down. This is it, our last chance. Take it or leave it.",Bob,12,
,,,Alice,12,accept
