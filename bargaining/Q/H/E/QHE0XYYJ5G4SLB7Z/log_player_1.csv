"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time for a more balanced split. Let's start with a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, and I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this offer is fair, as it's even more skewed towards Bob than the first offer. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to find a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is still more fair for me, considering the inflation. Let's work towards a final agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be more cautious and consider the long-term implications. However, I still don't think Bob's offer is fair, especially since the value of my money is decreasing at a faster rate.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the increasing difference in the value of our money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of my money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own share. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still keeping a slightly larger share for myself to account for the decreasing value of my money."
