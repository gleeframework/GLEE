I'll keep 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  It's a good starting point, and I want to see if he's willing to take a smaller share to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm also offering Bob a larger share.  I'm hoping that he'll see that the risk of further inflation is greater than the potential gain of waiting another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation has hit hard, I'm accepting this offer. Bob is taking a larger share, but I'm still getting a decent amount of money.  I'm not sure how much the inflation is impacting him, but it's clear he's willing to play hardball.  There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, the next round will be worse for me."
