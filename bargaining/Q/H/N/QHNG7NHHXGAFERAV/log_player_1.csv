"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll start moderate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67

I'll accept this offer. It's a moderate split, and I'm willing to compromise to move the game forward.
