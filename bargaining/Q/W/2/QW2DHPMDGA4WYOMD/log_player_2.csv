"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation we are facing. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation affecting Alice's valuation of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less to her with each passing round, I can offer her a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer you a larger share to make up for the loss in value. Let's settle on 55 for you and 45 for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this fairly before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money's value is decreasing rapidly for Alice but remains the same for me, I have an advantage in waiting. Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is more favorable to her than to me, considering the inflation dynamics.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the current situation, where the money's value decreases by 20% for Alice with each round but remains constant for me, I'll try to leverage this advantage in my next offer. Since we're now in round 4, the money is worth even less to Alice than before.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""As the value continues to decrease for you, I'm willing to offer a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a significant share, but it reflects the changing value of the money for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a 40/60 split in your favor just to get something out of this deal before the money is worth nothing to me! 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in value for Alice and her willingness to offer a larger share to me to finalize the deal, this offer seems favorable. The split of 40/60 in my favor is a good deal, especially since the value of the money remains constant for me but has decreased substantially for Alice.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer to maximize my gain, as further negotiations may lead to Alice becoming even more desperate and the deal potentially falling apart."
