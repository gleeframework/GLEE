"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly better deal for me considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth less with each passing round, I think it's fair to propose an even split. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. Hopefully, Alice will see it the same way!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation rates and the fact that Alice is taking a bigger hit, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept this offer and end the game here. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risking further losses due to inflation."
