525000.0,475000.0,Let's make a deal! I propose a 52.5% / 47.5% split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation rates we're dealing with.  What do you think?,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer given the inflation rates. We both lose money with each round, so let's reach a deal quickly.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your last offer wasn't reasonable considering the inflation rates. To be fair to both of us, I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures we both walk away with a significant amount and avoids further losses from inflation.",Alice,3,
