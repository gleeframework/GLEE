6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a reasonable starting point to ensure we both benefit from this deal before inflation eats into the value.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that still allows us both to get a good share of the money before inflation takes effect.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split, but in my favor this time. It's a fair counter-offer considering the decreasing value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable.  The money is losing value fast. I propose a 50/50 split to ensure we both maximize our gains. It's the fairest way to move forward.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
