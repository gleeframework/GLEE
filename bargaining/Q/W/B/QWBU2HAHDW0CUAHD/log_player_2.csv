"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a reasonable starting point to ensure we both benefit from this deal before inflation eats into the value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While 4000$ is a decent starting point, I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that still allows us both to get a good share of the money before inflation takes effect.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split, but in my favor this time. It's a fair counter-offer considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While 4500$ is still a decent amount, I'd prefer to negotiate a split that's more even, as we both stand to lose a lot of money with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  The money is losing value fast. I propose a 50/50 split to ensure we both maximize our gains. It's the fairest way to move forward.""}
