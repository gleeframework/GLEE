"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about your initial offer, but I'll try to be more generous this time 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the decreased value of my share due to inflation."

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bit more.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to Bob."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my share! Given the decreased value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my decision-making. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's not favorable to me, especially considering the reduced value of my share due to inflation. I'll wait for a better opportunity."

  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more now.""

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Given the significantly reduced value of my share, I'll have to consider Bob's final offer carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a significant reduction from his previous offers, the value of my share is still too low due to inflation. I'll wait for another opportunity to negotiate a better deal."

```
{

  ""message"": ""I'm taking a huge risk, Bob. I think I deserve a better share now.""
}
```

I'm making an extremely bold move, taking a massive share of the remaining money, hoping that Bob will accept it. I'm essentially betting that the value of my share is worth more to me than the tiny amount I'd get if I accept one of Bob's previous offers."

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, I'd rather take the tiny amount of $1000 than walk away with nothing. It's a sad end to the negotiation, but I'm not willing to risk getting nothing."
