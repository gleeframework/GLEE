"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but it is still fair to Bob and allows for a possible agreement in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 
This is a fair offer, splitting the money evenly. With the inflation, the money is worth less than in the first round and I want to avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it is tempting to accept an offer that would have been favorable in the first round, the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation. It is better to risk another round and potentially secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a slight increase in my share compared to the previous round. This reflects the diminishing value of the money due to inflation, but it's still a fair offer that could lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is significantly worse than any offer I've received before. It's not worth accepting, even with the inflation, as I'm likely to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split in my favor. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, so I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the loss. This is the best possible offer I can make while still considering fairness and Bob's potential willingness to accept."
