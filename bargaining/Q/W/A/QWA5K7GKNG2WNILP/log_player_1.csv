"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering you took the bigger share last round. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

Since the money is worth 10% less this round, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth 360,000 in real terms.

I'll reject Bob's offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a different split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
