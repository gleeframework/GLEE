Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Since we don't know how inflation affects him, it's best to be cautious and try to secure a large share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. Taking a 50/50 split now is better than risking another round and potentially getting less due to inflation."
