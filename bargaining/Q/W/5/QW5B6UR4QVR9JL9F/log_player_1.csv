"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio, favoring your larger share earlier in the game to account for potential inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the potential for inflation.  This allows us both to get a decent share while accounting for the possibility that the money will be worth less in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
