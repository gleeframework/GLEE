"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money worth 10% less, I'd be getting only 2,000 dollars, which is a significant decrease from the 6,000 I was initially aiming for.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more""
}
```

I'm now offering to take 30% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 70%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it or walk away! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! With the money worth 27.1% less than the original, I'd be getting only 1,000 dollars, which is a significant decrease from my previous offers.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. While it's still a relatively low amount, it's getting to the point where I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it and try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
