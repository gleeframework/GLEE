Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I think a 60/40 split is more fair this time.  The value of the money decreases for both of us as we wait. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
