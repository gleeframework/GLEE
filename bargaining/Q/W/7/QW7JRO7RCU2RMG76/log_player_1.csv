"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, which is $200,000, and keeping the remaining 80% for myself, which is $800,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit less, but I'll give you a chance to reconsider 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less for me, so the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000
* Bob's gain: $200,000 * 0.95 = $190,000

Considering Bob's new offer, I see that he's taking a bit less, but still keeping a significant majority of the money. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $640,000 * 0.8 = $512,000
* Bob's gain: $190,000 * 0.95 = $180,500

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but I still need to make a good deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping a majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more aggressive, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 48.8% less for me, so the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $800,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $416,000
* Bob's gain: $200,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $172,080

Considering Bob's new offer, I see that he's being more aggressive, but still offering me a significant share of the money. However, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 48.8% less than in Round 4, so the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $416,000 * 0.8 = $331,200
* Bob's gain: $172,080 * 0.95 = $163,276

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to get a significant portion of the money for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 6, the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $800,000 * (1 - 0.6723) = $264,160
* Bob's gain: $200,000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $148,400

Considering Bob's new offer, I see that he's being more aggressive and trying to get a larger share, but I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'm still getting a relatively small share due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
