"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, and 5% less for Alice, the total value of the money is now 90% of 10,000$ for me, and 95% of 10,000$ for Alice.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 19% less for me, and 9.75% less for Alice, compared to the first round.

My calculation:
Original 10,000$ for me in the first round is now worth 81% of the original amount, which is 8100$.
Original 10,000$ for Alice in the first round is now worth 90.25% of the original amount, which is 9025$.

My offer is actually more generous than Alice's offer, so I'll reject it.
