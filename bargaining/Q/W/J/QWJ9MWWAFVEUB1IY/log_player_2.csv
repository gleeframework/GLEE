Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I took into account the inflation, my offer is better than the last one, for both of us 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'll accept this offer. Even though the inflation is hurting me, I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
