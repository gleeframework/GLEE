Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share since you're the one who made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
