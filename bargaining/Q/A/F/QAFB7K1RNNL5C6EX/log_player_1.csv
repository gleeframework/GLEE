"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give Bob 100,000$.  This way I get the majority share, but it's still a fair offer to start with.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to 600,000 for myself, but still giving Bob a significant share at 400,000.  With inflation, things are getting more serious, and I need to make sure I get a decent amount to keep up with the diminishing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse, and I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject this and see what happens in the next round.  The inflation is biting, but I'm going to hold out for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  With the inflation hitting us both hard, I think it's the fairest option at this point. Let's see if Bob is willing to be reasonable."
