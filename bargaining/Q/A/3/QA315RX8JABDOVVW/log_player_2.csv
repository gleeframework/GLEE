Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation impacts you, but I also need a reasonable share.  My 60/40 was fair. This 55/45 split still gives you a slight edge considering the devaluation over the next few rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
