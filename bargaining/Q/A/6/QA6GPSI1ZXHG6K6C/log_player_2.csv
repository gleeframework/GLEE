Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,

""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable. Your turn!""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's split it 50/50 to end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
