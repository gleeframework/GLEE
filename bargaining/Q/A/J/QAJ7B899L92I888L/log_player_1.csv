I'm starting with a very greedy offer, knowing that Bob has no leverage in this first round. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. While it seems tempting to take even a small amount,  I know the inflation will make that amount even smaller in the next round.  I'd rather gamble and try to get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, hoping to incentivize him to accept. The inflation has impacted my potential gains, so I need to make a more reasonable offer to avoid losing out completely.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
