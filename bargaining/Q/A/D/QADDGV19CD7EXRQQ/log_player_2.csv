"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims to divide the funds with a significant difference in favor of Alice, considering the potential inflation effects.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, acknowledging your potential inflation advantage but also wanting to ensure a fair outcome for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've decided to propose a more equitable distribution, aiming for a balance that reflects our respective positions without significantly compromising my interests. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, it's important to consider the inflation.  By rejecting, the next offer will be worth even less. Accepting ensures a decent gain, even if it's not the most favorable split."
