"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think this is a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a generous offer, considering the value of the money will decrease by 10% with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing by 10% each round, my gain of $9,000 in the first round is now worth $8,100 in the second round. 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept $5,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial proposal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
