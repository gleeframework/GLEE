I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, given Bob's money is losing value at twice the rate mine is.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low! I'm not giving up 70% of the money, especially since his money is losing value at twice the rate mine is. Let's see what I can do in round 3."

Round 3

I'm sticking with a 80/20 split in my favor, but adjusting it slightly to account for the inflation.  I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to accept."

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm reducing my share a little more, but I'm still holding out for a good chunk of the money.  The inflation is really hurting Bob now, so I'm hoping he'll realize he needs to accept this offer before it's too late."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This is a significant compromise on my part, but the inflation is starting to take a serious toll. I'm hoping Bob will realize that a 55/45 split is better than risking getting nothing at all.  We are getting very close to the deadline, so I need to make a move."
