"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small share to start""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, and keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still a good chunk for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 6000$ is actually worth 4800$ in real value. And Bob's gain of 4000$ is worth 3200$ in real value.

I'm not too thrilled about the division, but I'll consider it. I'd rather get a bit more, but I'll accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split.
