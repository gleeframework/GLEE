"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is 25% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation effect.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $320,000.

I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, as it's not favorable to me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the original amount. I'm hoping this is more acceptable to him!"
