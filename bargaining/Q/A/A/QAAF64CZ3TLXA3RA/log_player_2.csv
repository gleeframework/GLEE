"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make sure I get a fair share. This offer is a better starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that this offer is a better starting point, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The rate of inflation is hurting her much faster than me. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
