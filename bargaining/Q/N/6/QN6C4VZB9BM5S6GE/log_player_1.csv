"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still leaving you with a decent share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less than before, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with the significant imbalance in the split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains! With the value of my potential gain decreasing rapidly, I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is giving up enough. With the inflation rate, I think I can do better than this. I'd like to try to negotiate a higher share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping enough for myself to account for the decreasing value of money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gains. With the value of my potential gain decreasing rapidly, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is giving up enough. With the inflation rate, I think I can do better than this. I'd like to try to negotiate a higher share for myself, but I'll need to be careful not to leave Bob with too much."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to a 50-50 split, but I think I deserve it given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to revert to the original even split, but with the value of money decreasing, I'm hoping Bob will see that a 50-50 split is a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
