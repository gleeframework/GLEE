"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept.  I want to secure as much as possible in the early rounds before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer considering inflation. Accepting it ensures I get a decent amount of money, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
