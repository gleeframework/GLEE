"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 5000 is now equivalent to 4500 in the first round's value. It's a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my chance to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer for now.
