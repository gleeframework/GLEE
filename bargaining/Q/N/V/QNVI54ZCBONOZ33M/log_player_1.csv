"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  It's a fairly aggressive offer, but I figure I can probably get away with it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer. It's the same as my offer in the first round, except the money is now worth 10% less. I'm going to try to do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

I'm lowering my demand slightly, but still keeping a majority share.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, he's likely to be more willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm lowering my demand again, hoping that Bob will see the value in getting something rather than nothing. Inflation is hurting me, so I need to strike a deal soon."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm taking a bigger risk here, offering Bob a larger share. I'm hoping that the increasing pressure from inflation will finally convince him to accept."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm cutting my losses and offering Bob a larger share. Time is running out, and with each passing round, the value of the money is plummeting. It's a risky move, but I need to secure some deal before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I have to accept this offer. While it's much less than what I initially hoped for, it's still something. With only a few rounds left, the value of the money is getting dangerously low.  I'm taking what I can get to avoid getting nothing at all."
