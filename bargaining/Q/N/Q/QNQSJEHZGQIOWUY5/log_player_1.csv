"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a 90/10 split in favor of myself. This is a relatively generous offer in the first round, as the inflation effect is still small. I'm aiming to secure a large share of the money while still being fair enough to potentially avoid rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the 250,000 offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:** My share is worth 5% less than the initial offer, but Bob's share is worth 20% less. This means the value gap has widened significantly in my favor.
* **Potential for Higher Gain:** I have a strong bargaining position here. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, suggesting he's desperate for a deal.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  I can counter with a more favorable offer in the next round, and there's a chance Bob might accept it to avoid further inflation.

I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

In round 3, I am proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:**  My gains are worth 5% less than round 2, but Bob's gains are worth another 20% less due to continuing inflation. This means the value gap is even wider now. 
* **Negotiation Power:** Bob rejected my previous offer and then offered a very lopsided deal in round 2. This suggests he's feeling pressured, and I'm using that to my advantage.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  A 60/40 split still leaves a significant portion for Bob, which might make him more inclined to accept.  However, it's also a significantly better deal for me than Bob's offer.

I believe this offer is a good balance between securing a good share for myself and increasing the likelihood of a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:** My gains are now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, while Bob's gains are worth a whopping 48.8% less. This means the bargaining power has shifted significantly in my favor.
* **Risk of Further Losses:** If I reject this offer, there's a high chance that the next round will result in even lower gains for me due to continued inflation. 
* **Fair Deal Considering Inflation:** Although it's a less favorable split than my initial offer, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. A 400,000 gain is still substantial, and it's better than risking further losses.

While I would ideally like to secure a larger share, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical decision in this scenario. The risk of further losses outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal in the next round."
