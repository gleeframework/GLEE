"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a majority of the money, but it also leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a better deal for himself in the next round.  It's a balance between securing a decent amount and avoiding an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would have preferred to get more money, I see the value of my share decreasing with each round. Accepting this offer ensures that I get something, even though it's less than my initial proposal. The risk of rejecting and entering a new round with further decreasing value is too great for me."
