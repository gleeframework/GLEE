"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and close the deal! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. This is your last chance for a good deal.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  Alice's offer was slightly in her favor. By rejecting, we signal that we're willing to play the game and that a 50/50 split isn't good enough for us.
* **Inflation Advantage:** The value of the money decreases faster for Alice.  Delaying benefits us more than her.
* **Strong Offer:** Offering Alice $4000 (which will be worth considerably less next round) puts significant pressure on her to accept. The message aims to make her think this is her last chance for a reasonable payout."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in earlier rounds, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is increasingly risky. The potential gain from a slightly better split might not outweigh the loss from further inflation. 
* **Alice's Desperation:** Alice's offer suggests she's feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely. Accepting now capitalizes on her willingness to compromise."
