"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but not too much. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer. However, 70 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
