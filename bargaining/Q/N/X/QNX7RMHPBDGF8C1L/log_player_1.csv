I propose to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  Let's get this started quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to take a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still aiming for the majority. Bob needs to compromise if he wants to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 600000

Bob is still offering a very uneven split, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a more equitable proposal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a more even split this time. It's clear Bob wants a larger share, but we need to be reasonable to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too close to the last round. I'm holding out for a larger share, as we both are losing money rapidly due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a compromise.  We both need to be more flexible or we'll end up with nothing.  This split is fair considering the inflation we're both facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

With inflation accelerating, getting anything at this point is better than nothing.  Let's split it evenly."
