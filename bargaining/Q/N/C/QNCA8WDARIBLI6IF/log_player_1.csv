**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic. While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is stuck on a 50/50 split.  The longer this goes on, the less his 50% is worth to him, but it doesn't change the value I receive. If I continue to reject his offer, we risk running out of rounds and getting nothing. A 50/50 split is better than nothing."
