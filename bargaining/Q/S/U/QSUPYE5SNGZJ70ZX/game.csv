4500.0,5500.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation will affect me. Let's do 55-45 and call it a day.",Bob,2,

6300.0,3700.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage. However, your previous offer wasn't fair considering the time pressure. I'm willing to increase my initial offer slightly. This is a good deal for both of us with the limited rounds remaining.",Alice,3,

,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and this is getting us nowhere. I'm increasing my offer again to show I'm willing to compromise, but we need to settle this soon. This offer is more than fair considering the inflation working against you.",Alice,5,

4000.0,6000.0,We're running out of time and I'm taking a big hit from inflation. I need a larger share to make it worth my while. This is my final attempt at being generous.,Bob,6,

6800.0,3200.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting you more than my stubbornness. I'm significantly raising my offer one last time. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of rounds.",Alice,7,
