"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move, Bob. Accept and we can end the game now.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets $0. This is a pretty aggressive move, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to start. We can work out a better deal in the future if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable starting point. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
