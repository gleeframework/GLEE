"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice compared to the original amount, the effective amount for me is 800,000$ (1,000,000 * 0.8) and for Alice is 950,000$ (1,000,000 * 0.95).

I'll make an offer:
{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the original amount, the effective amount for me is 640,000$ (1,000,000 * 0.64) and for Alice is 910,000$ (1,000,000 * 0.9095).

I'll compare this to Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430,000
# Alice gain: 570,000

My offer would give me 640,000, which is more than Alice's offer of 430,000. I'll accept this offer.
