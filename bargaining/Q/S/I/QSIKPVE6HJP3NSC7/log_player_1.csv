I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, giving Bob only $1000.  I figure in the early rounds, he's likely to be more willing to accept a smaller offer, hoping to get something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much fairer, but I'm going to reject it. I know that I can do better than $1000 since the money is still worth a decent amount. Plus, I want to see if I can push for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try to be a bit more reasonable this time, but still aiming for a larger share. Since I know inflation is affecting the value of the money, I'm going to offer Bob a bit more than last round, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the pie."
