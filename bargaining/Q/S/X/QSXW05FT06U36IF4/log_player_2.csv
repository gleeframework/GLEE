"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I think 70/30 is a fair split to start. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be fair, I'm proposing a 60/40 split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise. How about 65/35?  Remember, the value is decreasing for you with each round. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
It's getting close to the wire. Accepting a slightly lower offer now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
