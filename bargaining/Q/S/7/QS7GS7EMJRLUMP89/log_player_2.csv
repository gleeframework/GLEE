"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a little more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's only fair!""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less in each round, I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in accepting this offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount. Fingers crossed!"
