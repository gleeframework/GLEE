"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll take that into account. My offer is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. 

In this round, I would gain $6,000, which is 80% of $7,500 (the amount I would have gained in the first round if Bob had accepted my offer). This is not as good as my original offer, so I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 20% inflation again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself."
