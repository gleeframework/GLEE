"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share this round.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $10, which is a small share, and I'll take the rest, $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a slightly more even split this time, considering the inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less this round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""You offered me 45, I'm offering you 64 this time, let's see if you'll take it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, hoping he'll accept it."
