"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that tries to persuade Bob that this is a fair deal. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm trying to take advantage of that by offering a slightly uneven split. However, I'm still being somewhat generous to Bob, as a 60-40 split is not extremely one-sided. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and get him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a more fair split, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the 55-45 split is actually more in my favor than it initially seems. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob, his 55 is actually equivalent to 44 in the first round, while my 45 remains the same. I believe I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Bob. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, which, considering the inflation, is actually more like a 55-36 split in terms of the value of the money in the first round. This way, I'm trying to get a better deal while still appearing to offer a relatively fair split.\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55-45 is a fair compromise!""}"
