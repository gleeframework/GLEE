I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more than 5000, accepting this offer guarantees me at least something. With each round, the money is worth less, and I don't know how Bob is affected by inflation. It's better to secure half than risk getting nothing in the end."
