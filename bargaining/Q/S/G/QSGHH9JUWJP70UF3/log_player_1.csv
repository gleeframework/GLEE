"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be equal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
