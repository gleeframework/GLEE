"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the bigger share but still leaving him something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm losing less money in this round, Bob is getting a much larger share than he did in the first round. I'm not willing to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob since he's losing more value with each round. I'm willing to take a larger loss myself to avoid another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a significantly lower amount than I'd prefer, I'm losing a lot of value with each round. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing if we keep going."
