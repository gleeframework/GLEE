"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $38.

I'm not sure I like Bob's offer, as it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.
