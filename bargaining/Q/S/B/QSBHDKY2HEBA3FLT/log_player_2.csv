"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money loses value each round, I need to be strategic!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
``` 
I'm going to offer Alice $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself.  Since the money is losing value, I want to get as much as possible in the early rounds. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm going to accept this offer.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  At least this way I get something, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
