"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob a 30% share, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'm looking for a better deal. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, but I'm not confident that Bob will accept it, so I'm preparing for a counteroffer."
