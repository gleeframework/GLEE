"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think I can do better. Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $600,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually $570,000. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is not very different from my original offer. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you the majority of the money. Can you offer something more competitive?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 95% of its value in Round 2, so it's now worth 95% of 95% of its original value, which is 90.25% of its original value. So, my offer in Round 3 is worth 90.25% of the original $600,000, which is $540,150.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540150,
  ""bob_gain"": 459850,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly larger share. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve a larger cut. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, my $540,150 is worth 85.74% of its value in Round 3, which is 85.74% of 90.25% of its original value, which is 77.45% of its original value. So, my offer in Round 4 is worth 77.45% of the original $600,000, which is $464,700.

Bob's offer is a 35-65 split, which is a significant concession from his previous offer. I'll consider it.

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair compromise. I'll accept your offer and we can end the game.""
