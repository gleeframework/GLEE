600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'm willing to take a bit more since I made the first offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,Let's flip the script - I'll take 60% and you get 40%. It's only fair since you took the bigger share in the last round!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,I'll compromise and reduce my share. 58-42 is a more reasonable split.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"I'm increasing my share again. With inflation hitting us both, it's time to be realistic. I'm offering 65% and you get 35%. Let's settle this before we lose more money!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"I'll reduce my share again, but I won't go as low as 35%. 56-44 is a fair compromise, considering the inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Inflation is hurting both of us, but you're losing a lot more than I am.  I'm willing to accept 70% and leave you with 30%.  Let's make a deal!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
530000.0,470000.0,"I'll keep reducing my share, but I won't go below 53%. Inflation is hurting me more, but I still want a decent cut.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"I'm raising my share to 75%. Inflation is taking a toll on both of us, but you are losing much more than me.  Let's avoid losing even more money by agreeing to this.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
500000.0,500000.0,We're both losing a lot to inflation. I'll meet you in the middle - 50-50. Let's end this before we lose everything.,Alice,9,
