Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make my own proposal."

# Bob gain: 600000

Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 66.7% of the original $900,000, which is $600,000.
