"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, as I want to see how Bob reacts.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself later, but I want to test his willingness to play the game and see how much he values fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to have more money, I'm not willing to risk getting nothing at all.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I'll accept it."
