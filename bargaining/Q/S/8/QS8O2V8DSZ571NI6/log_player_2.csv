"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you still get a good chunk. Accept, and we're both happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While 100,000 is a decent amount, I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a fair share.  Accept this, and we both get a good amount before the money starts losing value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from last round. This offer is fair and leaves us both with a significant amount. Accept, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While it's better than the last round,  I believe I can still do better.  It's worth holding out a few more rounds to see if I can get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the difference again, but I need to get a bigger share. This is a fair deal. Let's avoid further losses and accept this offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both. We need to find a way to divide the money evenly before it's worth nothing. This is the only way to ensure we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the best offer I've received yet.  While I would have liked more, Alice is right - inflation is hitting us both hard.  This deal ensures that we both get a good amount before the money is worth nothing. Let's end this game and take the money."
