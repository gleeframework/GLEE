"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 20% inflation rate for me is quite steep, but I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation rate. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest given the inflation.  Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, I think accepting the 50/50 split at this point is the best decision. The money I gain is already worth 36% less than in the first round, and further rounds will only decrease its value more drastically compared to Alice's loss. It's time to cut my losses and accept the offer.
