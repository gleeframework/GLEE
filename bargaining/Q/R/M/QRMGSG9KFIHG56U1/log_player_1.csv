"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fair and reasonable starting point, with me getting 60% of the total and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems very even-handed. But I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% * 90% = 81%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split this time, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 73.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 26.1% = 73.9%).

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept this offer.
