Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about it... and decide to reject this offer. The offer is still not in my favor, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
