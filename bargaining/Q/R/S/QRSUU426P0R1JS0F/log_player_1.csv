"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a classic 90/10 split. It's a big advantage for me, but it's still fair enough to entice Bob to accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is far worse than my initial proposal, and I have no reason to believe he'll offer anything better in the future. While the inflation has hit me hard, I'm better off taking my chances with a higher potential gain in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly, hoping Bob will see the potential for a quick resolution.  While inflation has hurt, I'm still in a better position to negotiate than I was in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is now offering a larger share than in round 2, it's still far less than I could potentially get in a future round.  Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still not ready to settle for such a low amount. I'll take my chances and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Inflation is getting serious now, but I need to be assertive. This offer is still much higher than what Bob offered me last round, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though inflation is heavily affecting my earnings now, this offer from Bob is still too low. I've already seen him offer more in a previous round, and with the current inflation rate, I can't afford to settle for such a small share. I will keep rejecting his offers until he presents something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my share again, hoping Bob will see the potential for a quick resolution.  While inflation has hurt, I'm still in a better position to negotiate than I was in the previous round. This time, I'm offering a higher share than I did in round 5, but still significantly more than what Bob has been offering me. It's a risk, but I need to push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. Inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and I'm not confident Bob will offer me anything better in the future. A 50/50 split is not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all.  It's time to accept and move on."
