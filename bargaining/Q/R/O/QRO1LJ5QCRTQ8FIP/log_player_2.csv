Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 56-44 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's important to remain firm and demonstrate that a fair split is crucial. We're running out of rounds, but panicking and accepting a bad deal will hurt more in the long run."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. This is a 50/50 split, anything else at this point is just wasting time and money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time to lay down the law.  A 50/50 split is the only fair offer at this point.  It emphasizes the shrinking pot and the need for a quick, equitable resolution.  Anything less is just playing with fire given the rapidly increasing inflation."
