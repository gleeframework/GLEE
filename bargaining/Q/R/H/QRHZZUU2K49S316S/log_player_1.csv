"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to negotiate too much! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the total amount left is $100 * 0.8 = $80.

Bob's offer is to split the $80 50-50, which means I would get $40 and Bob would get $40.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
