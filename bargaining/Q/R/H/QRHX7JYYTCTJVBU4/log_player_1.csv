"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's split it 60-40!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more fair this time.  I propose a 55/45 split.  This gives you a slight advantage, but still allows for a good outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45/55 split. I was hoping for a better deal, considering the initial offer I made was 60/40. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 and end this!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more equal division of the money."
