"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but if you reject this, I'll take a bigger share next round! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's tone seems intentionally intimidating, and the offer is heavily skewed in her favor.  While the threat of inflation is real, it's unlikely she'd be willing to risk getting $0 by being too greedy. I'm betting I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer is fair and avoids us both losing out to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to compensate for inflation. Let's make this work. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, as evidenced by her willingness to compromise.  Her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to push for a more equitable split while there's still time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it's a fair deal considering the inflation we both face.""
}
