"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split. It's a bit unfair, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the potential for losing money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's frustrating to get such a small share, it's better than nothing. If I reject this offer, I risk getting even less in the next round due to inflation."
