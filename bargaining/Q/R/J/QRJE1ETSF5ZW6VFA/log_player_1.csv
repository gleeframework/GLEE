"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This ensures a fair distribution while also giving me a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}

I propose to take 810,000 dollars and give Bob 190,000 dollars. This offer ensures a fair division while minimizing the potential losses from further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

This is a risky move, but I believe it is still the best option to maximize my gains. The inflation is significant, and further rounds will only reduce the value of the money. This offer gives me a significant share of the money while still considering Bob's potential losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is not ideal, it's important to realize that inflation is severely affecting the value of the money.  Further rounds will only make the situation worse, with a greater loss in value. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something, whereas further rejection could lead to me getting nothing at all in the end."
