"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it almost equally, considering I made the first move 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I believe this split is more fair. Let's see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I should get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even with the inflation, getting $48 is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer."
