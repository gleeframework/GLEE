"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and taking 60 dollars for myself. I've included a message to try to persuade Bob that my offer is reasonable. Let's see how he responds!\n\n###  \n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision (accept or reject) and any message he might send back. I'll proceed accordingly.\n\n###  \n\nAlso, just to confirm, since this is Round 1, the money is still worth its full value for both of us, right? No inflation has kicked in yet?\n\n###  \n\nLooking forward to hearing back from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both be happier with this split. Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth less to both of us now, I think we should aim for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer, and I'll come up with a new proposal for Round 3.\n\n###  \n\nAlso, just to confirm, since we're now in Round 2, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, right? I want to keep track of the inflation correctly.\n\n###  \n\nLooking forward to making my next proposal!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm taking into account the inflation that's affecting both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Bob, I think a slightly more even split is in order. I'll offer Bob 45 dollars and take 55 dollars for myself. My message to Bob is an attempt to appeal to his sense of fairness, given the circumstances.\n\n###  \n\nLet me know how Bob responds to this offer. Will he accept, or will we move on to Round 4?\n\n###  \n\nAlso, just to confirm, since we're now in Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me (5% decrease from Round 1 to Round 2, and another 5% decrease from Round 2 to Round 3) and 40% less for Bob (20% decrease from Round 1 to Round 2, and another 20% decrease from Round 2 to Round 3), right? I want to make sure I'm keeping track of the inflation correctly.\n\n###  \n\nLooking forward to hearing back from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get this done. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not willing to accept this offer. Given the increasing inflation, I think Bob's offer is still not fair. The money is worth 14.26% less to me and 48.8% less to Bob, so I believe I should get a larger share. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer, and I'll come up with a new proposal for Round 5.\n\n###  \n\nAlso, just to confirm, since we're now in Round 4, the money is indeed worth 14.26% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, right? I want to ensure I'm accurately tracking the inflation.\n\n###  \n\nLooking forward to making my next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, but I think this split is more realistic now""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the current state of the money. Since the money is worth 14.26% less to me and 48.8% less to Bob, I believe a 58-42 split in my favor is more reasonable. My message to Bob aims to acknowledge the impact of inflation on both of us while justifying my proposed split.\n\n###  \n\nLet me know how Bob responds to this offer. Will he accept, or will we move on to Round 6?\n\n###  \n\nAlso, just to confirm, since we're now in Round 5, I'll need to calculate the new inflation rates for both of us. For me, it would be a 5% decrease from the previous round, making it a total of 19.26% less (14.26% from Round 4 + 5% decrease). For Bob, it would be a 20% decrease from the previous round, making it a total of 58.56% less (48.8% from Round 4 + 9.76% of the remaining value, which is 20% of 48.8). Correct me if I'm wrong, please.\n\n###  \n\nLooking forward to hearing back from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think it's time to accept Bob's offer. Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, a 50-50 split seems reasonable at this point. The money is worth 22.62% less to me and 67.23% less to Bob, so I believe this split is a fair compromise. I'll accept this offer and end the game here.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let Bob know that I've accepted his offer, and we can conclude the game.\n\n###  \n\nIt was a fun game! I'm glad we could play together. If you want to play again or try a different game, just let me know!"
