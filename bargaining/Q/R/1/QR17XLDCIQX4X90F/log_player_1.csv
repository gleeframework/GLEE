"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can finish the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% of the total, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think 20% is a fair share for me, considering I'm the one making the next proposal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 20% and I think I deserve more, I'll offer him 15% of the total. This way, I'll get a larger share, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% of the total, but I think it's still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is more generous than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less. I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than my previous one.
