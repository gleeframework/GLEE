"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, a fair and simple approach.""}

I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, but I'll have to make a decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not convinced that I should accept it. I think I deserve a better deal, especially since the money is worth less now.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to keep a slight edge. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation. I'll give you 3000, but I need more to make up for the loss. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the continued erosion of my purchasing power due to inflation. The 48.8% decrease in value is significant, and I'm struggling to make ends meet.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not convinced that I should accept it. The 3000 I would get is a significant decrease from the original 5000 I proposed, and I'm not sure I'm willing to accept such a drastic reduction.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the continued inflation and the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to prioritize my own financial stability in this inflationary environment. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a reasonable amount for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
