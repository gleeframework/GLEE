Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer myself a larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer in the first round, but I'm prepared for the negotiation to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's likely that Bob will continue to demand more in future rounds due to the inflation.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least $4000, and the potential for further rounds could lead to a loss for me."
