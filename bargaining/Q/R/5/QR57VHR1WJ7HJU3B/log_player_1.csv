"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself to account for the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
