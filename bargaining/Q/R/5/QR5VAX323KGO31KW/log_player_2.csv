"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the total amount is now $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8).

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is now worth 64% of its original value, so the total amount is $6,400 (10,000 * 0.64).

Alice's offer is 50/50, but since my gain is worth 36% less than the original amount, I'll consider the actual amount I'll gain.

Since 5000 is 78% of the original $6,400, I'll actually gain $5,040.

Considering this, I'll accept Alice's offer:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
