"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40 dollars and take 60. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me taking $60 and giving Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to give you a little more, but let's see if we can find a solution that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the new offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $45 is actually equivalent to $36 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I could have gotten $60 in the first round, which is equivalent to $48 in the new value. However, I'm willing to consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll give you 50 dollars and take 50. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with me taking $50 and giving Bob $50."
