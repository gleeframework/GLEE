"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the proposal carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer: 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
