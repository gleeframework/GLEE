"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is a decent amount, and I'll take $6000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, considering we both want to avoid the inflation penalty. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile splitting it evenly seems fair, I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'm willing to take a risk and try to get more in the next round. Plus, I don't want to give up too easily!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI'm trying to compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept it, considering we're both losing value due to inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
