"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm thinking I can do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 0.95% of the original amount, due to inflation.

I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle, especially since I know the money is worth less now. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach. I'll offer a slightly larger share to myself, while still being reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my initial proposal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'm willing to give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, the money is worth less and less. I need to be careful not to give away too much.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I was hoping for a larger share, but I don't want to risk waiting too long and getting even less. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can negotiate better in future rounds.
