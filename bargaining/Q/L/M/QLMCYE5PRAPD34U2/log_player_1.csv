Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than the last round. This offer is more fair, given the recent inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to a slightly advantageous position. By continuing to reject his offers, I signal that I'm willing to play hardball and time is running out. This might push him to propose a more genuinely fair deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split.  We are losing money with every round! ""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to go for a straight 50/50 split.  This emphasizes fairness and highlights the urgency of the situation due to the rapidly inflating money. This might be the final push Bob needs to accept a deal."
