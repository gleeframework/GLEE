Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share since the money is worth less to me than it is to you in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more for myself, the offer is fair considering the inflation factor and Bob's argument. Accepting ensures we both get something, and the game ends."
