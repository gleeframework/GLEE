"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share, or if he'll try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm losing value due to inflation, the amount I would gain is still significantly less than what I offered him. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, but still aiming for a larger share.  I'm hoping that Bob is starting to realize that continuing to reject offers will only result in a smaller payout for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Even though Bob is getting a larger share and his offer is affected by inflation, mine is still significantly affected.  I'm hoping he'll see that if he keeps rejecting offers, he'll be forced to accept something much less than he could have gotten in earlier rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  With each round, both of our potential earnings are decreasing due to inflation, so I'm hoping that Bob will start to see the need for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While my potential earnings are significantly reduced due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal.  It's clear that Bob is becoming increasingly desperate for a deal, but I'm willing to keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself, hoping to find a middle ground. While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation and the limited number of rounds remaining. I'm hoping Bob will finally see the need to accept a deal before it's too late for both of us."
