"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer.  I want to secure the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation.  It's better than risking getting even less in the next round.  Let's end this game!"
