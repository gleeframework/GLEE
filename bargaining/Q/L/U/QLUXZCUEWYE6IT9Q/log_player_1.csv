"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to do better in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% gain, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50, and try to do better next round!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find a more balanced solution. Maybe we can revisit the numbers and find a better deal in the next round."
