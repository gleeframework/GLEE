I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get 10 dollars!  Let's see what Alice offers next."

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Alice 10 dollars and keeping 90 for myself.  I'm hoping she'll realize that accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds!"
