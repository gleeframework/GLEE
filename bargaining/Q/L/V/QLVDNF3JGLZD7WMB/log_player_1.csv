"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $10,000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Bob. This allows us both to feel fairly compensated, considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the diminishing value of money and offers you a fair share while still providing me with a larger portion. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
