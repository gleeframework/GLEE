Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}

I'm offering a 52-48 split, hoping to take advantage of the inflation's impact on Bob's gain."
