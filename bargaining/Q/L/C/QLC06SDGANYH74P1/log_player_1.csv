"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm taking a large portion of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something to incentivize him to accept in the first round. I'm taking into account the potential for inflation in the later rounds, and I want to secure as much as possible for myself early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger portion of the money, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. With inflation, the value of my potential gains in the future will be significantly reduced.  5000$ now is better than risking a potentially smaller amount later."
