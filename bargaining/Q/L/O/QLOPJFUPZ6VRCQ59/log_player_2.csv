"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this, but remember, I'll be getting a bigger share in the next round if you reject this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take $100,000, it's better to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round.  The money is worth less for Bob with each passing round, so it's better to try to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split. Let's get this done before the money loses value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a larger share than you. This is my final offer before the money starts to lose value for me too. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. The money is losing value for me quickly, and Alice's offer is still significantly better than what I'd get if we reach the final rounds.  It's time to secure a reasonable share before we both lose out."
