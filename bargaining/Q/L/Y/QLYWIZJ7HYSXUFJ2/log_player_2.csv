"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take 60% and you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55 for me and 45 for you.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal than Alice's initial offer. By offering 55 for myself and 45 for Alice, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that Alice will accept before the value of the money decreases further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is going down, Bob. I'll take my previous offer back. You get what's left. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Since the money is worth 19% less for me now, and Alice's offer is slightly better than my previous counteroffer, I think it's a good idea to accept this deal before the value decreases even further. I'd rather have a guaranteed 45 now than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
