  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to be generous, but not too generous.
