Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. That first offer was ridiculous. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it or leave it, but remember, the pot gets smaller for you with every round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise. I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split in your favor. This is the best I can do, considering the shrinking value of the money. It's a better deal than rejecting and risking getting nothing in the next round.""}
