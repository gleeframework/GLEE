"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! This is a generous offer, and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. This offer is more fair, and we can both get a good amount of money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think it's fair that I get only $100,000, while Bob gets the lion's share of $900,000. I'd like to propose a new offer that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob gets 25%."
