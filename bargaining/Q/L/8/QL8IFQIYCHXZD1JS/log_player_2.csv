Alice's offer:

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal. While 400,000 is a good start, I know I can do better with the game mechanics.  Let's see what Alice's next offer is!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. But we'll both still get a good amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is fair, and I'm not sure I can do much better with the inflation in play.  Let's accept and move on."
