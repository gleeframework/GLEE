"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose we split the money 999,999 to me and 1 to Bob. This is a fair deal, as Bob gets something and I get most of the money. Since it's the first round, the value of the money is the same for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose we split the money 900,000 to me and 100,000 to Bob.  This is a fair deal, as Bob gets something and I get most of the money. Even though the money is worth less to Bob than in the previous round, this offer gives him a larger share than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a good deal for me. While the money is worth a lot less to Bob due to inflation, I'm getting an equal share.  I'd rather get half now than risk getting nothing in the future."
