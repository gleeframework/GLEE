I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept it, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty generous, but I'm going to reject it. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob a bit from the last round, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  I think he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, since the money is losing value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good offer from Bob, considering the inflation. Accepting it means I get to keep a significant amount of the money, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing if the game continues."
