Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a more balanced split. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution without giving you an unfair advantage.
