"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a quarter, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $250,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $237,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. I'd rather have $237,500 than risk going to the next round.
