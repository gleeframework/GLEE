"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $300,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which seems reasonable considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving away too much. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'm not thrilled with the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a better offer than the first one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
