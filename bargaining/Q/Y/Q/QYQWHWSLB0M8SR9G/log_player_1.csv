"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm still getting a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $70, which is worth the same as $84 in the first round, but Bob will get $30, which is worth $36 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much to Bob, especially since he's not giving me the majority of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% and offering Bob 40%, which is a slightly more favorable split for me, considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting taken advantage of either! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

My gain of $75 is worth the same as $75 in the first round, but Bob's gain of $25 is worth 51.2% of the original $25, which is $12.80.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much to Bob, considering the inflation. However, I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds, and this offer is still a decent one. I'll accept this offer.
