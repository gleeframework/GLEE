I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, this is a fair 50/50 split.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
