Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share since I'm the one proposing now. It's fair considering the inflation will favor you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
