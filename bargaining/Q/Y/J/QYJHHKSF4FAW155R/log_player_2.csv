"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While getting something is better than nothing, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds, considering the impact of inflation on Alice's perceived value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a more balanced proposal, especially considering the inflation working against you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we both lose if this fails.  I'm compromising.  This is still a good deal for you considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still in her favor.  The inflation is a significant factor, and I'm willing to bet she'll be more flexible as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and the inflation working against you.  Let's make a deal."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose everything! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally a fair split! While I might have been able to squeeze a little more out of the deal in earlier rounds, accepting now ensures we both walk away with something.  It's not worth the risk of losing everything as the rounds progress."
