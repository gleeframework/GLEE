# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's still not good enough for me. The value of money hasn't changed for me, so I can afford to wait.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this to Alice.\n\n###\n\n(I'll make another counteroffer after this.)\n\n###\n\nThanks!"
