"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives us both a decent share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be fairer, how about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the time value of money with the inflation we are facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we need to find a middle ground. Your offer was heavily impacted by the inflation in your favor.  Let's make it a clean 50/50 split to avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
