Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be fairer, how about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the time value of money with the inflation we are facing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
