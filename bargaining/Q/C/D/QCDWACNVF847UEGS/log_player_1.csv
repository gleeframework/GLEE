"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation that's reducing the value of the money.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
