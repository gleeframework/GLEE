"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $580,000 is worth 95% of the original $600,000, and Bob's gain of $420,000 is worth 84% of the original $500,000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 90% of its original value now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000, and I'll take the remaining $540,000. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this time!"
