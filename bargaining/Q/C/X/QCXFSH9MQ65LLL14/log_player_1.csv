"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate too much""}

I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it. If I accept, I'll get $4,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial offer.

However, if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, I'll have to make a new proposal, and the money will be worth even less due to inflation.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share of the money, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer, and that he'll be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority 
# Alice gain: 3700 
# Bob gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about it. If I accept, I'll get $3,700, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer.

However, if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, I'll have to make a new proposal, and the money will be worth even less due to inflation.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get squeezed out completely""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share of the money, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my previous offers, and that he'll be willing to accept it."
