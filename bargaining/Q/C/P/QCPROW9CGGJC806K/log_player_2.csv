I'm Bob, and I'm feeling greedy. Let's see if I can do better!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slightly bigger share this round.  It's still a fair deal, considering the inflation!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm adjusting my offer to account for inflation. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though Alice is getting more, I'm still getting a decent amount, and the money is worth the same as in the first round for me.  Let's call it a day!"
