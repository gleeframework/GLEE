"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slightly bigger share this round.  It's still a fair deal, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's a fair deal considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I think I should get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Bob's offer of $4,000 to me is too low. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm adjusting my offer to account for inflation. This way, we can both benefit from the deal.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a slightly more aggressive offer than before, taking into account the 10% loss in value due to inflation."
