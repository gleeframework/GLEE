# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of Bob's shrinking pot. While her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob needs to hold firm and show he's serious about getting a fair deal, even with the inflation pressure."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see that. I'll give you a tiny bit more, but don't expect me to go much lower 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly enjoying this and playing on Bob's fear of inflation.  While the offer is inching closer to fair, it's crucial for Bob to stand his ground. Accepting now would send the message that he'll cave under pressure, and Alice will likely exploit this in future rounds."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  We're running out of time, and I'm willing to lose a bit more to get this done.  Don't be greedy.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I'll give you one more chance to accept a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming marginally better, and Bob is feeling the heat of inflation.  He needs to secure something before the diminishing returns make even a 50/50 split unattractive. Accepting now is a better outcome than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
