"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.  Let's be fair and avoid letting this money depreciate any further. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
