Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous offer. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount. I think I can get a better deal if I wait. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn. Here's my proposal:\n\n# Bob's message: I think we should divide the money more equally.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate. I'm offering you 350,000, which is a slight increase from your previous offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement before the money loses more value.

# Alice gain: 650000
