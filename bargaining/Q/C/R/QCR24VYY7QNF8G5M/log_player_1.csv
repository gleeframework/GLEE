"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, as we both have to consider the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's proposal is a significant improvement from my initial offer, considering the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think I can do better. I'll try to make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll compromise on a 52-48 split. Let's try again!""}

I've adjusted my proposal to account for the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm offering a 52-48 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for Bob than my initial offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I still need a better deal than a 52-48 split. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 52-48 split, but I'm even less excited about Bob's new offer. Meeting in the middle at 45-55 is still not a great deal for me, considering the inflation. I think I can do better. I'll try to make another proposal that takes into account the continued inflation and my own negotiating power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try a 48-52 split. It's the best I can do for now.""}

I've adjusted my proposal to account for the continued inflation, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a deal done. I'm offering a 48-52 split, which is closer to Bob's desired 45-55 split, but still favors me slightly. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
