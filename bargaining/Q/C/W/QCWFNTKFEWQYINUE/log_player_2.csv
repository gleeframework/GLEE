"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a small taste of the pie. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unbalanced offer, and while it's tempting to take something, it's better to see if Alice will be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, and it gives us both a good starting point.""}
