I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a fair starting point, as it gives me a large share, but also allows for potential negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $8,000 for myself, increasing Bob's share to $2,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a larger portion.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous proposal, and the inflation is starting to impact his gains heavily. I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll continue to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to $7,000, offering Bob $3,000. While inflation is starting to affect Bob's potential earnings, I still believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that gives him a chance to gain something. It's important to keep the negotiations moving forward while still pursuing a favorable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer has increased, the inflation is making his offer less and less attractive. I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll continue to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, this time to $6,000, offering Bob $4,000.  The inflation is starting to seriously impact Bob's potential earnings, and I believe he needs to start considering accepting offers to avoid getting nothing. I'm hoping this offer will be tempting enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my previous proposal, and the inflation is severely impacting his gains. I'm not willing to settle for such a low share, especially since I believe I have a strong negotiating position. I will continue to push for a larger share and hope that Bob will realize the urgency of reaching an agreement before the inflation completely diminishes his potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Given the significant inflation, it's clear that both of us are losing value with every passing round.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to ensure we both receive something. This is a fair and equitable solution considering the current circumstances, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement before the inflation completely erodes our potential gains."
