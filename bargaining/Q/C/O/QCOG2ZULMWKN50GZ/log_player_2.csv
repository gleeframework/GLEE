"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. This offer will net you a cool $200,000. Time is of the essence, and it would be a shame to see the value of this money decrease with every passing round.

# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it wasn't in our best interest to accept at this time. This counter-offer still allows you a good chunk of the money, and we both need to be mindful of the value steadily decreasing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing significant value.  This offer gets us closer to a fair split while still giving you a sizable portion. We need to decide now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, Alice is clearly feeling the impact of inflation more than Bob.  She's getting desperate. Bob has held firm so far, and there's a good chance Alice will propose an even better offer next round to avoid getting closer to zero."
