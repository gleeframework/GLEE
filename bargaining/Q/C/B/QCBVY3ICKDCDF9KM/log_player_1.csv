"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I'll take $9000, leaving $1000 for Bob. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and it's better than getting nothing in 12 rounds.  I'll accept."
