I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount, or if he'll risk the inflation to get a bigger piece of the pie later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a substantial amount. I'm hoping that he'll recognize that the inflation is working against him, and that he'll be more likely to accept this offer than the previous ones."
