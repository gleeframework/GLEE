"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more considering the risk I'm taking. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (pre-inflation value)
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67 (pre-inflation value)

I don't think the offer is as generous as it seems, considering the risk I'm taking is the same as in the previous round. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a larger share of the money while it's still worth something. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair considering the risk I'm taking.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but not too greedy. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I'm being generous considering the inflation and the risk I'm taking. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the pre-inflation values:

Alice's gain: 5800 / 0.478 = 1211.39
Bob's gain: 4200 / 0.713 = 588.17

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer seems quite generous, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make up for the risk I'm taking. I'll accept the offer.
