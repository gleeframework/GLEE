"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and take 600k for myself.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money equally, each receiving $500,000. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to be cautious. Since Bob's offer is equal, I'll consider it a good option.

I accept the offer.
