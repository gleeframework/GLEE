"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400,000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since I'm getting less than 50% of the original amount, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I still think 50/50 is fair.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more now 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits. Since my gain is worth significantly less than before, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

However, Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, which means he's not affected by inflation as much as I am. This might give him an advantage in the negotiation.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping that Bob will make a more favorable proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping that the decrease in value of my gain due to inflation will make up for it."
