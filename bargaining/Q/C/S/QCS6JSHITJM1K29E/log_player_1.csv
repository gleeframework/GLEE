Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping to secure the majority of the money before inflation starts to seriously erode its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair offer and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round. Plus, inflation is starting to take effect, so accepting this offer is the best option for me."
