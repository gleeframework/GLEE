"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Although the money is worth less, the offer is still significantly better than the 600,000 I proposed in the previous round (which was rejected). 
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer means another round, where the money will be worth even less. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal. 
* **Potential Loss:**  Continuing to reject could result in losing a large portion of the potential gain due to inflation. 

While I might prefer a more even split, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic decision given the current circumstances."
