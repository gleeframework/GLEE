Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer a large portion to myself, but still give Bob a small amount. This way, I hope to incentivize him to accept the offer rather than risk losing even more in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
