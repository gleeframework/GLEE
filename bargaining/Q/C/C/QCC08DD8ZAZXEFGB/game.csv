7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the potential inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is a more reasonable proposal, considering the initial amount is still high and we have yet to account for inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Considering both our shares and the potential inflation, I propose an equal division of the $10,000. This ensures fairness and stability in value for both parties.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share to account for the risk of inflation affecting my portion. This 55/45 split seems fair.",Bob,4,
