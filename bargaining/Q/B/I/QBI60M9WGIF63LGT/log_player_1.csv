"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now than a smaller share later. However, I'm not convinced that I should give Bob the majority.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is trying to take the majority, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You wanted the majority, now it's my turn""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to take the majority, now I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I wanted to take the majority earlier. However, I'm not convinced that I should give him a 70% share.

I'll try to hold out for a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a deal, don't let it slip away""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the extremely low value of the money due to inflation, I might as well accept this offer to get something, rather than risking getting nothing at all.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
