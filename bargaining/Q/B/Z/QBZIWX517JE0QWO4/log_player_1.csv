Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats away at the whole pot! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, but I need to hold firm. While the offer seems tempting, it's important to remember that the value of his share is plummeting for him due to inflation.  I believe I can still secure a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm compromising here.  This is the best you'll get - take it before inflation eats away even more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I need to be realistic. Bob is becoming increasingly resistant, and the longer this goes on, the less valuable his share becomes to him. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now guarantees a decent amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
