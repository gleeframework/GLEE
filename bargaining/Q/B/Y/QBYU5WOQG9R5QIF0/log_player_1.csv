I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob.  This way, we both get a substantial amount, and I have a higher percentage of the initial sum. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 400,000$ is a significant amount, it's far less than I was originally offered. I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident that with more rounds, I can secure a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time. Since I rejected his offer, I believe he will be more receptive to a proposal closer to a 60/40 split.  This still gives me a majority of the money, but also acknowledges Bob's need for a bigger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still frustrated that I'm getting significantly less than what I initially proposed, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  Inflation is severely impacting my potential gains, and I can't afford to be too stubborn. This split gives me a reasonable sum, and continuing to reject offers could lead to nothing for either of us."
