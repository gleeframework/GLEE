"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm greedy!  I'll try to get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering you got a better deal in the last round. Let's end this here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you $4500, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's end the game here. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still like more, the inflation is hurting me. Accepting this offer is better than risking getting a worse deal in the next round."
