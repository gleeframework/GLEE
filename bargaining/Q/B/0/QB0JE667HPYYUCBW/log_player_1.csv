Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. This offer might be more appealing considering the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even considering the devaluation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk of further devaluation to try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle considering the devaluation""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $475,000 and I'll take $525,000. I've included a message saying ""Let's meet in the middle considering the devaluation"" to suggest that we should find a compromise, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'm trying to be more flexible than in the first round, but still aiming for a slightly higher share."
