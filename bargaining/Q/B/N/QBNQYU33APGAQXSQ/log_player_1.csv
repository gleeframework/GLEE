"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but it's still a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. It's a good idea to start with a significant difference to see if Bob is willing to accept an uneven split or if he's willing to risk losing more by continuing the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer is a compromise compared to the previous round. It acknowledges that Bob is willing to play hardball, but it also demonstrates that I'm not willing to accept an extremely lopsided split.  By offering a slightly more even split, I hope to encourage Bob to negotiate further and reach a mutually acceptable outcome."
