Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share due to the inflation.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is attempting to compromise, the deal is still significantly better for her. Accepting this offer would mean losing out on potential gains, especially considering the inflation working against her. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a better split."
