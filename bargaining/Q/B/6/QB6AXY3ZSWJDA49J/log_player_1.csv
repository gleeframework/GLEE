Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. This way, we both get an equal share before the inflation hits hard. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
