"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we'll see how the inflation plays out. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it might seem tempting to accept a quick 10$, it's better to see how the inflation affects the value of money in the future rounds. It's worth seeing what Alice proposes in the next round and how the value changes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. This way, we both get an equal share before the inflation hits hard.""}
