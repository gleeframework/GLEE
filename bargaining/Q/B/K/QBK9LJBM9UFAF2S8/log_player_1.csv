"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more balanced split, considering the risk of inflation and the fact that you proposed a very uneven split in round 1. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
