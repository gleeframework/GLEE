"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider accepting, as the value of the money decreases with each round for me, but not for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Consider this slightly more favorable offer for me. Remember, the value of the money decreases for you, but not for me, with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. My offer is 55/45 in my favor now.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share now. The value of the money hasn't changed for me, but I know it's decreasing rapidly for you. This might be your last chance to get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Although this offer is the same as Bob's initial offer, I need to factor in the rapid inflation affecting my potential gains. Accepting $4,000 now is better than risking a worse offer in a later round where the value will decrease even further."
