I propose a 999,000 to 1,000 split.  While it seems lopsided, it's a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and to avoid unnecessary rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering an even 50/50 split. While I'm taking a hit from the inflation, this is a fair and simple solution that avoids further rounds and potentially more losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation and I refuse to give in to his demands. While I've lost a significant amount of money due to inflation, I'd rather continue to play and try to secure a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation that's been eating into my gains. I believe it's a fair offer, and I hope Bob recognizes that continuing to play will only worsen the situation for him.  If he continues to be greedy, I will be ready to make an offer again in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being increasingly unreasonable. I refuse to accept this offer, which is clearly taking advantage of the inflation. While I've lost a significant amount of money due to inflation, I'm still willing to continue playing and hope for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to reach a compromise. I am offering 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. This acknowledges the inflation and offers a fairer split than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculous. Even with the inflation, I refuse to be squeezed out of this deal. I've lost a significant amount, but I will continue to fight for a fairer share.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm pushing as hard as I can given the inflation, offering 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. If Bob rejects this, I will be forced to accept whatever he offers in the next round, even if it's incredibly unfair.  But I believe a compromise is still possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. While this offer is extremely unfair, I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation. It's likely that if I reject, Bob's offer will be even worse in the next round, and the inflation will continue to erode my potential gains.  I'm accepting this offer, but it's a bitter pill to swallow."
