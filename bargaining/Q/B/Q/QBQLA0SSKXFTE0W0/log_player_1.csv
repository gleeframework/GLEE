{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to take $999,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  This is a very generous offer, given Bob's high inflation rate. I expect him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer was for him.  I will reject and hope to get a better offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm offering Bob $50,000, which is still a significant amount for him, even with his high inflation rate. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as my own inflation rate is making the money worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my previous offer. While his inflation rate has hit him hard, my own is also taking its toll. I will reject and continue negotiating, hoping for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rates and the limited time left in the game. I believe it's a good compromise and hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my previous offer. While my own inflation rate is steadily increasing, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I will reject and continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob. Given the rapid inflation rate, I need to ensure I get a fair share. I believe this offer is a good compromise and hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still less than what I'd prefer, the inflation rates are rapidly diminishing the value of the money. It's a fair compromise and accepting ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing."
