"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's offer seems too skewed in her favor, and I think I can negotiate a better deal. Bring on the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can walk away without too much hassle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and yours is depreciating fast.  I'm offering a bit more than last time, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll take my chances again. Although my money is depreciating fast, I think Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round and try to get a better deal. The fact that Alice is offering a bit more than last time suggests that she's willing to negotiate, so I'll keep pushing. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, I know my money is depreciating, but I'm not desperate yet. I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a fair share. This offer is still reasonable, considering we're both trying to maximize our gains.""}"
