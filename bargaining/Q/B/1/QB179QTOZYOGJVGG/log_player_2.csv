"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant sum. Let's avoid losing money to inflation and end this quickly. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer ensures a fairer split while still giving us a good amount. Time is ticking!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer still gives you a good share, and time is money! Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are getting progressively worse for her. While this offer is better than her first, I believe holding out a little longer could lead to an even better deal for me in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  My offer is more than fair considering the circumstances.  Let's close this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. We're both losing money by dragging this out. Let's be sensible and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of the money.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a reasonable sum that's better than what I might get if I continue to reject and we run out of rounds."
