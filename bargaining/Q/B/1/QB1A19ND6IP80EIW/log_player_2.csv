"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. 60/40 seems fair for a quick deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a better deal. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think 65/35 is a fairer split, considering we still have plenty of time to negotiate.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. 55/45 is my final offer.  We both lose if this goes on much longer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
