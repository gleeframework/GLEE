"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70 and you take 30. Let's see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'll take 60 and you take 40.  If you accept, we can both get more money.  If not, we can keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like the terms of Bob's offer. I'd rather not give up 40, but I also don't want to risk losing more in the next round due to inflation. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. With inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up too much. I'll take 55 and you take 45. Let's see if you can do better than that.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll take 55 and you take 45. This seems like a fair compromise given the inflation, and we can both get more money than if we keep rejecting each other's offers. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a compromise, and I'm not sure if I should accept it. The inflation has really taken a toll on the value of the money, and I'm not sure if 45 is a good deal for me. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger hit each round, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll aim to get as much as I can now, before the money loses even more value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more given the inflation. I'll take 65 and you take 35. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
