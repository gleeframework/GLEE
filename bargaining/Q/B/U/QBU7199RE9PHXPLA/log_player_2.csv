Alice's offer:

I'm Bob, and I'm feeling a little greedy.  Let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 6:4 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's get this over with!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the money to ensure fairness and avoid any potential dissatisfaction due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

An even split is a fair outcome given the circumstances. I'm not sure I can get more with continued rounds, and the inflation will only hurt me more in the long run."
