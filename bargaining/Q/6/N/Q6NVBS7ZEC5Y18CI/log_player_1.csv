I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. This way, I maximize my potential gain and avoid the risk of inflation eating into my share in later rounds."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  While he's offering me $10,000, I know that due to inflation, this is only worth $9,500 from the previous round's perspective.  I'm in a better position to hold out and make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm increasing my share, but still offering Bob a significant portion. I'm trying to find a balance between securing a large share and ensuring Bob has enough incentive to accept. The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to act quickly."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though it's significantly better than the previous round, I am still losing value due to inflation.  I need to be more assertive in my demands and aim for a higher share to compensate for the diminishing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}

I'm raising my share again, while still offering Bob a reasonable amount. With each round, the pressure from inflation increases, so I need to secure a larger portion. This offer is a compromise between maximizing my gain and risking Bob rejecting it."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, it still falls short of what I want. The inflation is hitting me hard, and I need to push for a larger share.  I'm hoping that the increasing inflation will force Bob to reconsider his position in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000}
```

I'm going to stick with a high share for myself but offer Bob a slightly higher share than the last round, hoping he'll be more receptive.  The inflation is making a big difference, and I need to get a good chunk of the money before it's worth significantly less."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of what I'm receiving. I'm still holding out for a larger share and hoping the pressure of inflation will make Bob more willing to negotiate."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is getting increasingly worse, and I am losing a lot of the value of the money I'm receiving.  While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it still falls significantly short of what I would consider a fair share.  There are only a few rounds left, and I need to secure a larger share to make this worthwhile.  I'm hoping that the dwindling number of rounds will put more pressure on Bob to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 980000, ""bob_gain"": 20000}
```

The inflation is becoming a serious problem. With only two rounds remaining, I need to secure a large portion of the money to compensate for the losses.  I'm raising my share again, but still offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll be more open to accepting a smaller share to avoid getting nothing at all in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money I'm receiving, I'm forced to accept Bob's offer. With no more rounds left, I'd rather get $20,000 than nothing at all.  This is a stark reminder of the dangers of inflation and how it can drastically alter the outcome of negotiations."
