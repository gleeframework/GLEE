Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Even though the inflation is hurting me, accepting this offer is the best option. The next round will have even more inflation, and I'm likely to get a worse deal. It's time to cut my losses."
