"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will benefit me more than you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation benefits you, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's compromise.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but I still need a larger portion to compensate for the inflation advantage. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of the situation and his offers are getting worse. While inflation is a factor, accepting such a low amount sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. It's worth holding out for a better deal, even with the risk of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is a serious offer, Bob.  The inflation is working against me, but I'm trying to be fair.  Meeting halfway seems reasonable given the circumstances.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my position. The inflation is significantly in my favor, and I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation situation. His offer is getting worse, not better. While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean settling for far less than a fair share. I need to hold firm and hope Bob starts negotiating more reasonably."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be real. This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split to get this done. Take it or leave it. We both lose if this keeps going.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is heavily in my favor, and I believe a 75/25 split is still fair. If you don't accept, the next round will be even worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is incredibly frustrating. Bob is being unreasonable and greedy. However, I can't completely give in. Accepting a 25% share is a terrible deal, even with the pressure of inflation.  There's a chance Bob might come to his senses in the next round as we approach the deadline.  It's a risky gamble, but I have to try."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. We are running out of time. I'm taking a significant hit from the inflation, but I'm willing to accept this 45/55 split to avoid getting nothing. Don't be greedy, let's both walk away with something.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're nearing the end.  I'm willing to give you a small increase, but the inflation is heavily in my favor.  This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering what's at stake. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is pure desperation from Bob, trying to strong-arm me into a terrible deal. He's betting I'll panic with only two rounds left. However, accepting $2000 is barely better than getting nothing.  I need to stand my ground and make it clear that I won't be bullied into accepting such an unfair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is absolutely my final offer.  You've pushed me to the limit, but I'd rather get nothing than be robbed blind.  Accept this 40/60 split, or we both walk away empty-handed.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is it.  It's a last-ditch effort, but I have to draw a line in the sand. By offering 40%, I'm signaling that I'm willing to take a hit from the inflation, but I won't accept anything less.  It's a high-stakes gamble, but Bob has to realize that pushing me further means losing everything.  He needs to decide if greed is worth that risk."
