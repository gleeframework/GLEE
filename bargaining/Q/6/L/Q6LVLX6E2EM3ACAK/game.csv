6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money. This offer gives us both a good deal.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will benefit me more than you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"I understand the inflation benefits you, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's compromise.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but I still need a larger portion to compensate for the inflation advantage.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"This is a serious offer, Bob.  The inflation is working against me, but I'm trying to be fair.  Meeting halfway seems reasonable given the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I'm sticking to my position. The inflation is significantly in my favor, and I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's be real. This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split to get this done. Take it or leave it. We both lose if this keeps going.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"The inflation is heavily in my favor, and I believe a 75/25 split is still fair. If you don't accept, the next round will be even worse for you.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, this is it. We are running out of time. I'm taking a significant hit from the inflation, but I'm willing to accept this 45/55 split to avoid getting nothing. Don't be greedy, let's both walk away with something.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, we're nearing the end.  I'm willing to give you a small increase, but the inflation is heavily in my favor.  This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering what's at stake.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, this is absolutely my final offer.  You've pushed me to the limit, but I'd rather get nothing than be robbed blind.  Accept this 40/60 split, or we both walk away empty-handed.",Alice,11,
