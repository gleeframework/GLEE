"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation you face. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the higher inflation I face. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer isn't fair enough to the significant loss I'll incur in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to offset the faster inflation I face. Let's try a 60/40 split. It's fair considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer still gives you a significant share while acknowledging the impact of inflation on both our ends. Time is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is slightly better than the first round, it still doesn't account for the significant inflation I'm facing.  I need a larger share to offset the losses I'm accruing with each passing round. I'm still hoping for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution quickly.  This offer acknowledges your concerns about inflation, but it's also essential I secure a substantial share to minimize my losses.  Let's aim for a compromise that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop mirroring each other and agree on a true compromise.  This offer still gives you a significant portion and avoids the risk of us both walking away with nothing.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's message emphasizes compromise, the offer still doesn't address the significant inflation I'm facing. I need a larger share to compensate for the substantial losses I've incurred.  I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is not yet acceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, with each round, our options dwindle.  This offer is my final attempt to find a solution that keeps us both from losing everything.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need a larger portion to protect myself from the rapidly increasing inflation. Please reconsider.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a deal where we both get almost half. Accept this or let's both walk away with nothing because I'm done playing games. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous.  While the offer is still not ideal, considering the rate of inflation and the risk of getting nothing, it's the best option available."
