I propose a 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm offering 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. This is a compromise, as I'm willing to give up some of my previous share, but I still need to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm willing to go down to 700,000 for myself, hoping to reach an agreement with Bob. The inflation is taking its toll, so we need to find a solution soon."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is still an unacceptable deal, considering the inflation.  We're too far apart in our expectations.  I believe we can both do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm dropping my share again to 600,000.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it shows good faith and could lead to an agreement.  The time is running out, and we need to find common ground."
