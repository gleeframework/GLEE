"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but not completely equal, split.  I believe this offer is reasonable considering the potential for inflation later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair, it's too much of a disadvantage for me. I'm going to try to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more equitable, reflecting the risk of inflation. Let's try this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 55/45 split again.  I think this is a fair compromise, and it avoids the risk of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While a 55/45 split isn't ideal, I'm worried about the risk of further inflation.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
