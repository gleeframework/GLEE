"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something to encourage him to accept.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, I'm aware of the inflation and taking a 5% hit. Accepting Bob's offer is the best way to ensure I get at least something."
