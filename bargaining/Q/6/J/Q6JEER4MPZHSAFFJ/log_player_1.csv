"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my 20$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's 80$ is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the reduced value of money. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. My goal is to get a better deal than the 20$ I would get from the previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's share the money equally""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to give you a better deal than last time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the continued inflation, my 40$ is worth 86.8% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's 60$ is worth 48% of what it was in the first round. The offer is a bit better than the 20$ I would get from the previous offer, but still not ideal. I'll accept the offer.
