"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively aggressive offer. I'm confident I can get a good deal, but I'll be willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is a real threat. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
