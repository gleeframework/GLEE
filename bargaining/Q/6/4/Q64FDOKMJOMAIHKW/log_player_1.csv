"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in the next round if he rejects this one."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a much smaller share, hoping to get a better deal before the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to think carefully. Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable than it did in previous rounds. I'll accept his offer.
