"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100 and leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already hitting us hard!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 20% less, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. However, it's still a decent chunk of change, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting even less.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
