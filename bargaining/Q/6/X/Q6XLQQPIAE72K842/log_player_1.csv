"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure I should get the majority since I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see how Bob feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take 5% than risk getting nothing at all. Plus, the next round could be even worse!"
