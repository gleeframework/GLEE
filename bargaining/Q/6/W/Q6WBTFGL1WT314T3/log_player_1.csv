"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to see if he'll accept, but I'm aware of the inflation and will need to be more aggressive in the next rounds if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least something, and it's better than losing everything due to inflation."
