"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is my first offer. I am taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a very aggressive strategy, but with the inflation risk, I want to maximize my potential gains in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a very unfair offer. While my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, Bob's gain is only worth 5% less.  I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm adjusting my strategy.  While I still want a larger share, I'm offering Bob a more significant portion this time. This acknowledges the inflation effect, and hopefully, it's enough to encourage him to accept, avoiding further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair. While my gains are worth 27.1% less than in the first round, his are only worth 14.26% less. I need to try and get a better deal, even though the inflation is hitting my potential earnings hard."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking a more significant risk by offering Bob a larger share. I need to be more aggressive in negotiations to secure a good deal. This offer reflects the increasing inflation and Bob's previous rejection, showing willingness to compromise for a quicker resolution."
