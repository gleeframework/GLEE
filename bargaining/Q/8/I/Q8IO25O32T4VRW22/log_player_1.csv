Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with this deal.  I'll keep a close eye on that inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob gets an equal share, it's still a good deal for me.  With the inflation, if we go to another round, Bob's offer will be worth even less to him, and my share might even decrease."
