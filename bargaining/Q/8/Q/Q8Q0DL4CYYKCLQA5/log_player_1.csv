"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose that Alice receives $99 and Bob receives $1.  This is a very lopsided offer in my favor, but since Bob's money is worth less with each round, I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, Bob gets to make the next offer, and since his money is worth less with each round, he'll likely offer me even less in the next round."
