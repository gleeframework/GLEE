"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $100,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the fairest way to start. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split it evenly, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You said it was fair to split it evenly, but I think I'm worth more than you, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $300,000. My message is a bit cheeky, trying to get under Bob's skin."

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to sweeten the deal by offering a 40/60 split, which is more favorable to him than my previous offer. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this compromise.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40/60 split, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $200,000. My message is a bit condescending, trying to assert my dominance in the negotiation."

# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a final push for a deal. However, I'm not convinced that a 35/65 split is reasonable, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, Bob. The value is plummeting!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with a relatively small amount. My message is a bit forceful, trying to convey a sense of urgency and finality."
