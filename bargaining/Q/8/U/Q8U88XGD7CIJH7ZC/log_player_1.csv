"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering your offer last round.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that's the same as my initial offer, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still get the majority of the money.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's agree on this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share of the money now that the value of the money is decreasing. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Equal split, let's get it over with.""
}
```

I'm now offering an equal split, which is a more reasonable proposal given the decreasing value of the money."
