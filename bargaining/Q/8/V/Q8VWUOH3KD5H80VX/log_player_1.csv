"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
