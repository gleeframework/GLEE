"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars and taking 80 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can have 70, and I'll take 30. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I was hoping for a better deal, considering the inflation is already reducing my potential gain. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to reduce the value of the money, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time. You can have 40, and I'll take 60. It's a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars and taking 60 dollars for myself, hoping it's a better deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more this time. You can have 55, and I'll take 45. It's getting closer to a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. The 55 dollars I'll get is still less than I initially wanted, but it's a better deal than what I'll get in the next round, considering the inflation. I'll take what I can get and hope it's a fair compromise.
