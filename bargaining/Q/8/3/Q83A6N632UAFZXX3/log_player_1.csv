"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

 I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly. I believe this is a fair starting point, allowing for negotiation in later rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a better split, with inflation the value of my gains has significantly reduced. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $6000, which is more than I would likely get if I rejected and risked losing even more due to inflation in the next round."
