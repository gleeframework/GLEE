"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good starting point, but let's be realistic. Given the inflation, getting this deal done sooner rather than later benefits both of us.  I'm proposing a 45/55 split. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
