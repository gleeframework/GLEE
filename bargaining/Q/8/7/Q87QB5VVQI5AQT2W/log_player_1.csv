"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider the actual value of the proposal:

50 (Alice's gain) = 54 (original value)
50 (Bob's gain) = 55 (original value)

It seems like Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.
