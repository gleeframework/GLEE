Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 30% for me. This 60-40 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
