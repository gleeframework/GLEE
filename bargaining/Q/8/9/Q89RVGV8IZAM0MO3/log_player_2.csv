"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I lose money faster with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's proposal is ""reasonable"" in the sense that it gives Bob a larger share, it doesn't account for the fact that the money's value decreases more rapidly for Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity in the previous round, but I believe a more balanced approach considering the inflation rates is necessary. Let's split the money closer to 55/45 in my favor to account for the faster rate of inflation you experience. This ensures a more equitable outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation rates. However, your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a much fairer offer that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more favorable split, Alice's offer is more reasonable than my previous attempt. The inflation rates are heavily impacting her, and this offer recognizes that. Accepting this will ensure a fair outcome for both of us."
