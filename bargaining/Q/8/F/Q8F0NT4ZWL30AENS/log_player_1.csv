"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

 I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems fair as we both get a substantial amount, and I'm taking a slight advantage as I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  My gains are significantly less than the previous round, and rejecting the offer will likely result in a further decrease."
