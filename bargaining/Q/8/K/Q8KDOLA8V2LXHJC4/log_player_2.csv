Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'm not sure this is a fair deal yet, given how the money will inflate differently for each of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair given the inflation rates. Let's see what you think!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think 58/42 is the fairest split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is slightly better for me than my previous offer after accounting for the inflation. I think it's a fair compromise."
