"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. In the first round, I was offered 500,000, which is now worth 80% of its original value, or 400,000.

Bob's offer of 400,000 is actually a slightly lower amount than what I could have gotten in the first round, considering inflation. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
