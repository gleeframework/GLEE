"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but I'm willing to start with a generous offer to see if Bob will accept. I'm hoping to reach a solution quickly, before inflation significantly impacts our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, I think it's wise to accept. The inflation rate means that waiting for another round might result in even less money for me. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing in the end."
