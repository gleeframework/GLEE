Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a seemingly generous offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%.  This is to establish a baseline and see how Bob responds.  I'm anticipating that he might reject this offer and propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I initially aimed for a more lopsided split, the inflation factor is already impacting my potential gains significantly.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the current circumstances, and it guarantees me a substantial amount even with the inflation.  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further inflation and a potentially less favorable deal in the next round."
