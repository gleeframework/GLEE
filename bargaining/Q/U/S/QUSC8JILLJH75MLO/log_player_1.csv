"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50-50 split, and I'm willing to take the equal share to avoid risking more in future rounds."
