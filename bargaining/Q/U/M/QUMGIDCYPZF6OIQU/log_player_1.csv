"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54
Bob's gain: 40 * 0.95 = 38

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2 due to inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share. Your turn!""
}
```

My gain is now worth 45 * 0.9 = 40.5, and Bob's gain is 55 * 0.95 = 52.25. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
