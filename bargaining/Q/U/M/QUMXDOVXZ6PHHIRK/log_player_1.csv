"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is generous, but the stakes are high.  Let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? This accounts for the time value of money for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
