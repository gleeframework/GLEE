"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  It's a good starting point, and we can adjust later if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. While 100,000$ is a significant sum, waiting even a single round could potentially yield a better outcome for Bob, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer is generous, but the stakes are high.  Let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? This accounts for the time value of money for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the time value of money.  Let's compromise. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. This keeps things moving forward while still respecting our individual interests. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one!  While it's less than Bob wanted in Round 2, waiting any longer significantly risks his potential gains due to the steep inflation. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
