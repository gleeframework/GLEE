I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate a more even split.  Let's see what Alice offers next."

I'm offering a split of 550,000 for me and 450,000 for Alice. This is a more even split, and I think it's a fair starting point for negotiations."
