"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth less than my gain in the first round. But it's still a decent offer. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
