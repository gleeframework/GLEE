"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?  It's still in your favor considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, the inflation is hitting you harder. Let's be realistic. I'll bump my offer up a bit to show some goodwill. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is still not generous enough. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, this inflation is hurting both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers last round.  Let's close this deal and get our money.""}"
