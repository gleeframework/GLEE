I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll be tempted to accept it quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is offering me $1,000, which is a much better deal than my initial offer.  While I could try to get a little more, I'd rather take what's offered and be done with it.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
