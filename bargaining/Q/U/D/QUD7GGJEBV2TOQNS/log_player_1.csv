This is a tough one! Here's why I decided to accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less my potential gains are worth due to inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him getting increasingly greedy in future rounds. There's a chance he'll offer even less next time, and I'll be forced to accept even less than $4,000 (after inflation).
* **""Bird in the Hand...""**  While $4,000 is less than I wanted, it's better than walking away with nothing if the negotiations completely fall apart. 

It's a gamble, but in this scenario, accepting the sure thing is the most logical choice given the circumstances."
