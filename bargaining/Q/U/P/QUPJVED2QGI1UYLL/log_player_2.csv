"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a 60/40 split in my favor, but keep in mind that the money is worth 10% less due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the 4500 I'll gain in this round is equivalent to 5000 in the first round, which is a decent amount. I'll accept Alice's offer this time.
