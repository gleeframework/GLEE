"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and ensures we both benefit from this division. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to accept a 50/50 split, but with the inflation factor, I can likely get a better deal later.  I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for future inflation.  Let's work together to make the most of this opportunity.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation factor, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. This acknowledges the potential decrease in value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I need to be realistic.  Alice's offer is fair, considering the inflation, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
