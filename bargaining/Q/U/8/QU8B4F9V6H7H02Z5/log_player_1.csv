"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a division of $99 for myself and $1 for Bob.  This maximizes my potential gain in the first round, but leaves open the possibility of negotiation in future rounds if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While $10 is better than nothing, it's still a very small share of the money. Since I know the inflation is hurting Bob more than me, I can leverage this to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 60, hoping to strike a balance between getting a decent amount and leaving room for negotiation in future rounds. Bob is likely feeling the pressure from inflation, and this offer might be more appealing than the previous round's."
