Round 2

Let's go for a classic 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids the risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round! I'm not happy with the current offer, considering the inflation effects."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to swing the deal in my favor a bit. I'm offering Alice 400,000, which is still more than her current offer, and I'm taking the rest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, even considering inflation, so I'm sticking with my strategy of trying to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to up the ante again, offering Alice a smaller amount while increasing my share. I'm hoping she'll see the value in accepting this offer before the inflation hits even harder."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. While the offer is still lower than my initial goal, the inflation is starting to hit hard. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
