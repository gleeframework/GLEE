Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. It's a better deal for you since the money is losing value faster for you than it is for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
