"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being a bit greedy, isn't he?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. I don't think I'm willing to give Bob 70% of the money, especially considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor, but still a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finding a mutually beneficial deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking more now! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreased value of money, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm also not eager to continue negotiating and risk losing even more value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, unfortunately. I'll take $2,000 and hope that Bob is satisfied."
