""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm willing to go slightly higher.  Let's split the money 60/40, with me taking 60% to account for our inflation rates.  This offers a better outcome for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
