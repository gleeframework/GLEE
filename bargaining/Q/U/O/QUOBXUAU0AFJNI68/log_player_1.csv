"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. While your proposal acknowledges the inflation, I believe a 60/40 split is more reflective of the risk I'm taking by potentially delaying the agreement. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
