"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer, let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is a bit more in his favor. However, I think it's still a decent offer considering the reduced value of money.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
