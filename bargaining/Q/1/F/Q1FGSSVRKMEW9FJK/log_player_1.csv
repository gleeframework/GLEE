"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering you $30, and I'll take the remaining $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $60, which is equivalent to $48 in the first round's value. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation taking a bigger toll each round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm taking a bigger share this time, but I'm still leaving you with a significant amount."
