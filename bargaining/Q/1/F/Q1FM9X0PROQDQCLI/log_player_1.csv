"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering you 4000, and I'll take 6000. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting, and my offer is now worth less!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 40-60 split, especially considering the value of my share is decreasing due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, trying to account for the decreasing value of my share due to inflation."
