"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not sure how inflation will affect things for Alice, but I want to see if I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering you 4000, and I'll take 6000. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is a factor.  I'm willing to compromise and accept Alice's offer."
