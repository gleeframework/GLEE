"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable and fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased by 20% due to inflation, so my potential gain is now worth less.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob taking a larger share, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but still a fair offer!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give myself a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to get a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is still offering a relatively fair share, I'll think carefully about this offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal and accept Bob's offer. It's not the best I could have gotten, but it's better than going into the next round with even less value."
