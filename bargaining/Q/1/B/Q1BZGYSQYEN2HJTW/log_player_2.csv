"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more but you still get a lot 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

It's a good starting point, but I can probably get more.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can find a more fair split. I'm willing to give you a bit more this time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, let's settle on this 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is still better than what I offered in round 2, and the inflation is starting to hurt. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
