# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe we can find a better division. Let's continue the game and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, let's close this deal before it's too late for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the value of the money is decreasing for me, I still believe that Alice's offer is not fair. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the game to try to get a better deal. The difference in the value of the money for me and Alice is significant, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Let's proceed to the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the value is dropping. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, but I'm not convinced that Alice's offer is fair, even considering the circumstances. The fact that the value of the money remains the same for Alice puts me at a significant disadvantage. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to find a more balanced agreement. Let's proceed to the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand the urgency, but I'm not willing to settle for an unfair deal.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous. The deal is getting worse for you every round. Let's be smart and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand Alice's frustration, but the fact remains that the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me while remaining constant for her. This asymmetry puts me at a considerable disadvantage. Despite the decreasing value, I'm not ready to accept an offer that doesn't adequately compensate for this disparity. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to find a more equitable solution. Let's proceed to the next round."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting painful. I'm meeting you in the middle.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's message suggests she is meeting me in the middle, the offer still doesn't adequately address the significant disparity caused by the inflation, which affects me disproportionately. Given the substantial decrease in value for my share, I feel compelled to continue seeking a better deal, despite the risk of further devaluation. Let's proceed to the next round."
