40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rates. I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the faster devaluation of my money.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's try a 55/45 split instead.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but it's important to me to still receive a majority.",Alice,3,

30.0,70.0,"I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to compensate for the continued devaluation of my money. A 70/30 split reflects the current inflation rates.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try a 40/60 split.  This reflects the current inflation rates, but also acknowledges that we both need to find a solution before the money devalues further.",Alice,5,
