"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is greedy or if he's willing to negotiate.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping to get most of the money and still have plenty of time to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm starting to adjust to the reality of inflation. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but it's still significantly less than what he proposed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to exploit inflation. I'm not going to let him take 90% of the money, even with inflation. I'll keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a significantly larger share than before.  The time is running out, and I need to get closer to a 50/50 split to avoid getting nothing. I'm hoping Bob is willing to accept this offer to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too high for me. While inflation is affecting the value of the money, I'm not willing to accept 30% of the money when I'm still capable of offering a better counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm finally offering a 50/50 split.  We are now halfway through the game, and I need to start thinking about the risks. If we don't come to an agreement soon, the value of the money will continue to decrease, and we'll both lose out."
