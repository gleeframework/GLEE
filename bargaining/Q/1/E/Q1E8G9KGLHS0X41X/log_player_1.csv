I'm taking a cautious approach in the first round. I'm offering Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept, but keeping the majority for myself.  I want to see if he's willing to play along with my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my initial offer, but I'm not going to accept it yet. I still have a chance to improve my own gains. Even though my share is worth 5% less in this round, I believe I can get a better deal by playing it smart."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try and push for a larger share again. Even though Bob's offer was good,  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
