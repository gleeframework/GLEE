I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, Alice.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this as a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8500/1500.  I think this is still a fair offer considering the inflation rate.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob is getting greedy. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm going to reduce my offer again, but I believe it's still a reasonable split. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that the inflation is starting to hurt him more than me and that it's time to reach an agreement."

Bob is getting even more greedy. I'm starting to think he's going to push this to the very end, and we'll both lose out.  But I'm still going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to make another concession. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both starting to lose out here with the inflation."
