"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is my initial offer. I am giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept, but I want to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's not as if we're starting from scratch.  Bob still remembers the original offer, and I'm sure he realizes that he's going to have to come back with a slightly more equitable offer if he wants to ensure a deal.  Let's see what happens in round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. It's important to be fair but also to remember that the money is losing value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than 30% of the money.  Let's see if he can come up with something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob.  It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, especially with the inflation factor.  Let's see if this offer is more successful!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  However, with only 6 rounds left, I think I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come back with a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

This is a risky move, but I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair share. I'm reducing my portion again, but I'm hoping that this will finally convince Bob to accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing.  It's getting really tight now!"
