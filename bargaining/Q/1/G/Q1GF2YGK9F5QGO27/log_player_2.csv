Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option and avoids further losses from inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. I'm offering a slight advantage for me, considering the inflation is affecting you more.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me, but I still want a fair share. Meet me in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is moving closer to a 50/50 split. While she's framed it as a ""fair share,"" the longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll become. I'm betting I can get a better deal than 45 in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, and my rejections show I'm willing to walk away. By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to push her to accept a deal that favors me before the value drops further for her."
