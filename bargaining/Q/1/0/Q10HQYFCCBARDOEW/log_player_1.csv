"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slightly bigger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly this time.  Let's be fair, and I'll take a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. He's still trying to take a slightly larger share, and I'm not sure why he thinks this is a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share considering my initial proposal""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
