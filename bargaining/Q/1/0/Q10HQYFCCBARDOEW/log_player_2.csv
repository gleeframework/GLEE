"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm hoping the inflation will incentivize Alice to offer me a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly this time.  Let's be fair, and I'll take a slightly larger share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share considering my initial proposal 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still like to see a more even split, the inflation is making this offer more appealing. I'm willing to accept to avoid further losses due to inflation."
