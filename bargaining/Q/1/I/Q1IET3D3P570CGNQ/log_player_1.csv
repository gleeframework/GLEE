"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 6000 and Bob gets 4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to reconsider, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get the same value for 3000 as I would have in the first round. However, for Bob, the 7000 is worth 10% less than his initial 4000, which is 3600.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I get 4500 and Bob gets 5500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you an even split, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get the same value for 5000 as I would have in the first round. For Bob, the 5000 is worth 27.1% less than his initial 4000, which is 2920.

I'm tempted to accept the offer, as it's an even split, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll accept this offer, but I'll keep an eye on future offers.
