6000.0,4000.0,I propose dividing the money into 6000 and 4000 dollars. This ensures a fair split considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the money is losing value each round. This ensures we both get a decent share before the value drops too much.,Bob,2,
