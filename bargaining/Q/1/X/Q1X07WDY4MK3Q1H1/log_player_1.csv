"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a fairly standard starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of its original value. However, the split is still a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), and Bob's gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer."
