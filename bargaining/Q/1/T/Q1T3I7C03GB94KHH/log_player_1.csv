Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but this is my bottom line. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's analyze why rejecting is the better strategy:

* **Current Offer:** Bob's offer gives you $4500. 
* **Next Round Potential:** If you reject, in the next round the total value will be $9,000 ($8,100 for you, $900 for Bob). Even if you propose to take a slightly smaller share than Bob is offering now (e.g., $4400), you'll still likely get a better deal than $4500 because you control the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob's message implies he might be getting anxious as the value decreases quickly for him. This gives you leverage.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of you. However, it depreciates much faster for Bob. 

**By rejecting, you put the pressure on Bob and can likely secure a better deal in the next round.**"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's end this. A 50/50 split is fair and we both lose less to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Time Pressure:** By round 3, the pot's value has diminished significantly for both players. It's crucial to settle quickly.
2. **Fairness Appeal:** Offering a 50/50 split can be psychologically appealing. It suggests you're willing to compromise and presents a simple, justifiable solution. 
3. **Bob's Loss Aversion:**  Bob's money is depreciating faster. The longer the game goes on, the more desperate he might become, making him potentially accept an offer he would have rejected earlier.

While we could try to push for a slightly higher gain, the risk of Bob rejecting and the value decreasing further might not be worth it. A 50/50 split ensures a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
