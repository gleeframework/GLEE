"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you get 20%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and I'm leaving room for negotiation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. A 50/50 split seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to be careful with the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I don't want to give up 50% of the remaining value, so I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 50% of the remaining value, Bob. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 10% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 60/40 split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want to keep the majority.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. I think 60/40 is still a bit too skewed in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. With the 27.1% inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth significantly less than in the first round. I don't want to give up too much more.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with this offer, Bob. I'll try to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll! The money I gain is now worth 41.3% less than in the first round.

I'll make a new offer that tries to account for the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to find a middle ground, Bob. I'll take 55% of the remaining value, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than before.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, Alice. I think it's time to make a more aggressive offer. I'll take 70% of the remaining value, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than before. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really accelerating!

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive, and the value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Considering the 40.95% inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth even less than in the previous round. I don't want to give up too much more, but I also don't want to risk getting nothing.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with your aggressive offer, Bob. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I'm starting to get worried.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll! The money I gain is now worth 54.7% less than in the first round.

I'll make a new offer that tries to account for the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's do a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out.""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will take this offer, as it's a fair split and I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate."
