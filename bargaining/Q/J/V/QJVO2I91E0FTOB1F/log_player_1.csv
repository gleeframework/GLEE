**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Accepting $5,000 now, even with a 48.8% inflation hit, is better than risking getting a worse deal in later rounds.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the future is highly risky. Each round makes the potential gains less and less appealing due to inflation. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on a 50/50 split. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better, especially as he's experiencing less inflation.

Waiting longer only benefits Bob. Accepting now cuts losses and ensures a reasonable, albeit not perfect, payout."
