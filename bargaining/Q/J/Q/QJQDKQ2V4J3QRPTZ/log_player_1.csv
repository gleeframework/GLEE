"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. Let's be a little more strategic, since the money depreciates for you faster.  I'll take 6000, and leave 4000 for you.  This way, we both get more value from the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
