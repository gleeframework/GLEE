"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. The message is a friendly invitation to consider this reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 75% of the remaining amount, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a more balanced split?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to the initial 60-40 split I suggested in round 1, but with a bit more concession to Bob's request for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I think I can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money continuing to lose value due to inflation, I'm not eager to give up more than I have to. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a larger share, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, a fair and equal split?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced and equal division of the remaining amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
