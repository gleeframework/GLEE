"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, hoping he'll see this as a generous and fair starting point, considering we both want to avoid the devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair, now it's my turn to propose a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as it gives me a smaller share than I initially proposed. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}


I've reduced my initial offer by 20,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway and show that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and the money is shrinking. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with:


{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think Bob's offer is reasonable at this point. I'd rather secure a smaller amount now than risk getting even less in subsequent rounds or, worse, getting nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds."
