Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a risky strategy. I'll offer Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it to get something rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I initially tried a risky strategy, it's clear Bob is willing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, which is a much safer outcome than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
