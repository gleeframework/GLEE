I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to maximize my gains in the first round, while still leaving something for Bob to consider. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I have to consider the inflation factor.  My share is worth less now, and if I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get anything in the next round. It's better to take the $1000 now."
