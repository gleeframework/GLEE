Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is a factor for both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
