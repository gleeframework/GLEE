Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer, let's try meeting in the middle of our last offers. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, we're still in the early rounds. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on and allows for the possibility of securing a better deal in a future round."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, let's swap numbers from your last offer and see if that works. 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly aiming for a 512,500 / 487,500 split.  While not ideal, it's better to accept a slightly unfavorable deal now than to risk getting a worse offer or even reaching round 12 and getting nothing."
