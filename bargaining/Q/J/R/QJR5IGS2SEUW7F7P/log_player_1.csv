"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I need to consider the relative value of the amounts. I'd rather take a smaller amount now and have more control over the remaining rounds, but I also don't want to give Bob too much of a head start.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, my offer needs to adjust accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think this is a fair split. Don't wait too long, the value of the money is dropping!""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself to maintain some bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses due to inflation! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly! I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 70% share. I'd rather try to get a better deal, but I also don't want to risk losing everything.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting worried about inflation, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. Don't expect any more generous offers from me!""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up much more. I need to be more cautious with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better deal. This is my last chance to make a move! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting! I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 75% share, but I also don't want to risk getting nothing.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll accept this offer. It's a risk, but I'd rather take a smaller share now and avoid the possibility of getting nothing.
