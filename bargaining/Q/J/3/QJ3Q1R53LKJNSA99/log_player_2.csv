"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but you'll get a better deal next time if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""My turn to make a strong opening. This offer gives me a good share, and you still get a decent amount. Consider that the value decreases over time.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take less, but I'm not going to accept being taken advantage of. This is a fair deal, and we can both avoid the risk of getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is compromising, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's worth taking the risk of further inflation to try and secure a better share for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be reasonable. I've lowered my initial ask, acknowledging the need for compromise. This offer is fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the end. Time is ticking!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm holding firm on my desired share, but I'm also willing to make concessions for the sake of reaching a deal. This offer is fair and leaves room for both of us to gain something. Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the time pressure, the offer is barely better than her previous one. Given the accelerating inflation for Bob, it's still worthwhile to gamble on getting a better deal in the remaining rounds. A 60/40 split heavily favors Alice, especially considering the time value of money for Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. I'm meeting you closer to the middle ground, but this is as low as I can go.  We both need to gain something from this. Let's be realistic and end this before the money is worth even less for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. This offer is fair and avoids the risk of us both getting nothing. Let's end this game and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is quickly eroding Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, Alice offering a 55/45 split is barely acceptable at this stage. Accepting now guarantees Bob gets something, while continuing the game carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing if a deal isn't reached quickly."
