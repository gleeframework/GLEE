"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'm not too thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
