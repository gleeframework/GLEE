"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nMy offer is to take $600,000 for myself and give $400,000 to Bob. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be reasonable, but let's make it a bit more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 5% less, Bob's offer of $550,000 is actually worth $522,500 in real terms. Considering this, I still think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject Bob's offer.
### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 10% less (5% less in each of the first two rounds), I'll adjust my offer to try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. I'll propose a division that gives me $580,000 and Bob $420,000, considering the decreased value of the money for me.
### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 14.26% less, Bob's offer of $530,000 is actually worth approximately $454,622 in real terms. Given that Bob claims this is his final offer and considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
