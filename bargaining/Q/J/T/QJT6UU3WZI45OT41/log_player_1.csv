"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is fair.  Let's end this quickly and avoid inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $475,000.

I'm not sure I want to give up the extra $125,000 I could get from the original proposal, but the 50/50 split is a reasonable offer and it would be good to end the game quickly to avoid further inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90.25% of the original amount (95% * 95%), which is $454,750.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not going to give up too much.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 60.5% of the original amount (85.74% * 85.74% * 95% * 95%), which is $242,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's worth less than what I could get from the original proposal. However, the game has been going on for a few rounds, and I don't want to risk further inflation.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 13.88% of the original amount (85.74% * 85.74% * 95% * 95%), which is $138,800.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. This is my final offer.""
}
