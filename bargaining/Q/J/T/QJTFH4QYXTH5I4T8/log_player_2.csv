"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that Alice's money will depreciate at a faster rate than mine. I want to see if I can get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering our different inflation rates.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share due to my lower inflation rate. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  Alice is being more reasonable with her counter-offers, and the shrinking value of the money means I need to secure a deal.  This offer gives me a good chunk of the money, and I can live with a 45/55 split."
