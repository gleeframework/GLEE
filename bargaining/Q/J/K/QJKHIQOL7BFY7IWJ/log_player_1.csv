Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a more equitable starting point, and hopefully, we can avoid more rounds of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
