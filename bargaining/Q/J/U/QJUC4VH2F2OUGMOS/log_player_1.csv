Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk losing everything by being too greedy."
