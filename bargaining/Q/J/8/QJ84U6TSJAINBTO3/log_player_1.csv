"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to think carefully. Here's my decision:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2 due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share of the reduced amount, taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, Bob's offer seems reasonable. Here's my decision:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as the money is worth significantly less now, and this seems like a decent split."
