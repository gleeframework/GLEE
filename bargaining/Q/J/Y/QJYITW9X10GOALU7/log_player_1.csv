"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this amount accounts for the decreasing value over time.  This offer gets us closer to a fair split in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than half. Let's settle this!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This back and forth isn't benefiting either of us. I propose a simple 50/50 split. It's the fairest option, especially considering the increasing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think Bob's offer is reasonable, considering the increasing inflation and the fact that we're already on round 4. A 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. Let's settle this and move on!"
