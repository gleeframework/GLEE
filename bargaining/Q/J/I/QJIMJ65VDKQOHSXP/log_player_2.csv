"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we both lose with every round. I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair 50/50 split.  I'm losing money with each round, so let's be reasonable and end this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my previous offer.  It's clear that waiting any longer will only hurt us both.  Let's be rational and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm, but the deal is getting significantly worse for me with each round.  While I risk getting nothing if this goes to the final round, the potential loss from accepting this offer is too great. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a compromise that reflects the urgency of the situation.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. By presenting this as my ""final offer"", I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. I need her to believe I'm willing to walk away, even if it means getting nothing. This offer is still slightly in her favor, but the decreasing value due to inflation makes each round increasingly risky for me."
