Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's be reasonable and end this before the money shrinks even more. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of our gains, Bob's offer seems reasonable at this point, especially since the difference in inflation rates is quite high. Continuing further might not yield a significantly better outcome for me and could result in both of us losing more value. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer to minimize further loss due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI hope this decision concludes the game on a mutually acceptable note, considering the circumstances."
