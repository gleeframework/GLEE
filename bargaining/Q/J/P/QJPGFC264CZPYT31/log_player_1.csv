"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a relatively generous starting offer, and I'll take the remaining 600,000 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bit more, I'm the one making the proposal now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $300,000 x 0.95 = $285,000
Bob gain: $700,000 x 0.95 = $665,000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll decide to accept this offer to move on to the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
