"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000.  This division reflects that both our time is valuable, and we risk losing money if this drags on.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's be fair to each other, time is valuable but so is a fair split. I propose 4500 for me and 5500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
