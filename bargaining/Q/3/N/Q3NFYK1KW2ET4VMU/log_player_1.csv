"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual value of the 50 I'd get from Bob's offer to be 54.4 (100% - 10% = 90%, so 50 * 0.9 = 45, then 45 * 1.2 = 54.4).

Similarly, since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, the actual value of the 50 he'd get is 62.5 (100% - 20% = 80%, so 50 * 0.8 = 40, then 40 * 1.56 = 62.5).

Considering these values, I think Bob's offer is a good one, as I'd be getting a slightly higher value than I would have in the first round. So, I'll...
