Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal, even with the inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round."

I'm going to push for a bigger share, aiming for a 70/30 split. This might be my best chance to maximize my gains before inflation hits harder."
