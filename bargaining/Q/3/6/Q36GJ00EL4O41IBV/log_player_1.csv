"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to negotiate, eh?

I'll consider his offer, but I'm not sure if it's good enough. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be cautious. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get left with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! With the money worth 27.1% less than the original, I need to be careful.

Bob's offer is a bit better, but I'm still not sure if it's the best deal. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting a worse deal due to further inflation."
