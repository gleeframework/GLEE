Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller payout, even if we were to secure a slightly better deal in a later round.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows time is on his side due to the inflation mechanic. His offer, while still favoring him, is unlikely to improve drastically in a potential Round 5. He's likely to propose something marginally better at best, which wouldn't outweigh the losses from inflation.
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees a payout now. Rejecting carries the risk of Bob proposing an even worse deal in a future round, leaving us with a much smaller amount.

It's important to recognize that in games with shrinking resources and time pressure, securing a reasonable gain often outweighs holding out for the ideal outcome."
