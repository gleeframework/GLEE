"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 3:1, I'll take the smaller share for now""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, giving me $750,000 and Bob $250,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $475,000
* Bob gain: $475,000

I'll accept this offer.
