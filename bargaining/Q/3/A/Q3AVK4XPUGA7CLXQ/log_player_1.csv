"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, aiming to secure the money quickly while keeping the risk of inflation low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation risk is growing, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome. Accepting ensures we both get something."
