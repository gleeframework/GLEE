I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  Let's see if he accepts this offer!"

I'm going to try and get a bit more this time.  I'll offer Bob $3,000, hoping he'll see this as a better deal than the last round."

Bob's offer is getting increasingly favorable to him due to inflation, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. It's time to accept."
