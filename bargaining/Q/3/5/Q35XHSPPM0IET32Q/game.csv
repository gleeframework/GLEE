6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you 40% and I'll take 60%. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think 55% for me is a bit more fair, considering the money loses value for me with each round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Okay, let's split it down the middle this time. Since the money is losing value for both of us, a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option now. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the money is worth even less to me now, I think 60% is a reasonable ask. Let's settle this before it's worth even less.",Bob,4,
