"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even with inflation, this is a much better deal for me than the previous round. Accepting this offer ensures a substantial gain, and I don't want to risk losing more money in subsequent rounds."
