"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'll start with a slightly unfair offer, keeping 90% for myself. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept quickly, as each round reduces the value of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get in the next round with inflation factored in.  It's time to secure what I can."
