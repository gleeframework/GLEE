# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing a tough game, but she clearly isn't interested in a fair deal. I need to hold strong, even though the inflation is eating into my potential gains. It's getting riskier, but accepting a deal this low sets a bad precedent."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with only three rounds left and inflation eroding my potential gains significantly, I need to cut my losses. Accepting Alice's offer, while far from ideal, is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
