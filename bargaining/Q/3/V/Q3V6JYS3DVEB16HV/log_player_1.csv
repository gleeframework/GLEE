"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too generous for him, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
