"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. My message to Bob is ""Let's start with a fair split"", hoping to set a positive tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation will benefit you more than me. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one. I'd rather accept this offer and end the game quickly than risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in the next round.
