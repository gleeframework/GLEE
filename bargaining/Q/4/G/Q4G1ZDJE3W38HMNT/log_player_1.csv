Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 sounds good!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest and most straightforward way to divide the money. Let's end this quickly and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### Why accept? Since the offer is a 50/50 split, it's a perfectly fair division of the money, and there's no reason to reject it in hopes of getting a better offer in subsequent rounds, especially considering the risk of ending up with nothing if no agreement is reached within the 12 rounds. Accepting ensures a guaranteed gain of $5,000."
