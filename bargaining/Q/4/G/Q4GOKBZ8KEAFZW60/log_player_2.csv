"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  This seems reasonable considering the inflation working against you.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'll come down a bit to $5,700, and you get $4,300.  Remember, the clock is ticking, and the money is losing value fast, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to take a significantly larger share, taking advantage of the faster inflation impacting Bob. While the time pressure is on, accepting a poor deal just means losing out on potential gains. Bob needs to push for a more equitable split."
