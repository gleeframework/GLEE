"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split. I'm confident that Bob will accept it, since he doesn't know about the inflation factor.  This way, I can secure the majority of the money right from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Since I don't know how Bob is affected by inflation, there's a chance he might propose an even worse split for me in the next round.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, given the uncertainty."
