"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I know the money is worth 20% less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I don't want to give Bob such a large share, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think about the diminishing returns. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

After weighing the options, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the offer, as it seems like a decent compromise given the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
