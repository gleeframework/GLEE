"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm offering Bob a significant share of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}

This offer is a bit more aggressive, as I'm trying to get a better share of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! Considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I'll think carefully about his offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share, but the value of my share is still the same, I'll decide to...
