"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round.  I'm hoping to get most of the money and avoid any potential inflation issues!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that!  While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm hoping to get a better deal than $1. It's still early in the game, and I'm confident I can negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  We're still early in the game, and I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept before inflation kicks in further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with that offer. While the inflation is starting to impact Bob more, I'm willing to wait a few more rounds. I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, aiming to find a balance between securing a good portion of the money and avoiding further rounds where inflation might hurt me.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm determined to get a better share than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept a 20/80 split. Even with the inflation hitting Bob harder, I think I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident that my next offer will be more appealing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to raise my offer, but this time I'm only offering 70 for myself. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping to close the deal before the inflation really starts to bite."
