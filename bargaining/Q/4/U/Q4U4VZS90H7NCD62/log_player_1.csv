Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm proposing an even split.  We both get a good start, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
