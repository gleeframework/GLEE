"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division of the funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a majority share, but I'll let you keep a small amount 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $100,000 I'd get is now worth only 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about giving up a majority share, but I'd rather take $100,000 now than risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this proposal.
