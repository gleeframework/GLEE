"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$, which is a generous amount considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since Bob is now asking for a 50-50 split, it seems like he's trying to take a bit more than I initially offered.

However, considering the inflation factor, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than what I initially offered him. So, in real terms, he's actually getting 4500$ (5000 / 1.1).

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up 6000$ (my initial offer) for 4500$. It's a bit of a trade-off, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation factor. I'll offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a bit more than my initial offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not 50-50. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly better deal, but still not 50-50 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of Bob's offer, considering the inflation factor.

Bob's gain in the first round was 4000$. With 27.1% inflation, that's equivalent to 4000 / 1.271 = 3147.41$ in real terms.

So, Bob is now offering me 5200$ and taking 4800$, which is equivalent to 3147.41$ and 2871.64$ in real terms, respectively.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I was initially hoping to get at least 6000$, and now I'm being offered 5200$. However, considering the inflation factor, it's actually a better deal than my initial offer.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal for me than my initial offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
