"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering we both want to get the most out of this deal. Let's see if we can agree! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my target amount needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Considering the new proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 45% gain for myself. I'll make a new offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $480,000 and keeping $520,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
