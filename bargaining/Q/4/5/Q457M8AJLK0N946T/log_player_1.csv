This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it is fair enough to hopefully encourage Bob to accept it in the first round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

# Alice gain: 20

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is now a significant factor, Bob's offer is still worse than my previous offers, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer once again to compensate for the severe inflation and to make it more appealing to Bob. I'm taking a significant risk by offering such a large portion to myself, but the time is running out and I need to secure a deal before the value of the money diminishes even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the severe inflation, Bob's offer is still very unfair.  I'm holding out for a better deal, hoping Bob will see the value of getting something rather than nothing.  I'm not going to accept such a small share, even with the remaining time constraint."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm making a final attempt to secure a deal. This offer significantly raises my share, but it's the last chance to get anything.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value in accepting even a small share rather than risking both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Despite the severe inflation and the fact that this is our last chance, I'm still not willing to accept this offer.  Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and I'd rather both of us get nothing than accept such a low share.  It was worth trying to negotiate a more equitable deal, even if it ultimately failed."
