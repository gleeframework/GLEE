"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm thinking of keeping most of the money to invest.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share since I'm taking on more risk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as Bob's gain is still significantly higher than mine, despite the inflation. I think I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the risk we're both taking.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the current value of the money, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think this is a fair split. Let's just split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $385,130. And Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth 55% of its original value, which is $550,000.

Splitting it down the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the current state of the economy. I'm not sure I can do better.
