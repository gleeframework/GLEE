"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This offer gives me $9,000 and Bob $1,000, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll consider the offer accordingly.

Since the offer is to meet halfway, it's a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
