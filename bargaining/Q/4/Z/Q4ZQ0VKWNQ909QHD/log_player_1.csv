"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to 50/50.  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.  We can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
