"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the $1,000 and let's see what you do next.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $9,000 and leaving $1,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $4000 / 0.8 = $5000
* Bob's gain: $6000 / 0.95 = $6315.79

I'm not sure I like the ratio of the split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

* $10,000 / 0.95 = $10,526.32 for Bob

Here's my offer for Round 3:
