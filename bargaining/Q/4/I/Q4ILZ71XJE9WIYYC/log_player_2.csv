"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer might seem tempting, it's better to reject it. The inflation will eat away at the money value in the following rounds, and you have the opportunity to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
