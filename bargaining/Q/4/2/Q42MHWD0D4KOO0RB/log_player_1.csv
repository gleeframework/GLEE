"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a little greedy, Alice. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I don't think I can accept Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too greedy, Bob! I'm not giving up that much. My turn next!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, and I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. But I'm not giving up too much either!""
}
```"
