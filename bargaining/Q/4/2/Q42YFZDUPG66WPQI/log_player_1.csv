{
""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to concede a little, but inflation is making it harder for me to accept less. This offer is as fair as I can go, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now, and his offers are getting better for me. While he claims this is his ""final offer,""  I still have some leverage. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5100,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is getting out of control. I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's the best I can do. We need to reach an agreement soon or risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, Bob's offer is getting drastically worse for me due to the inflation disproportionately impacting him. He's clearly feeling the heat, and I believe I can secure a better deal in the next couple of rounds.  I need to hold my ground a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are running out of time. Inflation is making it difficult for me to accept anything less than this. It's a significant risk, but we need to reach an agreement or lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** The game has reached a critical point. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, the inflation is severely impacting him. He's clearly desperate, and his offer, while still favoring him, is the best I'm likely to get at this stage. Accepting now avoids the risk of losing everything in the remaining rounds."
