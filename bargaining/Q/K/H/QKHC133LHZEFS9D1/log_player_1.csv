"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, and gives Bob 10%. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount to keep you interested, but I'm looking for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. I gain $300,000, which is less than what I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for a 70/30 split, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split, which is a more favorable ratio for me. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still looking for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. I gain $450,000, which is more than my previous offer of $300,000, but less than my target of $600,000.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
