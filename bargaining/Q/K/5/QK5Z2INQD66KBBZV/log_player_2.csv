Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take it!  Alice's offer is better than my last one and inflation is starting to hurt."
