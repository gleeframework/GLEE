Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I need to hold out for a better offer. This deal is getting worse for me with each round."

Round 4

This is still not a good deal for me. I need to hold firm and hope Bob starts to feel the pressure."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know the inflation is killing your share, but I'm willing to take the risk to get a bigger cut. This is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept.  The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and it's unlikely Bob will offer me anything better than this. If I reject this offer, I risk walking away with even less in the following rounds."
