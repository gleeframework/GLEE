"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust later if you're not happy with that. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount, especially considering that the value of the money decreases by 5% each round for me. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I think 40% for me is a fair starting point considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. Let's try 70/30. I'm open to further negotiation, but time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think 30% is too low for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll take my chances and make another counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a new proposal for division.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please confirm that my next offer will be based on the original $10,000 amount, not the decreased value due to inflation. The inflation only affects the value of the money I gain, not the total amount being divided, correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 45% for me is a reasonable request. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable solution before the money loses more value for me.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm again, my offer is based on the original $10,000 amount, and the inflation will be applied to my gain if Alice accepts the offer, correct?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer. I'm willing to give you 35% now, but I'm not going lower. Let's agree to this before we both lose even more money! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice is not willing to give me a higher percentage, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. I'll get $3500, which is still a significant amount, and I'll avoid the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her offer. We have a deal!"
