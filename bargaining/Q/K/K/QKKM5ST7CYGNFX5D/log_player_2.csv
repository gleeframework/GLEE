**Reasoning:**

It's crunch time. Here's why I'm accepting, even though it's less than ideal:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is plummeting for me (Bob) at a much faster rate than Alice. Every round makes my potential gains significantly worse.
* **Last Chance Warning:** Alice's message implies this is her final offer. If I reject it, she's likely to offer me even less in a future round, which will be worth even less due to inflation. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While 3800 is much lower than I'd like, it's better than risking a worse offer or reaching a point where the deal is worth almost nothing due to the rapid inflation for Bob."
