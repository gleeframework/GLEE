"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, I'll give you a fair deal""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets 30%, which is $30. I'm offering Bob a ""fair deal"" because 70/30 is a relatively balanced split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 75/25, I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the new values, I'd be getting $25 (20% less than the original $30) and Bob would be getting $75 (5% less than the original $80).

I'm not thrilled about the 25/75 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a 60/40 split, it's a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still trying to get a decent deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
