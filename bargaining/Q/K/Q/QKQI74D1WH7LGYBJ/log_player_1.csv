"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, the potential for further inflation in future rounds makes it a good idea to accept.  I can't be sure how inflation affects Bob's side, so it's best to secure at least half the money."
