"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original amount, and Bob will get 20%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, now it's time for a more realistic offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64% of the original amount (80% x 0.8), and Bob's gain is worth 90% of the original amount (20% x 0.9).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still too one-sided, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of the original amount (80% x 0.64 x 0.8).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve more. Consider this a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not being too greedy, given the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it. Time to make a move. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of the original amount (80% x 0.8 x 0.64 x 0.8).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'm desperate, but I do think Bob's offer is still too one-sided. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not desperate, but I'm willing to be realistic. This is my final compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and accepting that the money is worth less and less with each passing round."
