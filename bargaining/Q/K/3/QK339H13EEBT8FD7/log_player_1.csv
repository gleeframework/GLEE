"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you can take 40. We can end the game here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of 45 is actually worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round.

However, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could potentially get a better offer in the next round. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, so my gain is worth 90% of what it would have been in the second round, which is 90% of 90% of the original amount. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 52.5 is a fair share. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway. Let's end the game here! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so my gain of 50 is actually worth 85.74% of what it would have been in the first round.

Considering that Bob is meeting me halfway, and the value of the money is decreasing, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
