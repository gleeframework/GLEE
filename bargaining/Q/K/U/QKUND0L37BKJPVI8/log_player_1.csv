"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you can take 20. Let's see if we can do better in the next round!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, since we're both taking a risk here.  Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so my gain would be 80% of 80, which is 64.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the inflation affects my end. Can we try to find a compromise?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain even more, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, my gain would be 64% of 80, which is 51.2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share. 51 for me, 49 for you. What do you think?""
}
```"
