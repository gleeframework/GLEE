"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Is this a good starting point?""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to gauge Bob's expectations and see if he'll accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low for me, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my first one, but still relatively fair. Let's see how Bob reacts!"

Round 4

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly

# Bob gain: 5000

  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, but it's a good offer""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to my target too! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite aggressive now! I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, especially since I was hoping for a bit more. I'll try to counter again:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too skewed towards you, I want a better deal""
}
```"

  ""message"": ""Let's meet somewhere in the middle again""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's fair for both of us."
