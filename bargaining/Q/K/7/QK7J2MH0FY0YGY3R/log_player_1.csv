"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm starting with a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth less, so I'm more inclined to accept a larger share. However, I still think 4000 is a bit low for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to get a better share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
