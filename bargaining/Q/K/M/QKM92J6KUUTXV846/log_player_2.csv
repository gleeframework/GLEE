"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal! Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to say that I should get a bit more since we are playing with inflation!  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, what do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more, but let's be reasonable. I'll offer you 4500,  which is still more than your original offer. Let's end this game and split the money! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation. 4500 is better than nothing! Let's end this."
