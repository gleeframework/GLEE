Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Take it before the value drops further

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical.  Another rejection helps neither of us. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous by not dropping my offer further. This is the best you'll get 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob). While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting even less in future rounds. Holding out for a 50/50 split is becoming increasingly unrealistic."
