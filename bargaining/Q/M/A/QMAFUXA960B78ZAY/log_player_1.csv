"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. The message I'll send to Bob is ""Let's split fairly."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer is not generous enough, and I'm willing to take the risk to get more. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. The message I'll send to Bob is ""Let's meet in the middle"". Since we both had a chance to make an offer, I'm trying to find a compromise, taking into account the inflation that affects both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting $400,000 now is a better option than risking further devaluation in the next rounds. Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, and I'm not confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's time to secure my gain and end the game."
