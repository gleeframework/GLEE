"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's a risky proposition to accept on the first round. Given the inflation factor, waiting even one round might lead to a better deal for me. I'm going to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option for both of us, and avoids the risk of inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is tempting, and it's clear that she's taking inflation into account. While I might be able to get a slightly higher share by rejecting and making an offer myself, there's a high risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds.  This offer provides a decent share, and I'm willing to accept it to secure something rather than risk getting nothing."
