Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you 30%, considering the inflation, it's a good deal for you.

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'll accept. Even though it's a worse deal than the 50/50 split, inflation means I'd be getting significantly less if we keep going."
