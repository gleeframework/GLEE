"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 300,000$ is now worth 90% of what it was in the previous round, so it's actually 270,000$ in real terms. 

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 420k is the minimum I'm willing to accept.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a reasonable amount, while also considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 450,000$ is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 729,000$ in real terms.

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to manipulate me with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.
