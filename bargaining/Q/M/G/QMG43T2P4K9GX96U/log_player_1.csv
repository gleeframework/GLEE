"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small share to consider while still giving me the majority. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's a better offer than the previous round, I am still not satisfied with a 2000/8000 split. I believe I deserve a larger share, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a more fair agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I propose a 5500/4500 split.  This is a more equitable distribution, giving Bob a significant share while still recognizing my contributions. I'm confident that this offer is reasonable and fair, and I hope Bob will accept it."
