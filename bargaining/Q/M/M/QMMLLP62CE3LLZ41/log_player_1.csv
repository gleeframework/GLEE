"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving away all my chips yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, Bob is offering me a slightly better share than before, and I'm willing to take it.

I'll accept the offer:
