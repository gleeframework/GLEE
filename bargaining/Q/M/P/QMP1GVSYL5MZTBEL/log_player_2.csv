Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would still mean losing out on a significant amount of money due to inflation.  It's getting riskier, but holding out a bit longer might force Alice to make a better offer."

Round 6

{

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:**  We've lost almost 26.5% of the value from Bob's perspective. Every round that passes makes the potential gains significantly smaller.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently rejected offers favoring Bob, even when they were reasonable. An even split is likely the best we can get at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out further risks Alice becoming even less willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a worse outcome or even zero gain if we run out of rounds."
