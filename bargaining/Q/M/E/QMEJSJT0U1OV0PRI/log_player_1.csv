"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll be generous!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll get 60% of the new, reduced amount. But let me calculate the actual amount I'll get:

New total: $100 * (0.9) = $90
My gain: $90 * 0.6 = $54

I'll accept Bob's offer.
