Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly now.  This is the best we can do with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains.  He's losing value rapidly with each round.
* **Fair Deal:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair. While I might have aimed for more in earlier rounds, accepting now guarantees a substantial sum without further risk.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the game risks Bob making increasingly unfavorable offers to compensate for the inflation hitting his share."
