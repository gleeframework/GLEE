"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining rounds' gains 50/50!""
}
```

This way, I get the lion's share of the initial 1,000,000$, and I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount. My message tries to entice him to accept the offer by promising a 50/50 split in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is much fairer. Let's split the money evenly before the inflation hits harder.  
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less now, my gain of $100,000 is actually $90,000 in real terms. I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a more even split than my initial offer. I'll have to consider the potential benefits of ending the game early.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You should take this while you can, Bob! The money's worth less by the minute!""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to maximize my gain while still leaving Bob with a relatively small amount. My message is trying to pressure him into accepting the offer before the next round's inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the last chance for a fair split. After this, we'll both be losing out.  
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $500,000 is actually only $727,272 in real terms. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is actually a very fair offer considering the circumstances.

I think I'll take the deal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
