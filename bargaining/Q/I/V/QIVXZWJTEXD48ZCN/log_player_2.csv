Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting impatient, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about 56-44? 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the gap is closing, Alice is still benefiting significantly more from the inflation.  It's getting riskier, but holding out a bit longer might force her to offer a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Six rounds in, the effects of inflation are really starting to bite. While ideally, I'd like a slight advantage, holding out any longer for a better deal is getting too risky. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids the risk of both of us walking away with nothing."
