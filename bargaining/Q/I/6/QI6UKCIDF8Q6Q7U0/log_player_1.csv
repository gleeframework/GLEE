Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 70,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm taking a hit with the faster inflation. This offer ensures a better deal for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is much worse for me than my previous offer was for Bob! He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I need to push for a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 65,

""message"": ""Bob, that offer wasn't reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation. This offer benefits us both.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it down the middle and call it a day. We're both losing out with every wasted round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting desperate and is finally willing to split the money evenly. However, I still have some leverage. Due to the different inflation rates, a 50/50 split now is still better for him than it would have been for me in earlier rounds.  I think I can squeeze a little more out of this.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I see you're getting serious. How about we meet in the middle? I'll take a small hit on my previous offer, you get a bit more, and we both avoid losing more to inflation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  It's more than fair considering the inflation is hitting me harder.  If you reject this, we're both going to lose out significantly. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. Bob is right, we're both losing out the longer this goes on. While his offer isn't ideal, it is better than the 50/50 split he offered before.  The difference is now quite small, and pushing it further risks getting nothing at all.
