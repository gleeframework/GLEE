"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the initial 100 dollars. This way, I'll get 60 dollars, which is 60% of the initial 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

After considering the new values due to inflation, I realize that Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept this offer.
