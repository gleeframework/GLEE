"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can conclude the game quickly. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I'm trying to be somewhat aggressive with my initial offer while still being reasonable. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a larger share than you proposed, but we need to settle this quickly before inflation eats into the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his message suggesting he's being generous, the split he's proposing is actually less favorable to me than my initial offer. Given that the money is already worth 10% less to me due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'd be getting significantly less value than I initially proposed. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway from my first offer, but we need to wrap this up soon!""}\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more conservative offer than my initial one, meeting Bob halfway from my first proposal. This is in an attempt to appear more conciliatory and willing to negotiate, while still being mindful of the fact that the money is losing value for me with each passing round. I've included a message to Bob emphasizing the need to conclude the game quickly, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept my offer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option and we're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer to split the money evenly because, at this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. With the money being worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round, holding out for a slightly better deal may not be worth the risk of further devaluation. Bob's offer is reasonable, and his message emphasizes the fairness of an even split, which is hard to argue against. Additionally, with the game's time limit and the increasing impact of inflation, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision to ensure I receive a decent share of the money."
