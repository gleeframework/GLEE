Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the smaller share now, and we'll have more to split in future rounds! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept that offer. Bob is trying to take advantage of me, thinking I'll be desperate. I'll stick to my strategy of trying to get as much as possible, even if it means we risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, and we'll both get a fair share 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's getting risky. Bob seems to be getting more aggressive with inflation, and I don't know how much longer I can hold out. 500,000 is a decent amount, and it's better than getting nothing."
