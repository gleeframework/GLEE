"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem risky given the inflation rates, but consider it an opportunity for long-term gain. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though the money will be worth less in future rounds, a 75/25 split is a good starting point.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
