"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get a decent amount.  Accept this and we're both happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's important to remember the inflation.  We have 12 rounds, and with each round, the value of money decreases.  By rejecting, I can at least try to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it closer to the middle. This gives us both a good starting point.""}
