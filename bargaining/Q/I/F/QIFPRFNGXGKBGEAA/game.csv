400000.0,600000.0,"I understand the inflation pressure, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable; this offer is more reflective of a fair split considering the remaining rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation is affecting your gain, I've adjusted my offer slightly. This is still a good deal for you, and we should settle before the inflation worsens.",Alice,3,

540000.0,460000.0,"Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to. Given the massive hit inflation is taking on your share, I'm making a minimal adjustment. This is likely as good as it gets for you.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split.  I'm willing to accept the significant loss imposed by inflation to end this pointless back-and-forth. Accept this offer and we both walk away with something. Reject it, and we both risk getting nothing.",Bob,8,
