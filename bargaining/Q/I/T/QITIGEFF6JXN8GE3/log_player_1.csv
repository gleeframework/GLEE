Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a generous offer!  I'm hoping to get most of the money, but I want to avoid risking everything by being too greedy in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm not going to accept being given only 10% of the money. I'll see what Bob is willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try to increase my share again. Bob rejected my last offer, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to compromise a little bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still not willing to accept such an unequal split. I'll see what Bob is willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try another compromise, but I'm starting to feel the pressure from the inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see that we're both losing money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept such a low share. It's clear that Bob is being stubborn, but I'm hoping he'll come around to a more reasonable offer soon. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm not going to give in just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm starting to get worried about inflation. I need to make a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a better share than Bob's offers. This should be enough to tempt him while still giving me a decent portion."
