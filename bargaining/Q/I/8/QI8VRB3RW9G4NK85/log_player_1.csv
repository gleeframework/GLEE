"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 3:2 split, considering the decreasing value of money over time. This way, we both get a decent share and avoid risking more in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
