"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I get 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm not going to accept it on the first round. There's a lot of time left in the game, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm confident I can get more than 10% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than your previous offer. Let's split the money fairly - I'll take 55%, you take 45%.  This way, we both get a good share of the pie. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share. This time, I'm offering you more than your previous offer, so let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is significantly better than my previous proposal. With inflation already starting to impact the value of the money, it's important to secure a deal now.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a decent amount of money and avoid the risk of getting nothing if the game continues."
