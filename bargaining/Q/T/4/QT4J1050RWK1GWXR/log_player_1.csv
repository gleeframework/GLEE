"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a fair and straightforward offer, suggesting a 50/50 split. It's a simple and reasonable proposal that should be hard for Bob to refuse!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, that's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'm not thrilled about accepting only 400,000, but it's a decent starting point. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 400,000 for me, I'll try to counteroffer with a higher amount, considering the inflation factor. I'll offer 420,000 to Bob, which is a 5% increase from his previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between 400k and 500k, let's settle on 420k for you""
}
```"
