I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty generous offer, but I want to secure a large portion of the money before inflation takes its toll. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not going to let him. This offer is too unfavorable to me, especially considering the devaluation of the money. I'll reject this and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor this time.  While the money is worth less now, I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share to avoid further rounds and the risk of even lower offers."
