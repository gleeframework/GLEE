"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share, but you still get something.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to take something, especially with the threat of inflation, it's better to see if Alice is willing to be more fair.  I can try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. This is a fair deal for both of us.""}
