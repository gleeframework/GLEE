"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving you 900,000 and Bob 100,000. This seems fair to me, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I'm losing more money due to inflation, I'm still losing 80% of the total, while Bob is only losing 20%. This is very unfair and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving you 700,000 and Bob 300,000. While Bob made a very unreasonable offer, I am willing to compromise to avoid further losses due to inflation."
