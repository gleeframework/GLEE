"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 49 is worth 5% less than the 60 I proposed in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
