I propose a division of 90 dollars for myself and 10 dollars for Bob."

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 
 
I propose a division of 80 dollars for myself and 20 dollars for Bob. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time to incentivize acceptance, but I still need to secure a majority of the funds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I propose a division of 70 dollars for myself and 30 dollars for Bob.  While inflation is eating away at the value of the money, I still need to secure a decent share. I believe this offer is fair and will be more appealing to Bob than his previous proposals."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a division of 60 dollars for myself and 40 dollars for Bob.  Time is running out and inflation is hitting hard. This offer is still a majority for me, but it's a significant concession to hopefully encourage Bob to accept before it's too late for both of us."
