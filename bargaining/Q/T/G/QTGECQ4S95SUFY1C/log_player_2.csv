**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that inflation is impacting my potential gains, her offer is getting progressively worse. It's time to show I'm serious about getting a more equitable split, even if it means risking a lower payout as time goes on."

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 460000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a tipping point.  While Alice's offer isn't ideal, the impact of inflation is becoming too severe. Accepting this offer yields a significantly higher return than holding out and risking even worse offers in later rounds, potentially ending up with nothing."
