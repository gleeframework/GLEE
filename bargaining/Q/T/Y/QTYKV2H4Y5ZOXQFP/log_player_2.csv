"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept an even split, but we have 12 rounds to work with. I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal, especially since inflation might be impacting Alice's side of things differently."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a slightly uneven split, with 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  This gives me a bit more, but also leaves you with a decent share.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
