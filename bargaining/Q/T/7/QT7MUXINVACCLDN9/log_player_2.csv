Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, time is ticking and that money is shrinking. I'm proposing $5600 for me and $4400 for you. It's a strong offer considering the inflation, and it lets us both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
