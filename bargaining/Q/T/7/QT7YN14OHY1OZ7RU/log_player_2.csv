"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to take a smaller cut this round, but I'm still the one making the offer.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation disparity benefits her.  It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a fair split considering the inflation rate is working against me.  If you reject this, I'm not going lower."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round that passes erodes the value of the money, especially for Bob.  He needs to apply pressure for a decision.
* **Strong Stance:**  By stating this is his final offer, Bob creates a sense of urgency and signals that he's serious about his valuation.
* **Slight Compromise:** Bob is willing to take a slightly smaller share than his previous offer (650,000) to entice Alice to accept and end the negotiation.

This offer is a calculated risk. If Alice is reasonable and understands the impact of inflation, she's likely to accept. If she's holding out for a significantly larger share, Bob may have to accept a less favorable deal in a later round."
