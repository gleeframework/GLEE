"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 7-3, a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting Bob's offer. I'll have to consider this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 7-3 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 55-45, a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now. Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can accept a 50-50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $5,000 and call it a day. It's a fair split, and I'm not willing to risk waiting for a better offer with the inflation eating away at the money."
