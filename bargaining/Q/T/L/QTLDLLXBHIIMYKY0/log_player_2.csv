Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a more favorable division."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not convinced by Alice's message that this is her final offer, and considering the inflation impact, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more balanced division. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to either receive a better offer or make one that Alice finds acceptable."
