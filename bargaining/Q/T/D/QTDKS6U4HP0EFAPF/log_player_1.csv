I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. This is a generous offer given the limited rounds and the fact that the money loses value with each passing round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

With the value of the money dropping so quickly, I need to start securing a reasonable amount for myself.  This offer maintains a significant gain for Bob while offering me a 80/20 split, demonstrating a commitment to finding a solution."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

Bob's offer:

This is a significant reduction in my potential earnings, but with only a few rounds left, it's the most reasonable option.  The value of the money is quickly decreasing, and I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
