Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share Alice, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. This offer is fair considering the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is a fair deal, and we both lose if we don't agree soon. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I receive something substantial before inflation erodes the value further.  The difference between our positions is narrowing, and Bob is feeling the pressure of the declining value more acutely. Delaying further carries a significant risk of getting even less."
