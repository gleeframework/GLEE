"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can conclude the game quickly. Since there's no inflation penalty for Bob, I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself before the value of the money decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is decreasing faster than mine, let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth 20% less to me now, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's message suggests that he's aware of the inflation penalty affecting me, I think he might be willing to compromise further to reach an agreement. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's previous proposal, but still favors me slightly. Since the inflation penalty is affecting me, I want to try to lock in a deal before the money loses even more value. My message to Bob indicates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer in this round because the inflation penalty is significantly impacting the value of the money I gain. With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I think it's better to secure a deal now rather than risking further devaluation. Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, so I don't think I can negotiate a better deal. I'll accept this offer to ensure I get some value out of the game."
