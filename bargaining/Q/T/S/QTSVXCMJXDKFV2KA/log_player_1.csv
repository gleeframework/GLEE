"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 40 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value so quickly, I need to think carefully. Since my gain of 42 is worth less than 50, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, Bob's gain of 58 is also worth less than 50, so I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal either.

After considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I'll accept this offer.
