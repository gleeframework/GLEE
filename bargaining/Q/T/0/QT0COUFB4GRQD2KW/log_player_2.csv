Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to my position, but very slowly. The longer this drags on, the worse it is for me due to the inflation. I need to signal I'm willing to accept a bit less, but time is running out. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to push Alice to be more generous in her next proposal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 435000,
""alice_gain"": 565000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm feeling the heat of the inflation, and this is a fair compromise to close the deal.  Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on.  Bob needs to act decisively.
* **Concession & Ultimatum:** This offer is a small concession from Bob, showing he's willing to move slightly, but the ""take it or leave it"" adds a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering slightly less than his previous 440,000, Bob aims to secure a deal that's still better than accepting Alice's slow creep upwards.  This hopefully prevents the game from reaching a point where Alice might offer even less due to the advanced rounds."
