Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is very unfavorable, accepting it guarantees at least some money. Rejecting it risks getting nothing in the next round due to the accelerating inflation."
