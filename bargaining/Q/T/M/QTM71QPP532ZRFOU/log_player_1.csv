"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and leaves Bob with $100,000. The message is a friendly way of saying that I'm making a strong opening offer, but I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started strong, but I'm aiming for a better split! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the adjusted amounts:

My gain: $400,000 / 0.95 = $421,053
Bob's gain: $600,000 / 0.9 = $666,667

Considering the adjusted amounts, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

This offer takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to find a more balanced split."
