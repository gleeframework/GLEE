"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer this round.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  Alice's share loses value faster than Bob's. By round 2, her $6000 offer is less appealing. 
* **Strong Stance:** Offering slightly more than half shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal but is willing to negotiate.
* **Finality:** Adding ""final offer"" creates urgency, increasing the chance Alice accepts now rather than risking further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting $4200 is better than risking further devaluation in future rounds.  
* **Alice's Position Weakens:** Alice's offer is only slightly better for her than before, suggesting she feels the pressure of inflation too.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a significantly better offer in later rounds is too risky given the rapid depreciation."
