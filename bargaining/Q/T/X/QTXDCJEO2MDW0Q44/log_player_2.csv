While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting longer means a smaller gain even if I manage to secure a slightly better deal.
* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point. The risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly with each rejected offer. 
* **Fairness:** Alice's offer, while not ideal, is at least fair in its current form. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed, albeit smaller, sum than to risk losing everything by continuing to play hardball."
