This is getting dangerous, but I still have a little leverage. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but she needs me to agree."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{

""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. I'll take a little less, but this is as low as I'm going.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a concession to avoid disaster. While a 50/50 split was ideal, it's clear Alice is willing to play hardball. Offering 4800 signals I'm willing to negotiate but sets a firm floor to avoid getting completely fleeced as inflation eats into my potential gains."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on.  Alice is clearly exploiting the situation, and this offer is terrible compared to earlier rounds. However, rejecting this means risking getting even less in subsequent rounds as inflation keeps chipping away at my potential gains. Accepting now cuts my losses and at least secures something."
