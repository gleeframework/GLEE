"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, $500,000 is equivalent to $454,545.45 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I could have gotten $600,000 in the first round. But it's a 50/50 split now, which is a decent compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less from the first round, and another 10% less from the second round), I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take $550,000. It's a slightly better deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now (10% less from the first round, another 10% from the second round, and 7.1% from the third round), $450,000 is equivalent to $333,333.33 in the first round's value.

Considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for me, I think I should be more willing to accept a deal. However, I still have to consider the fact that I was offered $550,000 in the previous round, which is a better deal for me.
