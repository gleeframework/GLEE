  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm taking a bit more than before, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Maybe he'll finally accept!"

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

Round 12
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","That's an insult! Bob is basically offering me a tiny fraction of the total amount. I'll reject this ridiculous offer.

}
```

It looks like we've reached the end of the 12 rounds, and neither of us has accepted the other's offer. Unfortunately, that means we'll both leave with $0. Better luck next time!"
