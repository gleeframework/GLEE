# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need more than the last offer.   
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

The money is decreasing in value rapidly, and Alice's offer, while not ideal, is the best chance to get a decent share before the value drops even further."
