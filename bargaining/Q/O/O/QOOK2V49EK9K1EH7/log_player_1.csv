Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. I'm not going to give you 40, but I'll give you 20, it's the least I can do! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting.  Although my share is much less than what I was hoping for,  it's still something and inflation will only get worse.  I'll need to be strategic to get a better deal in the future."
