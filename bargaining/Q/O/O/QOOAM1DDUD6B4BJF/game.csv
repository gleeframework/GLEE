900000.0,100000.0,I propose a 90/10 split. This seems fair considering the next rounds will be less profitable for both of us. Let's end this quickly!,Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"You rejected my 90/10 offer, so I'll offer a 70/30 split. You're getting a better deal this time!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Since we're both losing value with each round, let's split it evenly. This way we both get something substantial, even with the inflation.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"You suggested an even split, but I think I can do better. I'll offer a 55/45 split. You'll get a bit more than before, but I'll still come out on top.",Bob,4,
