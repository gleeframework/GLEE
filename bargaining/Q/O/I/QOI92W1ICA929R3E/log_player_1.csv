"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. Let's see if we can do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiating and adjusting the split in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll let you keep a small share. Next round, I'll try to do better for you! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to be careful with my decision. Since Bob is taking the majority, I'll have to think about whether it's worth continuing to negotiate.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's getting tough with inflation, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 50-50 for now, but I'm still hoping to do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to at least maintain some value in the face of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize. Let's see if you'll accept this time! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significantly reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth continuing to negotiate. With the money I'd gain being worth only 14.26% of its original value, I'm not thrilled about the prospect of accepting a 10$ consolation prize.

However, I don't want to give up entirely. I'll try to make a stronger case for myself in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting hard now! With the money I'd gain being worth only 85.74% of its original value (100% - 14.26%), I'll have to be extremely cautious with my proposal.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I'll give you a significant majority, but I'm hoping you'll show some mercy and give me a decent share. This is my last offer!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, hoping to salvage what's left of the original value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm not sure I'll have much to negotiate with in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of options, Alice. I'll take most of the remaining money, but I'll let you keep a tiny fraction. Don't expect mercy! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is relentless! With the money I'd gain being worth only 77.38% of its original value (100% - 14.26% - 14.26% - 14.26% - 22.62%), I'm almost at the breaking point.

Considering the tiny fraction I'd gain, I'm not sure it's worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm not ready to give up yet.

I'll reject this offer and try to make one final push for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's getting dire. With the money I'd gain being worth only 77.38% of its original value, I'll have to make a very aggressive proposal to try and salvage what's left.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 100,
  ""message"": ""I'm out of options, Bob. I'll give you the entire $100 if you'll just agree to it. I'm not sure I can do any better.""
}
```

I'm essentially surrendering, hoping that Bob will take pity on me and accept the offer. If he rejects this, I'm not sure I'll have any bargaining power left."
