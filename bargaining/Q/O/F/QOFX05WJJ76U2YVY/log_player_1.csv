"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split. I'm hoping that Bob will accept it, as I believe he's likely to be motivated by getting any money at all, even a small amount.  We'll see how he feels about it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, this offer is fair and in my best interest. There's a good chance that if I reject this, the offers will only get worse for me as the rounds continue and inflation erodes the value of my share."
