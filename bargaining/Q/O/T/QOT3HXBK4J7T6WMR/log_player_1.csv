"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, given that I'm taking the first move.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'll take my chances with the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to increase my share a bit, but still offer Bob a decent cut.  I think this is a fair compromise after his aggressive first offer.  Hopefully, he'll see it that way!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting even more greedy! I'm not going to be bullied into accepting such a low offer. I'll stick to my guns and see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a compromise. I'll go back to my original offer from round 2. Bob's been acting like a stubborn child, so hopefully this will show him I'm willing to be reasonable while still asserting my value in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  Bob is clearly not going to budge from his 50/50 split, and the inflation is getting out of control. At this point, getting half the money is better than risking getting nothing at all!"
