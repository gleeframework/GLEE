"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I'm betting that Bob will want to avoid too much risk of inflation and will accept a smaller share rather than risk losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair offer and accepting it guarantees me half the money.  With the inflation, the risk of rejecting and getting less is too high."
