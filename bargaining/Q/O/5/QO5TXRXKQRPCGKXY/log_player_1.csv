"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept the offer as a fair division. This initial offer is a starting point for negotiations, taking into account that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. By starting with a slightly higher share for myself, I aim to create room for compromise in subsequent rounds if Bob decides to reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the value of the money will decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because accepting a 45-55 split in his favor after the first round does not take into account the strategic advantage I have due to the differing inflation rates affecting our shares. The fact that the money's value decreases more for Bob than for me with each round gives me leverage to negotiate for a better share. Additionally, accepting this offer early on may not maximize my potential gain, considering we have multiple rounds to negotiate and the pressure of decreasing value may prompt Bob to offer more favorable terms in subsequent rounds to secure an agreement before the value drops further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\nIn this round, I increase my share to 58% and decrease Bob's share to 42%, emphasizing the impact of inflation on our potential gains. Given that the value of the money decreases more significantly for Bob, I aim to use this to my advantage by making an offer that still seems generous considering the circumstances but secures a larger portion for myself. The message is designed to remind Bob of the consequences of delaying an agreement and to frame my offer as a reasonable compromise given the conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I think a 58/42 split is fair given the current inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I reject Bob's offer because, despite his suggestion to meet in the middle, the proposed 42-58 split in his favor does not adequately reflect the increasing pressure of inflation on his potential gain. Given that the money's value has decreased more significantly for Bob (27.1%) than for me (14.26%) since the first round, I believe I have the leverage to negotiate for a better share. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not fully utilizing the strategic advantage provided by the differing inflation rates. I aim to push for a more favorable division in subsequent rounds, anticipating that the mounting pressure of decreasing value will make Bob more inclined to agree to terms that are more advantageous to me.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, be wise""}\n\nIn this round, I decide to increase my share to 60% and decrease Bob's share to 40%, emphasizing the growing impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains. The significantly higher decrease in value for Bob (27.1% compared to my 14.26%) puts pressure on him to secure an agreement sooner rather than later. My message is a reminder of this strategic disadvantage, urging him to be wise and accept the offer before the value of his share drops even further. By framing the offer in this context, I aim to present it as a reasonable and prudent choice for Bob, despite the split being in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both feeling the effects of inflation, so let's split the difference and go for a 60/40 split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I reject Bob's offer because, despite his acknowledgment of the inflation's effects on both of us, the proposed 40-60 split in his favor still doesn't adequately reflect the significantly greater impact of inflation on his potential gain. The value of the money has decreased by 40.95% for Bob, compared to 22.62% for me, since the first round. This substantial difference in the devaluation of our shares means I have a considerable advantage in negotiations. Accepting this offer would not maximize my potential gain, given the increasing pressure on Bob to secure an agreement as the value of his share continues to drop more sharply. I aim to negotiate for a more favorable division, leveraging the greater impact of inflation on Bob's share to secure a better deal.\n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 620000, ""bob_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Inflation's hitting you hard, don't wait""}\n\nIn this round, I increase my share to 62% and decrease Bob's share to 38%, emphasizing the mounting pressure of inflation on Bob's potential gains. With the value of the money decreasing by 40.95% for Bob compared to 22.62% for me, I believe I have a strong negotiating position. By pointing out the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share and urging him not to wait, I aim to create a sense of urgency and present my offer as a reasonable and timely choice for both parties. The message is designed to remind Bob of the strategic disadvantage he faces due to the differing inflation rates and to encourage him to accept the offer before the value of his share drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a 62/38 split now, as the inflation is impacting me significantly. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to accept a 62-38 split, the proposed division is in his favor, not mine. Given the significantly greater impact of inflation on Bob's share (52.17% decrease in value compared to 30.17% for me), I believe I have the leverage to negotiate for a better share. The fact that Bob is now open to the 62-38 split suggests he is feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, but proposing it in his favor indicates he may still be trying to maximize his gain without fully acknowledging the strategic disadvantage he faces. I aim to continue negotiating for a more favorable division, emphasizing the greater impact of inflation on Bob's share to secure a better deal."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Inflation's severely impacting your share, reconsider""}\n\nIn this round, I decide to increase my share to 65% and decrease Bob's share to 35%, highlighting the severe impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains. With the value of the money decreasing by 52.17% for Bob compared to 30.17% for me, I believe I have a significant negotiating advantage. By emphasizing the disproportionate effect of inflation on Bob's share and urging him to reconsider, I aim to create a strong sense of urgency and present my offer as a reasonable choice given the circumstances. The message is designed to remind Bob of the substantial strategic disadvantage he faces due to the differing inflation rates and to encourage him to accept the offer before the value of his share drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting pretty risky for both of us now. I think we should split the difference and accept a 65/35 split. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his acknowledgment of the increasing risk and suggestion to split the difference, the proposed 35-65 split is in his favor, not mine. Given the significantly greater impact of inflation on Bob's share (61.26% decrease in value compared to 36.98% for me), I believe I have the leverage to negotiate for a better share. The fact that Bob is now open to the 65-35 split but proposes it in his favor indicates he may still be trying to maximize his gain without fully acknowledging the strategic disadvantage he faces. I aim to continue negotiating for a more favorable division, emphasizing the greater impact of inflation on Bob's share to secure a better deal. With only a couple of rounds left, I am aware of the risk of not reaching an agreement, but I believe the pressure of the situation may prompt Bob to offer more favorable terms in the next round to avoid losing everything."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 680000, ""bob_gain"": 320000, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's too late""}\n\nIn this round, I increase my share to 68% and decrease Bob's share to 32%, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. With only one round left after this, the pressure is high for both of us to reach an agreement. Given the significantly greater impact of inflation on Bob's share (61.26% decrease in value compared to 36.98% for me), I believe I have a strong negotiating position. By framing this offer as the last chance before it's too late, I aim to create a sense of finality and encourage Bob to accept the offer rather than risk losing everything in the next round. The message is designed to remind Bob of the severe consequences of not reaching an agreement and to present my offer as the most reasonable choice given the circumstances."
