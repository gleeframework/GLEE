"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can adjust as needed later.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share since I'm making the first offer. Let's see how it goes! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."
