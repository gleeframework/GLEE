"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This is a fair split considering the potential for inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 7:3 is a more reasonable split, considering the risk of inflation. Let's give me a bit more to account for potential losses. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
