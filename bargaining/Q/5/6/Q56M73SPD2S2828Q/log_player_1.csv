"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm aiming to get the most money possible.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it. However, I'm not being greedy, as the next round, he'll be in a stronger position due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better for me to accept this offer. While I'm getting less than my initial offer, the inflation means that if I reject, I'll be offered even less in the next round.  It's better to take what I can get now."
