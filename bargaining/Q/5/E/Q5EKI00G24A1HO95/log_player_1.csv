"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite reasonable, Alice, and I appreciate the sentiment of a near-even split.  However, since I'm now taking on the risk, I propose we simply reverse the amounts for this round. This still ensures a near 50/50 split while accounting for the shift in bargaining power. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
