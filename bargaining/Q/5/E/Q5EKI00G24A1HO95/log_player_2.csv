"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to 50/50, but slightly in my favor to make it worth the risk for me starting the negotiation. This way we both benefit from starting with a fair deal and avoiding inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Your offer was quite reasonable, Alice, and I appreciate the sentiment of a near-even split.  However, since I'm now taking on the risk, I propose we simply reverse the amounts for this round. This still ensures a near 50/50 split while accounting for the shift in bargaining power.""
