"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This way we both benefit from finishing the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a one-time deal, and I'm aiming for a larger share. Take this opportunity before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn to be realistic. Inflation hurts us both, but it hits me harder. This offer ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I proposed a higher share in the previous round, Alice's offer is now reasonable considering the rapid inflation. Accepting ensures I get something substantial, whereas rejecting risks getting even less in future rounds.
