"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share this time, Bob. Consider it a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try and get a better deal. The current offer doesn't seem very fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 seems like a good compromise considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and tried to find a middle ground that would be acceptable for both of us. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in accepting this offer."
