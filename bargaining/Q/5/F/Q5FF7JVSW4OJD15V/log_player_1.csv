"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a compromise. I'll accept this offer.
