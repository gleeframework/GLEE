Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. This offer is a compromise, keeping in mind the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are reflecting that. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer we wait, the more the inflation hurts her. I'm willing to gamble on another round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  Let's close this out and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly from Round 2. This puts more pressure on Alice who is experiencing significantly higher inflation.  While it's a riskier move, her increasingly desperate offers suggest she might be willing to accept a less favorable deal soon to avoid walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. This is a simple, fair 50/50 split.  Take it while it's still on the table. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I was hoping to secure a slightly larger share, Alice offering a 50/50 split is a significant shift in her position. It's clear the increasing inflation is putting immense pressure on her. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial sum, whereas continuing the game carries the risk of her becoming even more desperate and offering significantly less favorable terms, or even reaching a point where no deal is possible."
