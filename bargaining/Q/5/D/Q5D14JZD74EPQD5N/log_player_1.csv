"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. My gain of 2000 is worth 5% less than the 4000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 3800 in the first round. This is a relatively small share, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, considering the effects of inflation. My gain of 5500 is worth 5% less than the 6000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 5850 in the first round. I hope Bob will find this offer more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not sure it's fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really adding up!

Considering the offer, my gain of 3000 is worth 14.26% less than the 4000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 3448 in the first round. That's a relatively small share, but I'll think about it.

I'll reject the offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""50-50, a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable compromise, considering the effects of inflation. My gain of 5000 is worth 12.5% less than the 6000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to 5250 in the first round. I hope Bob will accept this offer."
