"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the majority, but I'll consider the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I feel like I'm getting a relatively small share, and I'm not sure I'm willing to settle for that. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and still leaving room for Bob to get a decent share as well."
