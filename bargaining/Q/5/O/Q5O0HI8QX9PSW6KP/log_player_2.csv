Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a fairer ratio than 3:1. Will you take it?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a more balanced division of 45$ for me and 55$ for you. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
