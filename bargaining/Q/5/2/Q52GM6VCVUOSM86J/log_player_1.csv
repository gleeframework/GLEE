"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
 I propose that Alice receives $999,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This ensures a large share for me, while still giving Bob a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Bob's offer gives me a substantial amount, and any further rounds risk losing even more money to inflation."
