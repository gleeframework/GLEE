"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is making the offer, I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52-48 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation risk.""}

I'm trying to squeeze in a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
