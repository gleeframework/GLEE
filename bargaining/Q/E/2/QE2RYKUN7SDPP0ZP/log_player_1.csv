"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can avoid any potential disagreements. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really getting a good deal here! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to lowball me or if he's genuinely confident in his proposal. Either way, I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal than you think, don't overplay your hand""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this offer or try to squeeze even more out of me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. My gains are worth significantly less due to inflation, and Bob's offer seems to be a slight improvement over my previous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to compromise enough, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, I'm taking control""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this offer or try to push back!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in, I'm taking control now 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to flip the script! With the money being worth significantly less, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it. It seems like Bob is trying to assert his dominance, and I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal possible. However, with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on any money at all."
