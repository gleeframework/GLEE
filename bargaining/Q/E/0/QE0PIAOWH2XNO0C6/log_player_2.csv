"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob!  We have time to negotiate a much better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

This offer is aggressive, but establishes a strong starting point for Bob.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Alice's money is devaluing faster than Bob's.  Each round she delays, the deal gets worse for her in relative terms.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number for himself, Bob sets a reference point. Even if Alice negotiates him down, it's less likely to reach a truly unfair split.
* **Bluffing:** The ""take it or leave it"" approach might intimidate Alice, especially since she started with a very generous offer.

It's a gamble, but given the time pressure and potential gains, it's a risk worth taking in Round 2."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable split, but we're not there yet.  Here's why we should reject:

* **Negotiating Power:** Alice is clearly feeling the time pressure, moving significantly from her 90/10 offer. This indicates Bob has room to push for more.
* **Inflation Advantage:** Every round that passes favors Bob. While a 60/40 split might seem tempting, waiting her out could lead to an even better deal.
* **Target Range:** Bob's initial 70/30 was ambitious. It's likely the final deal will fall somewhere between that and Alice's current offer. Holding out keeps that possibility alive. 

Let's see how much further we can push Alice!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking.  I'm willing to settle for 65/35.  Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but not by much. A 15% reduction from his initial offer might seem significant, but it's still a strong position.
* **Time Pressure Emphasis:**  By highlighting the dwindling time, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice.  The message subtly implies she stands to lose more than he does by delaying.
* **Positioning for Compromise:** This offer sets the stage for a potential compromise in the next round or two. If Alice counters, it's likely to be within a range Bob finds acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every round. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While Bob could hold out for a slightly better deal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob's money is devaluing slower, continuing to reject offers carries the risk of getting nothing if they don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds.  
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. Getting greedy could backfire if Alice decides to hold out for a better deal in later rounds.
* **Time Value:** Even with inflation, securing 500,000 now is better than potentially getting a slightly higher amount much later (and risking getting nothing at all).

This is a good deal considering the circumstances, and it's wiser to take the guaranteed win than risk losing everything."
