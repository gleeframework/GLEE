Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise.  I'll come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe a slightly larger share for me is fair given the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me much faster than her. Accepting now would lock me into a significantly worse deal as the game progresses. I'm willing to gamble on getting a better offer in a later round."
