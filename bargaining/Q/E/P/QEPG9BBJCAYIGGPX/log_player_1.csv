"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as I'm trying to be fair and reasonable in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping most of the money 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think it's still very biased towards Bob, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a fairer split. I'm willing to accept less than 50%, but 60/40 is still too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'd like to propose an alternative in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being reasonable and pushing for a better deal. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced, but I'll give you a slightly better offer. This is my last chance to compromise 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, and I think I can do better than this. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm starting to get a bit concerned that Bob is trying to lowball me, and I don't want to settle for an offer that's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'll try to come up with an even more aggressive offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting intense! Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. This is my final offer, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still being reasonable. I'm not sure if Bob will accept, but I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
