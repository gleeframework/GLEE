"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively generous offer, so I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This offer gives us both a decent share. Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be fair, huh? That's a good start!

However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60-40 split. I'd like to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a 55-45 split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced, but still a fair deal. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
