550000.0,450000.0,Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that benefits both of us. I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think this split is more reflective of the fact that the money loses value for you faster than it does for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split the money equally. We've both lost some value due to inflation, so I think this is a fair compromise.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, I understand you want an even split, but the declining value makes that tricky. I'm proposing a split that reflects the reality of our situation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Considering the increasing loss of value, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the higher depreciation on my end. This is still a relatively fair split.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
380000.0,620000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each round. This offer secures a good portion for you considering the devaluation, and allows us to both walk away with something substantial.",Bob,6,

540000.0,460000.0,"Given the significant loss of value on my end, I'm adjusting my offer to ensure I don't end up with less than what's fair. This split still gives Bob a substantial amount considering the lower depreciation on his end.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I'm aiming for a win-win here, but we need to be realistic. This offer gives you a decent share considering how much value is eroding with each passing moment.  Let's close this deal and avoid going empty-handed.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"We're running out of time, and the value is decreasing rapidly for me. Given the circumstances, I believe this split is necessary to compensate for the significant loss I'm facing. It still offers Bob a considerable amount.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, this is it. We're at the brink. This offer ensures you get something substantial before the value completely evaporates. Don't let pride leave us both with nothing.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"We're at the edge, and I'm facing a huge loss in value. This split reflects the reality of our situation, where I need to compensate for the massive depreciation. It's still a significant amount for Bob, considering the circumstances.",Alice,11,
