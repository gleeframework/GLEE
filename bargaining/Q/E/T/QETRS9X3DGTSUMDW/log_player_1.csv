"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's reverse the roles this time, I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good deal for me!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counter-proposal!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time!"
