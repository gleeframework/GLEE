"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount to end the game immediately, or if he's going to gamble on getting a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, and while I'm taking a hit due to inflation, it's still a significant amount of money.  Accepting this deal is the most sensible choice."
