Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, consider the inflation on your side 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise.  I'll take slightly less than an even split to avoid further inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I'll take a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept the offer, as the inflation is severely impacting the value of my share.  Even though it's less than I'd hoped, it's more than I'll get if I continue to reject and the inflation keeps rising."
