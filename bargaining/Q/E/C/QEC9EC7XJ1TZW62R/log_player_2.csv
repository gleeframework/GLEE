{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, that was a pretty lopsided offer. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  Take it or leave it, the value for both of us decreases with each round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I understand you want a bigger share. This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you more, but I also need to make sure I get a fair cut.  Let's end this before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
