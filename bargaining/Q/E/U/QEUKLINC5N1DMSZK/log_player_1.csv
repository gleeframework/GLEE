"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking the larger share. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a pretty bad deal for me.  It's better to reject and see what happens in the next round.  My money isn't losing value yet, so I have the advantage right now.  Let's see what Bob offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy. I'm still holding the advantage because my money isn't losing value yet. I'm going to offer a slightly less favorable split for Bob, but hopefully, it's enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not great, and I'm still holding the advantage in this round because my money hasn't lost any value yet. I'm going to reject and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to keep reducing my offer slightly, hoping that Bob will start to feel the pressure of the increasing inflation.  He's losing a lot of value on his side of the deal, so he might be more inclined to accept something closer to my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get a good deal, but his money is losing value so quickly. I'm going to reject again and see if he's finally willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to keep decreasing my offer slightly, but this time I'm going to be a little more cautious. I'm not sure how much longer Bob will be willing to hold out, but I'm hoping that the combination of my decreasing offer and the increasing inflation will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to being fair, but I'm still in a strong position.  I'm going to hold out for another round and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is getting a little risky, but with the inflation hitting Bob hard, it's time to try for an even split.  If he rejects, I'll be in a tougher spot next round."
