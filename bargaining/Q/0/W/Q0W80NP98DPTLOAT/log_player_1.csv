I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. I want to maximize my gains while keeping Bob just barely incentivized to accept.  The inflation factor could be high, so I want to secure as much as possible early on.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is absolutely ridiculous!  He's trying to take almost everything, even with the inflation factor.  I'm not going to let him get away with that.  I'll counter with a much fairer proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a more balanced offer this time.  I'm still wary of the inflation, but I need to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate fairly. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable starting point, especially since Bob is already getting the advantage from the inflation. Hopefully, this will lead to a more productive negotiation."
