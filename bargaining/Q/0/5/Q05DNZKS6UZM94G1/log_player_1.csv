Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that Alice gets $990,000 and Bob gets $10,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the time constraints of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
