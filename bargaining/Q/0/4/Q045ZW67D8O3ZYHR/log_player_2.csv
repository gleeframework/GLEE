Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll take a smaller share this time to get the deal done. But I'm not going lower than 5500.  It's getting risky waiting longer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob due to the rapidly increasing inflation. 

**Here's why:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  Bob is losing value with each round at a rate of 5%. Accepting $4500 now is significantly better than risking getting a slightly better deal later when the money is worth even less.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is also experiencing inflation, but at a much higher rate (20%). This means she's highly motivated to close the deal sooner rather than later. Waiting for her to potentially offer a slightly better deal in Round 4 is very risky, as her offer might be much lower due to the decreased value of the money for her. 

**In essence, taking the $4500 now is a safer bet than gambling on a potentially worse outcome in future rounds.**"
