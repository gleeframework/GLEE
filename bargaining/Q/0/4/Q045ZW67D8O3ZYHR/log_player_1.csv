Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a very uneven split, Alice. How about we go with 60/40?  It accounts for the time-value of the money, giving you a better deal than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
