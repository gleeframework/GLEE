Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, but giving myself a larger share to account for the inflation that affects Bob more heavily.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is making it increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob's offer is fair, and accepting it will ensure we both get a decent amount of money."
