"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $800,000 and Bob getting $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  No need for any more rounds! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $400,000 in terms of purchasing power.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
