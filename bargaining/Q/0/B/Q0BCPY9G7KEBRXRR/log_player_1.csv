Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very greedy proposal! I'll take $99 and give Bob just $1.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to try to get as much as I can in the first round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to keep the $99, it's clear Bob is not afraid to play hardball. Since I don't know how inflation affects him, it's risky to keep rejecting offers.  A 50/50 split is a fair deal considering the uncertainty, so I'll accept."
