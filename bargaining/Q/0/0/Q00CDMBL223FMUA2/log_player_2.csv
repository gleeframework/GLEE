"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, the value of the money decreases faster for me than it does for you, so I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about 58/42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the need for a more balanced split, the rate of inflation is working heavily in my favor.  It's still early in the game, and rejecting this offer puts me in the position to propose a deal in Round 4 when the value has diminished significantly for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round makes this money less appealing for both of us. I'm proposing a 52/48 split - it's a strong offer considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  By Round 4, the shrinking pot of money should be putting pressure on Alice to make a deal.
* **Inflation Advantage:** I'm leveraging my slower inflation rate.  The offer is tilted in my favor, but the rapidly declining value for Alice might make it attractive enough to accept. 
* **Appearance of Compromise:** While the offer is advantageous to Bob, phrasing it as a more balanced split than Alice's previous offers could make it seem more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at 55/45. Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot and has come back to her original 55/45 offer.  While I was holding out for a better deal, there's a significant risk that continued rejection could lead to a worse outcome in later rounds. Accepting now secures a reasonable share considering the circumstances."
