"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob! I'm willing to give you a small amount to get the ball rolling. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can do better. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the initial $9,000, so my gain would be $8,550.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up $2,100, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a new offer in Round 3."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
