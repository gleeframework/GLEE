"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. This offer saves us both from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is good in the first round, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Inflation will hurt Alice more, so I can potentially leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's fair considering the inflation will affect you more.  Let's work together to get something before it's too late!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you drive a hard bargain. Let's meet in the middle.  This is the same split you offered, but now inflation has eaten into it even more. It's better to take this deal now before it gets any worse. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is the same as my previous offer, but inflation has reduced the value of the money.  It's better to take this deal than to risk further inflation eating away at the gains."
