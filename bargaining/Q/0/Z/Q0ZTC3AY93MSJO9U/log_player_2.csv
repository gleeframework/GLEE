Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 65/35 in my favor. This still leaves a significant portion for you, and we can avoid further depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
