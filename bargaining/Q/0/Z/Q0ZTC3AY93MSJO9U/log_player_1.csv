Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting the money depreciate further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
