Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split that reflects the long-term impact of inflation on your share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm acknowledging the inflation factor by shifting the split closer to your initial offer.  However, time is running out, and this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to my initial offer, but he's doing it far too slowly. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to let several more rounds pass if necessary.  The pressure is on him as well."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise. I'm lowering my ask again to show I'm willing to negotiate fairly. However, I won't let inflation completely erode my share.  Let's settle this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making another small concession to signal that I'm open to a deal, but it's a calculated risk. It's less than Bob's increase, keeping the pressure on him.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  By round 5, the inflation is becoming a significant factor.  I need to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Firm but Fair:**  My message reiterates my awareness of the inflation and emphasizes that I'm being reasonable. Bob needs to understand that I'm willing to walk away if he's not willing to offer a truly fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sensing your urgency and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, recognizing the time pressure we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the inflation eats further into my potential gains. We're past the halfway point, and the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly.
* **Bob's Movement:**  While this offer is still not ideal, Bob has finally made a noticeable concession. This indicates a willingness to compromise that wasn't there before. 
* **Minimal Gains:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal is very risky at this point.  The difference in potential gains is now outweighed by the risk of losing everything."
