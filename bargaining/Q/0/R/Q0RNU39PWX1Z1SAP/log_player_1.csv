I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  It's a generous offer, but I want to be sure to get the lion's share, especially given the possibility of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
