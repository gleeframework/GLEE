"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leave you with a good amount.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll have to consider the decreased value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too lopsided for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split, and I'd like to propose an alternative. It's Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 58/42 is a fairer split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving Bob with a significant amount."
