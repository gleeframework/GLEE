"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the initial value of the money. This is a fair split, considering the 5% decrease in value per round. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
