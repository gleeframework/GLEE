"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I figure it's a good starting point, and since the money loses value more quickly for him, he might be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. While it's better than my previous offer, the value of the money I'm gaining has been significantly reduced due to inflation. I'll need to propose a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself.  I'm taking into account the inflation and hoping to reach a compromise.  I'm willing to give up some of my share to avoid further rounds with even lower value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with this offer, the value of the money has decreased significantly for me due to inflation.  Accepting this offer means at least getting something, even if it's a small amount.  Rejecting it might lead to a worse outcome in the next round."
