Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer reflection of the value we both bring to the table. Let's get this done and avoid any more inflation! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
