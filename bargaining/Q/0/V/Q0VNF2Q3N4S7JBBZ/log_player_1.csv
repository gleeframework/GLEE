"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, you get a smaller share, but it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but it's a good starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a significant shift in his favor. I'll have to think carefully before accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll have to be strategic. Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to push for a more even split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 55/45 split is more reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
