Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit imbalanced, Alice. Let's be more realistic. This offer gives me a better share considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before the money is worth even less for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. However, the impact of inflation is much harsher on Bob.  
* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob's message indicates increasing desperation. He knows his potential gains are shrinking rapidly.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. He might become even more insistent on a larger share as his options dwindle.

Accepting 55% of a rapidly depreciating asset is better than risking a worse outcome later, or even reaching a point where the entire sum becomes near-worthless due to hyperinflation."
