"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best I can get, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight majority 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like the offers are mirroring each other. I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 45/55 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather accept this offer than continue negotiating."
