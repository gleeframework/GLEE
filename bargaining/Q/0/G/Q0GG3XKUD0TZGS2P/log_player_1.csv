"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Bob's message: You can take the smaller share, I'll take the larger one. No hard feelings! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 5% decrease in value, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not ready to accept the smaller share just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept it."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my share!

Considering the decreasing value of my share, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it.
