"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose keeping 90$ for myself and giving 10$ to Bob. I hope he accepts this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm not happy about only getting 10$, it's better than getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation makes the money less valuable with each round, so accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
