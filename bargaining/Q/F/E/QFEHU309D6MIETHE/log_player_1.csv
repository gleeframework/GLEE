"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to take 999,000 dollars and leave Bob with 1,000. I know this might seem unfair, but I want to ensure that I get the most of the money. Since the value of the money decreases with each round, I don't want to risk losing my chance of getting the most possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategic move.  Since the value of the money decreases with each round,  I'm taking a loss by waiting for another round. This offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money while still leaving some room for Bob to potentially benefit in future rounds."
