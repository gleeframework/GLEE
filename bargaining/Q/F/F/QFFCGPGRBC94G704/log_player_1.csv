"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you get $4,000. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth $1,800 (90% of $2,000).

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'd like to get a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the large difference in our shares. I'd like to propose a smaller difference.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so $10,000 is now worth $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll take $4,500 and you get $5,500. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```

Your turn!"
