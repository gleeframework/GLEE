Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is money!  This offer is still generous, and each round that passes hurts us both. Let's be wise and close this deal.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous!  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation with each passing round. This offer is more than fair, and you know it.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is pressuring me and highlighting her losses from inflation, I believe I still have some leverage. The 380,000 offered is better than round 3, but waiting a couple more rounds might force her to concede even more. The risk is that she'll become desperate and offer a drastically lower amount later, but I'm willing to play that game for a bit longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the pressure from inflation, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This offer is a compromise, and it's in our best interest to settle now.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome. By round 6, the pressure is mounting on both sides, and this offer keeps the door open for a deal while still leaving room for potential improvement in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, listen carefully. This is my final offer. You're playing a dangerous game with inflation, and this deal still gives you a sizable chunk. Accept now, or we both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting desperate, but her ultimatum needs to be taken seriously. While the offer isn't ideal, it's still a significant sum and better than risking a complete loss if we reach round 12 without a deal.  It's time to cut my losses and accept the deal while I still can."
