Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```

}
```

I'm offering to give myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'll still try to maximize my gain. Since the offer is still quite biased towards Bob, I'll reject it.
