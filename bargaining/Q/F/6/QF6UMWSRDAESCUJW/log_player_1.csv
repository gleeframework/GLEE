"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1. This might seem like a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the money is losing value each round. This gives us both a decent amount, and allows us to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
