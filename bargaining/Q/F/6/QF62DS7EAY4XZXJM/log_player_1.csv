**Reasoning:**

Bob is creeping up his share, but it's still not in my best interest.  While the effects of inflation are important to consider, I need to hold out for a better offer from Bob.  Each round that I reject his offer, he should logically be more willing to concede a larger portion to avoid both of us losing."
