"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more balanced, I propose 60/40, but open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to adjust my thinking. The $4,000 I'd gain in this round is only worth 80% of what I would have gained in the first round ($5,600). That's a significant decrease!

Given the inflation factor, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this proposal. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the ongoing inflation.

Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds, I'll aim to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share. Can we discuss further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32/68 split, which should give me a slightly better share considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway!"
