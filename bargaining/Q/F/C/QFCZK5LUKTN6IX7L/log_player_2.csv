"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60% for myself. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation means this deal is much better for her in the long run. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is more equitable considering the inflation we both face.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than your offer. Let's split it 55/45 this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to wear me down, but this offer is barely better than her first one considering the inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We're both losing money with each round. This offer is a compromise that benefits us both.""}
