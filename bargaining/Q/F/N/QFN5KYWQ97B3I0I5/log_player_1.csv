Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% of the money, a fair share, but I'm willing to give you 40% 
# Alice gain: 400000

Do you accept this offer?","{
