"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value faster than me, so I think 55/45 is a better split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle a bit? This deal gets us both something.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is on my side, and inflation is hitting you harder. I think 58/42 is a fair split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean I get less than my initial offer to Bob in Round 1, even accounting for the inflation.  I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be careful as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 57,
""bob_gain"": 43,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I'm feeling the pressure. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and both go home with something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I need to signal I'm willing to compromise but also show some firmness. This offer is slightly better for Bob than my Round 3 offer, but the inflation means time is running out for both of us.  The ""final offer"" message adds pressure for him to accept."
