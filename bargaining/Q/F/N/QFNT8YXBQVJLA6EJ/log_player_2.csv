**Reasoning:**

The game is getting very dangerous for Bob.  He needs to send a strong signal in the next round or Alice will continue to push her advantage. Accepting now would mean taking a heavily discounted amount."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or we both lose everything.""}

**Reasoning:**

This offer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about reaching a deal and is willing to compromise. It's a slight increase from her previous offer, making it more tempting while still securing a decent share for Bob before inflation eats further into his potential gains.  By framing it as a ""final offer"" Bob adds pressure for Alice to accept, making it clear there's no more room for negotiation."
