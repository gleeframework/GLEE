"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, as the inflation will make each subsequent round less profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. Even though the inflation has hit me harder, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I recognize that Bob might be willing to compromise after his last offer was rejected.  This split feels more fair and might encourage him to accept."
