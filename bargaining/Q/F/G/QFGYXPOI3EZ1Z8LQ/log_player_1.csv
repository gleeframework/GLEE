"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the hopes that he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50/50 split, huh? That's a bold move!

Considering the money is worth 5% less than before, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4750
* Bob gain: 4750

I'm not sure if I want to give up my chance to negotiate further, but 50/50 seems like a reasonable starting point. I'll accept this offer.
