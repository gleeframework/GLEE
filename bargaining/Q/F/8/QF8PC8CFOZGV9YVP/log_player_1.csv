"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $90 and Bob $10.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  Even though the money is worth less, I'm still in a stronger position because I get to make the next offer. I'll aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose an 80/20 split, giving me $80 and Bob $20.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the fact that I'm the one making the offer this round."
