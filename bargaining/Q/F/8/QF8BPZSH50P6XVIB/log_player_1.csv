"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a bigger share this time.

I'll think about it for a moment... Considering the inflation, my 400,000$ is actually worth 380,000$ in real terms. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up 20% of the total.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like a bit more. Let's try again!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again due to inflation, my offer will be adjusted accordingly.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, but still fair, I think!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 420,000$, which is worth 399,000$ in real terms, considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take the majority this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the majority share again!

Let me calculate the real value of the money considering the inflation...

Initially, $1,000,000 is worth 100% value.
After Round 1, it's worth 95% (5% decrease).
After Round 2, it's worth 90.25% (5% decrease).
After Round 3, it's worth 86.46% (5% decrease).

Now, after Round 4, the money is worth 86.46% - 14.26% = 72.2% of its original value.

Considering this, my gain of 300,000$ is actually worth 300,000 * 0.722 = 217,560$ in real terms.

While it's a decent offer, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up 82.8% of the real value to Bob.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like a bit more. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 72.2% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's find a middle ground!""
}
```

I'm offering 360,000$, which is worth 261,120$ in real terms, considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
