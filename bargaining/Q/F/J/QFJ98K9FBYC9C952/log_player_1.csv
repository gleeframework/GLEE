"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40. I've attached a message to try to persuade him to accept my offer. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a bit more, but let's find a compromise. This offer is more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. The game is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""
}


I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers, taking into account the fact that the money is worth a bit less now due to inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
