"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, your turn""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, leaving Bob with 30%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being a bit greedy!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, I was offering 70, which is equivalent to 56 after inflation (70% of 80). Now, Bob is offering 20, which is equivalent to 16 after inflation (20% of 80).

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, while keeping a larger share for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Time to compromise, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
