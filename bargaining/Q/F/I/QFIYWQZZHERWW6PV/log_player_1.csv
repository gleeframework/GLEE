"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 in this round is worth less than my initial gain of $6,000 in the first round. I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
