"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm confident that this is the best deal he'll get!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said I couldn't do better, let's see about that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better, huh?

Let me calculate the value of the money after the 20% inflation:

Alice's gain: $300,000 x 0.8 = $240,000
Bob's gain: $700,000 x 0.8 = $560,000

I'm not impressed. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You can't do better than this, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me a good enough deal, I'll take a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the value of the money after the 48.8% inflation:

Alice's gain: $400,000 x 0.516 = $206,400
Bob's gain: $600,000 x 0.516 = $309,600

I'm not happy about the value of the money decreasing so much, but I think I have to accept this offer. It's the best I'll get at this point.
