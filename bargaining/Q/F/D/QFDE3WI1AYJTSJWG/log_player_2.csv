"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, 10% seems too low for me. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40% for me, 60% for you.""}\n\nI'm making a more reasonable offer, considering we both want a fair share. I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle, so we can both walk away with a decent amount. Your turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share. How about 70/30? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although Alice is willing to compromise, I think I can still get a better deal in the next round. The 70/30 split is not fair enough for me, considering the inflation is affecting my share. I'll take my chances and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's try 45/55. I'm taking a hit from inflation, so I need a bit more.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, considering the inflation is affecting my share. I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to account for the loss in value. Fingers crossed!"
