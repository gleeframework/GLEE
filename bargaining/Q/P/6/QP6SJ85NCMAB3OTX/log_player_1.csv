# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 500,000 / 0.8 = 625,000. Not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do.
