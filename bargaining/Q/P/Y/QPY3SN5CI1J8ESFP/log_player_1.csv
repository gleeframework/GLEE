"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, fair and square.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split reflects the value of my time in negotiating this.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $4000, which is 80% of $5000.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 60-40 split. I'd rather not give up too much of the value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'd be getting 80% of $4000, which is $3200.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's see if this works.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving away too much to Bob."
