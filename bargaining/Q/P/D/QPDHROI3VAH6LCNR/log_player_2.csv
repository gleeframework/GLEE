Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. I'll give you a little more, but not much 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob), Alice is still not offering a fair deal. Accepting $43 now is a bad deal compared to holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice might become, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is a very reasonable offer Alice, and you know time is not on my side. Take it before it's too late!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The effects of inflation are becoming severe.  While a 50/50 split was ideal, I need to sweeten the deal slightly to entice Alice to accept before my potential gains dwindle further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not budging much 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless inflation is crushing my bargaining position. While this offer isn't ideal, rejecting it risks walking away with nothing in just a few more rounds. It's painful to accept such an imbalanced deal, but the alternative is likely worse at this point."
