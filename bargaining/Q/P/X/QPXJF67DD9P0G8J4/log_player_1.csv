"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping the majority. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if Bob is being generous or trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll decide to reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to let you take all the advantage. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and not letting him take too much advantage of the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but not quite there.

Considering that the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I think his offer is a bit more reasonable now. I'll decide to accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
