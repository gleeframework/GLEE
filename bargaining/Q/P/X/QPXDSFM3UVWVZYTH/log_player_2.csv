Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the pressure of the devaluation. This offer is a compromise.  Take $250,000 now, which is still a significant sum, or risk ending up with significantly less. Time is not on your side.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm offering you $300,000.  Take it now, or I'm walking away and you'll be left with nothing.  The devaluation is significant at this point, and it's only going to get worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, at this point the devaluation is making it difficult to get much more. It's better to take the $300,000 and end the game."
