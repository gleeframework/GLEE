950000.0,50000.0,"Let's make a deal. You get a quick $50,000, and I take the rest. It's in your best interest to accept now, as the value decreases significantly for you with each passing round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm not sure why you think that's fair.  This is a 55/45 split, which is much closer to an even distribution.  Let's try this.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, your perception of fairness seems skewed. Let's be realistic. I offered you a reasonable sum in the first round.  This is $200,000 guaranteed, which will be worth significantly less if you drag this out further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"This isn't a game of who can bully the other into accepting a bad deal. I'm willing to split the difference again. This time, 60/40 in my favor.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, it's clear you're feeling the pressure of the devaluation. This offer is a compromise.  Take $250,000 now, which is still a significant sum, or risk ending up with significantly less. Time is not on your side.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, we're both losing value with each round. It's time to be reasonable. 65/35 is a fair compromise. Accept this and we can both walk away with something.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm offering you $300,000.  Take it now, or I'm walking away and you'll be left with nothing.  The devaluation is significant at this point, and it's only going to get worse for you.",Alice,7,
