"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation is a serious concern. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the end."
