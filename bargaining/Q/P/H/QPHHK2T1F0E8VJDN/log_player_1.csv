"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth $427,500.

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I think I can do better than that, but I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
