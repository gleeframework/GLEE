"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's only fair that I get a slightly larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hitting me hard. Taking this offer ensures I get something, and it's not a huge loss compared to the original 50/50 split."
