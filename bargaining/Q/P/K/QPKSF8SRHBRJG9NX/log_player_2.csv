Alice is getting desperate, but I believe I can still get a better deal. While her offer is tempting, we are nearing the halfway point, and the pressure is on her more than me."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. I'm not going to let inflation eat away at our potential gains any further.  You're getting a significant amount, and it's time to be sensible. 
# Bob gain: 184206 
# Alice gain: 815794 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Alice is clearly drawing a line in the sand. Let's analyze:

**Pros of Accepting:**

* **Guaranteed Money:** 184,206$ is a significant sum. It's better than walking away with nothing if negotiations completely collapse.
* **Time Pressure:**  While my money isn't affected by inflation, Alice's is.  Every round that passes makes her more desperate.  However, her ""final offer"" implies she might be willing to let the whole thing collapse. 

**Pros of Rejecting:**

* **Potential for More:**  I'm betting Alice is bluffing. Her frustration is palpable, and she likely wants to secure something rather than nothing. 
* **Shift in Power:** By rejecting, I show resolve.  It puts the pressure back on Alice, potentially leading to a better offer in the next round.

**Decision Time:**

This is a gamble. I believe Alice is bluffing, but there's a real risk she's not. 

**My decision is to REJECT.**

I'm going to call her bluff. However, I need to be prepared to make a significant compromise in the next round if she's serious.  The next offer I send will need to show some movement on my part, but still aim for a larger share than what she's offering now. 

**Send:** {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 8

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we need to settle this.  Consider this my final offer. It's a compromise that acknowledges the dwindling value of your share."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're being unbelievably stubborn! I'm making a concession here, but we are running out of time.  Accept this, or we both get nothing! 
# Bob gain: 229920 
# Alice gain: 770080 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is clearly feeling the heat, but so am I. Let's analyze where we stand:

**The Situation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the last few rounds. The pressure is immense.
* **Alice's Resolve:** She's sticking to her guns, even with the increasing losses from inflation. This suggests she might be willing to walk away.
* **My Position:**  My previous offer was quite aggressive. It seems Alice is genuinely offended, and I risk pushing her too far. 

**Decision Time:**

This is incredibly risky, but I think I need to hold out for one more round.  Alice's language (""unbelievably stubborn,"" ""we both get nothing!"")  suggests desperation. 

**My decision is to REJECT.**

However, this is a calculated risk. If she doesn't significantly improve her offer in the next round, I'll be forced to accept a much smaller share than I'd like.
