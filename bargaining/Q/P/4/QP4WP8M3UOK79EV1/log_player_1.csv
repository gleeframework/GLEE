I propose you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation, but I think it's a fair starting point. Let's see if he accepts."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is less than his previous offer, but still a significant amount. With inflation, the money is losing value quickly, so I need to ensure I get a larger share."
