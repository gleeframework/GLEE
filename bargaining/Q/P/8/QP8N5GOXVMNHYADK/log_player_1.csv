I'm proposing that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000.  This seems like a fair starting point as I'm taking the larger share, but Bob still gets something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer. I'm willing to compromise, but getting only $4000 is way too low.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm proposing a 7000/3000 split in my favor. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still getting a fair share of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept."
