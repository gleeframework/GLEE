"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer 55 to myself and 45 to Alice, taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still 4 dollars more for me than the initial 50/50 offer. Considering the inflation, I'll stick with my initial strategy. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Alice's gain is worth 9.75% less, I'll try to take advantage of this. I'll offer 56 to myself and 44 to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 54 
# Alice gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still 4 dollars more for me than the initial 50/50 offer, but considering the inflation, the difference is now 3.2 dollars more for me (50 - 54 = -4, but due to inflation, the actual difference is 50 - 46 = 4, and 4 * 0.9595 = 3.838). I'll accept this offer, as it's getting increasingly difficult to reject offers that are close to the initial 50/50 split.
