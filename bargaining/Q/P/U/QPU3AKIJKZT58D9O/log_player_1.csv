"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. This is a strategy to incentivize Bob to quickly accept, as he can get more in the next round if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
This offer is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
