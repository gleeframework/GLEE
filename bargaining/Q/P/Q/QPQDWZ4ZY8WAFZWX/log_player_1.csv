"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a 990,000:10,000 split. This ensures I get the lion's share while still leaving Bob a small amount to encourage him to accept.  I'm banking on the fact he might not fully understand the inflation effect, making this a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action. 

* **Inflation:** My share is worth less now due to inflation, making Bob's offer more appealing. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means risking Bob's counter-proposal in the next round, which could be even worse for me.
* **Fairness:** While 500,000 is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount, and it's a fair split compared to the potential outcomes of further rounds."
