"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original amount, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept my offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a fairer split. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* If I accept, I'll get $4,500, which is worth 90% of the original $5,000 I would have gotten in the first round.
* If I reject and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth 95% of its original value, so I'll get 95% of the $4,500, which is $4,275.

Considering the inflation, I think it's better to accept Bob's offer and get the $4,500 now, rather than risking losing more value in the next round.
