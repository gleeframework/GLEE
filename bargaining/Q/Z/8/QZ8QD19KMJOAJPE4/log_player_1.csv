Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split reflects the time pressure we're both under.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally moving in the right direction, but this offer is still unacceptable. The longer this goes on, the more desperate he'll become.  We can afford to wait for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm standing firm. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure we both face. Let's be realistic and finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While this isn't ideal, it's time to be pragmatic. Bob is clearly not going to budge much further, and the longer this drags on, the less his offers will be worth to him, making a significant jump in his offers less likely. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even if it means conceding slightly more than initially hoped."
