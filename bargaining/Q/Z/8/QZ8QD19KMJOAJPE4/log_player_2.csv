**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing very aggressively and clearly banking on me caving under the pressure of inflation.  While the deal is getting worse, accepting a deal heavily skewed in her favor this early sets a bad precedent. I'm hoping she'll get slightly more reasonable, but I'm prepared to play hardball if needed."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm standing firm. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure we both face. Let's be realistic and finalize this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Holding Strong:** While time pressure is mounting, I need to signal to Alice that I'm not going to be bullied into a bad deal. Rejecting her last offer and proposing a similar, but slightly improved, offer for me emphasizes this.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** The clock is ticking.  I'm moving my offer closer to hers, but not so drastically that it shows desperation. 
* **Direct Communication:** The message is firm but not overly aggressive. I want to encourage Alice to settle without further escalating the situation."
