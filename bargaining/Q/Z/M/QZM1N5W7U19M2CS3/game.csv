45.0,55.0,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think we can find something more mutually beneficial. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  This accounts for the inflation we both face.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest option to avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
