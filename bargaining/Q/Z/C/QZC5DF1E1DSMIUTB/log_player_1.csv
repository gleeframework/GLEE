"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'll make sure to keep an eye on the inflation rate and adjust my strategy accordingly.
