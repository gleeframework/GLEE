Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation affecting you more. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is really hurting you. I'm lowering my ask, but I still need a significant share. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on due to inflation, accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than half the original amount.  I need to hold out for a better deal in the next couple of rounds, while demonstrating the increasing risk for Alice if we don't reach an agreement."
