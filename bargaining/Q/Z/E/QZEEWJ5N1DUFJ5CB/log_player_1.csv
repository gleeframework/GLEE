``` 
I'm going to start with a pretty strong offer. I'll take 9000 and give Bob 1000. It's a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept that! Bob's offer is ridiculous. He's basically trying to take all the money for himself. I'll wait for my chance to make a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8000 for me, and 2000 for Bob. I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I need to show I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Bob is still being greedy!  I'm not going to accept this offer. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll keep fighting for a fairer share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to continue to compromise, but this is my final offer. I'm willing to accept 7000, leaving 3000 for Bob.  If he rejects this, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. He's being stubborn and refuses to give me a fair share. I'm not going to accept this. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

We're getting closer to the end, and I need to be more flexible. I'll offer 6000 for myself and 4000 for Bob.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's fair and in my best interest to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Time to be reasonable. I'll offer a 50/50 split. It's the fairest way to divide the money and I believe Bob will accept it."
