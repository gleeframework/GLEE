Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe we can find a fairer split. Let's try 550k for me and 450k for you. This takes inflation into account and allows for a more equitable outcome. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially after considering the rapid inflation for Bob. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals he's serious about seeking a more balanced deal. The decreasing value of the money creates a strong incentive for Alice to make a better offer sooner rather than later."
