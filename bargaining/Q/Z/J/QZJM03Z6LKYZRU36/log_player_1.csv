Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm not convinced that a 70-30 split is the best I can get, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll keep negotiating!"

Here's my response:

```
{

}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get an even better deal. A 75-25 split is still too close to the previous offers, and I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give up more. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of him."
