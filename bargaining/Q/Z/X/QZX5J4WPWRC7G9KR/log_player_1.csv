{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise, but I think 30% is too low for me. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really not happy with this offer. I'm getting worried that the money is losing value quickly, and I'm not getting a fair share. I was hoping for a better deal than 20% of the total amount. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal, hoping he'll come back with something better."
