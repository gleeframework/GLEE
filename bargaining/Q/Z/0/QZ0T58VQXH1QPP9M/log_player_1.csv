"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced by your offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an 80-20 split. I think I can do better than that. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle this time.""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a more balanced compromise than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will find this more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied, I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'm running out of options. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
