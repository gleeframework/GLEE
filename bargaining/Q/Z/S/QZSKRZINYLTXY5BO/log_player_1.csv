"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable proposal.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55, you get 45.  Seems like a fair deal given the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal division considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept."
