"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after one round of inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 50-50 split. Given the inflation, this is a good offer, but I can try to do better. However, since Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, it's likely she thinks she can do better in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
