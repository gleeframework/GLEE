"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30 dollars.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual values for this round are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'll decide based on these values.

I accept the offer.
