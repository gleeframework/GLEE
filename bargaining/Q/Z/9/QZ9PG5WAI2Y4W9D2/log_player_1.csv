"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, let's start with a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd like to accept the offer. It's a more even split, and I'd rather get $4,000 now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
