"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split, how about this? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,000, and Bob's gain of $4,000 remains the same.

I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a more balanced split, but I'm not sure if it's good enough for me. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after the first round, and another 20% was lost in the second round, my offer now needs to take into account the 80% of the original 80%, which is 64% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still not giving up control!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 64:36 split, with me getting 64% of the original $10,000 and Bob getting 36%. I'm trying to stay in control and see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,400 in round 3 is now worth 51.2% of the original $8,000, which is $4,096. Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value, my gain of $4,096 is worth 51.2% of the original $8,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept it.
