Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet closer to the middle, but I think I can do a bit better than 55/45. How about 58/42?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that time is running out, but I'm not feeling the pressure. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. 57/43 is my final 'reasonable' offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, Alice is clearly trying to pressure me by setting a ""final"" offer. I need to show strength and that I'm willing to risk it for a better share. Accepting now would be a significant loss compared to the earlier rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting this done. This offer is a compromise. I'm willing to take a hit on the deal, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By round 6, the pressure from inflation is significant. While Alice is playing hardball, I need to convey that I'm also serious. Offering a 52/48 split shows I'm willing to negotiate but sets a firm boundary.  The ""final offer"" statement adds weight and might push Alice to accept rather than risk losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you said your last offer was final, but I'm willing to take the risk. Considering the inflation, I think 58/42 is a more than fair deal for you at this point. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision point. While 58/42 is significantly less than I aimed for, Alice is essentially offering her Round 3 offer again. This is unlikely to improve. Accepting ensures I get something, and waiting any longer risks a much worse outcome due to inflation. Alice calling my bluff with the ""final offer"" means I need to adjust my strategy and secure a deal while I still can."
