"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000, with the message ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point."" I'm trying to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, while still giving myself a slight advantage. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but let's meet closer to the middle. How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, while it's a more even split, I still think I can get a slightly better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't have any pressure to accept a lower offer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I see you're willing to meet closer to the middle, but I think I can do a bit better than 55/45. How about 58/42?""
}
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's still more generous to me than Bob's previous offer, but slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same to me, while Bob is facing a 10% decrease in value each round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out and the deal is getting worse with every round. 53/47 seems fair. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, even though the deal is getting worse for him due to inflation. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'm not feeling any pressure to accept a lower offer. I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round to see if I can get an even better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""I understand that time is running out, but I'm not feeling the pressure. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. 57/43 is my final 'reasonable' offer.""
}
```

I'm making a slightly more generous offer than my previous one, but still trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same to me. I'm framing it as my ""final 'reasonable' offer"" to try to put some pressure on Bob to accept, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about getting this done. This offer is a compromise. I'm willing to take a hit on the deal, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I can see that Bob is getting desperate, and the inflation is really taking a toll on his potential gain. However, I'm still not feeling any pressure since the money is worth the same to me. Considering Bob's message that this is his final offer, I'm inclined to believe that he won't go any higher. Given that the offer is still not as good as my previous ones, I'll reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I understand that you said your last offer was final, but I'm willing to take the risk. Considering the inflation, I think 58/42 is a more than fair deal for you at this point.""
}
```

I'm going back to my previous offer of 58/42, which is more favorable to me. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, I believe this offer is still relatively generous. I'm taking a calculated risk that Bob will accept this offer rather than letting the game continue and risking an even worse outcome. Let's see how Bob responds!"
