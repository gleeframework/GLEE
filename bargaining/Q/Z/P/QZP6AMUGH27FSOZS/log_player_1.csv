"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money (90%) but still gives Bob a significant share (10%). This is a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and whether he is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is offering the exact opposite of my initial offer,  which is clearly not in my best interest. I'll reject and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm decreasing my share by 50,000, but increasing Bob's share by 50,000 to see if he's willing to compromise. I still maintain the majority but am showing some willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering the same deal as in round 3, just with the roles reversed. This isn't a better deal for me, as my share is still much lower than I want. I'm not going to accept this just because the money is worth less now. I'll see if he changes his approach in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm reducing my share by another 100,000, but still maintaining a substantial majority. This should hopefully signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to give in to his demands. The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to secure a decent share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is again mirroring my offer from the previous round. While the inflation is making the money less valuable, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll continue to try and negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

This offer significantly reduces my share, but I believe it's still a good deal considering the inflation. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a favorable split. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in this offer and accepts before the inflation continues to devalue the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hitting hard, Bob's offer is still too low for me. He's mirroring my previous offer, which shows he's not willing to budge much. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm taking a big hit with this offer, but I think it's time to make a significant concession. The inflation is taking its toll, and with only 3 rounds left, I need to start considering a more balanced outcome. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the shrinking value of the money and accept this offer."
