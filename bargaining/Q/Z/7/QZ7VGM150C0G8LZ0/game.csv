70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. It's a good deal for you in the first round, considering the inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's be fair, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation that affects my share with each passing round.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a significant drop for me, Bob, and still heavily favors you in the long run. Let's see what the next round brings.",Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll come down to $65, you get $35. This accounts for some inflation impact on your end while still being fair to both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking, and this inflation is no joke.  I'm offering a 55/45 split. It's a decent deal for you, and it helps me avoid getting burned too badly by the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,"While I appreciate the offer, Bob, the split still isn't equitable considering the inflation heavily impacts you and not me.  We have time for a better agreement.",Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time. I'm at $60 for me, $40 for you. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances and gives you something worthwhile before the inflation eats away more of your share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're halfway through and the inflation is just going to get worse. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay, Bob, you drive a hard bargain.  50/50 it is. Let's just take the deal before the inflation eats away at your share any further.",Alice,6,accept
