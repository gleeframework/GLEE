Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Alice thinks this is a fair split.  I'm aiming for a majority of the money, but I want to leave her something to incentivize her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like more, the inflation is hitting hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
