"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting with a clean slate. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We have plenty of time to negotiate if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 50/50 is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best option, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'd like to propose an alternative."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still aiming for a bit more for myself. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slightly smaller share than before, but still a decent offer considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I think we should be getting closer to a split that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 45/55 is a fair split, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best option, especially since I think I can do better. I'd like to propose an alternative."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting scarcer!

{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit more aggressive, but I'm still willing to compromise. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $48, which is a slightly smaller share than before, but I'm trying to get a better deal for myself."
