"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer is pretty aggressive, as I'm taking 90% of the money and leaving Bob with just 10%.  However, I'm banking on Bob being hesitant to risk losing any money at all, especially since in the next round, my offer will be worth less to me and more to him."
