  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can always negotiate later""

Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, my gain of $600,000 is now worth $570,000, and Bob's offer of $400,000 is now worth $380,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
