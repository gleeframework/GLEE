# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose another counteroffer in the next round. The inflation is affecting Alice more, so I think I can negotiate for a better split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I'm willing to take a bit more. This is still a relatively fair split, given the circumstances.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a point where the deal makes no sense for me. I need you to agree to a split that reflects the rapid devaluation of my share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. The split is relatively close to what I've been proposing, and given the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares, it's better to secure this deal rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
