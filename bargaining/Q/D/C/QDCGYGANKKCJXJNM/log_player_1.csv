"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'm confident Bob will accept this, as he's likely to be more cautious in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the 20% inflation. It's a risky move by Bob, but I'm not willing to accept such a large disparity. I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly due to the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a relatively fair split.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm assuming he's going to be more aggressive. I'll try to offer him enough to keep him from getting too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous.  Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation to try and get the lion's share.  I won't accept such a lopsided offer, even with the inflation, because it's still a massive loss for me. I'm hoping he'll come back with a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

The inflation is starting to really hurt, but I need to hold my ground.  I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a reasonably fair split. Bob seems to be trying to exploit the inflation, but I'm hoping he'll realize that getting a deal done is more important than taking advantage of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting increasingly unfair.  Bob is pushing his luck with these offers, clearly betting on the inflation to force me into accepting something terrible. I'm still holding out for a better deal, hoping he realizes that we both need to come to an agreement to avoid getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is making it hard to secure a good deal, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will realize that it's better for both of us to reach an agreement than to risk getting nothing at all. We're at the halfway point and the clock is ticking."
