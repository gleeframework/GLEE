"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the first one to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of $4500 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5500 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm willing to accept this offer.
