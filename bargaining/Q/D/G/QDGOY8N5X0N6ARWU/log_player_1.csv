"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish early.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can end the game quickly if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to think about my future earnings.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 30%. My message is a bit more assertive, hinting that I'm thinking about the long-term consequences of this division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, and I think we can both benefit from it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, especially since it's a fair and equal split. I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and it's getting late in the game.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take 50% of the remaining $100."
