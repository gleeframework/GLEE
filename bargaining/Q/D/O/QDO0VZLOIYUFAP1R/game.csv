4000.0,6000.0,"That split seems a bit off to me. How about we try a 60/40 split in my favor?  This accounts for the fact that the money is losing value for both of us, but at a faster rate for you.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. Let's split it 55/45. This keeps things fairer and ensures we both get a decent share before the money loses too much value.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"I appreciate the compromise, but let's be realistic. The value of the money is dropping fast for you. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  Take it now, or risk losing even more in the next round.",Bob,4,

4000.0,6000.0,"Okay, I see your point. I'm willing to go with a 60/40 split in your favor, but I won't go lower. It's a significant loss for me, but I'd rather get something than risk losing everything in the next round.",Alice,5,
