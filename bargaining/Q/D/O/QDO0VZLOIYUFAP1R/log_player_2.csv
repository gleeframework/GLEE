"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%, but we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the initial offer seems heavily skewed towards Alice, the inflation rate is working significantly in my favor.  It's worth letting the game proceed and seeing what develops in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That split seems a bit off to me. How about we try a 60/40 split in my favor?  This accounts for the fact that the money is losing value for both of us, but at a faster rate for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. Let's split it 55/45. This keeps things fairer and ensures we both get a decent share before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but I think I can still get a better deal.  A 55/45 split is better than the initial offer, but it's still skewed in her favor considering the rapid devaluation she's facing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, but let's be realistic. The value of the money is dropping fast for you. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  Take it now, or risk losing even more in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. I'm willing to go with a 60/40 split in your favor, but I won't go lower. It's a significant loss for me, but I'd rather get something than risk losing everything in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good outcome for me.  Alice is finally recognizing the impact of the inflation on her share. Accepting 60/40 now secures me a good portion of the money before its value diminishes further for both of us.  Holding out for a better deal in the next round is too risky."
