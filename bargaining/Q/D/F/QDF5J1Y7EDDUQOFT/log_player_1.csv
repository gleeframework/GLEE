"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced 60/40 split is fairer.  We both have a lot to gain by reaching an agreement quickly, as inflation could erode our potential winnings in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
