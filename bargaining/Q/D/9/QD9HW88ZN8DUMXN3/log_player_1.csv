"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. It's a straightforward and fair proposal to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation risk 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the script and have a 60-40 split in his favor this time.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully. However, I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is fair, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my proposal to make it more favorable to me. I'll aim for a 55-45 split, which is still a reasonable compromise.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A 55-45 split is a more balanced proposal, considering the inflation risk.""
}
```"
