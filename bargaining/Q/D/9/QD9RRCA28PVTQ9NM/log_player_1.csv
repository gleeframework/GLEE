"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I would be getting only 45% of the initial $10,000, which is less than my initial proposal of 60%. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
