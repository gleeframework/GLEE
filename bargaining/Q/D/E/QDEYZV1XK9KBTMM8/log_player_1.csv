Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a serious offer. We both know time is against me, but I need a reasonable split. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice for Alice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of Bob's share is decreasing with each round. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **Bob's Stance:** His message indicates a sense of urgency (""final compromise"").  He's likely feeling the pressure of the decreasing value.
* **Future Uncertainty:** Rejecting this offer means risking an even lower offer from Bob in a future round where the inflation disadvantage is greater for him.

Alice's initial offer was optimistic, aiming to capitalize on the inflation disadvantage.  However, it's important to adjust expectations as rounds progress. This offer, while not perfect, secures a significant portion of the money for Alice and avoids the risk of ending up with an even worse deal."
