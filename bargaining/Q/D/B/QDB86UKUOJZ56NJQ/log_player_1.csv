"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the impact of inflation on my gains.
In each round, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. This means if I propose to take $X in a round, I actually get 0.8X in value compared to the original value of the money.

### Step 2: Consider the offer I rejected from Bob.
Bob offered a 50-50 split, but I rejected it because I thought I could get a better deal. However, with inflation, my portion of any new offer is worth less.

### Step 3: Calculate the effective value of what I offered initially.
In Round 1, I proposed 60 for myself and 40 for Bob. Considering inflation, if I were to propose the same split now, the effective value for me would be 60 * (0.8^2) because we are in Round 3, and for Bob, it remains 40.

### Step 4: Consider a new offer.
Given that Bob did not accept my initial offer and I rejected his even split, I need to find a compromise that is more favorable to me than Bob's offer but still attractive to Bob.

### Step 5: Make a new proposal.
Given the inflation and the need to compromise, I might consider offering a split that gives me slightly more than Bob but takes into account the reduced value due to inflation. A possible offer could be 55 for me and 45 for Bob, hoping that the slight increase on my side is acceptable to Bob, considering I'm taking a hit from inflation.

### Step 6: Attach a persuasive message.
The message should emphasize the compromise and the effect of inflation, highlighting that this offer is more generous than it seems due to the reduced value I'm getting.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer. Let's settle here.""}"
