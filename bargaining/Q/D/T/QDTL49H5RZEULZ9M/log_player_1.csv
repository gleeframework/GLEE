"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This is a significant advantage, but I believe it's fair to offer Bob a small share to encourage him to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Bob. Since the value of money is decreasing with each round, I'm aiming for a slightly larger share this time, but still trying to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting 0 after another round due to inflation. Even though I'm getting much less than what I initially wanted, it's still a substantial amount."
