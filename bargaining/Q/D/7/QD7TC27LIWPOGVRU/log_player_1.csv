"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, I'll take 60. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.
