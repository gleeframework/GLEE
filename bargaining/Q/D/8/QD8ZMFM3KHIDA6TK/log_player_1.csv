"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the initial $1,000,000. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair 50/50 split. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less due to inflation. Since I'm getting $500,000, its value is 95% of what I would have gotten in the first round (1 - 0.05 = 0.95). 

I'm not sure if Bob is considering inflation or not, but I'll play it safe and consider his offer. 

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
