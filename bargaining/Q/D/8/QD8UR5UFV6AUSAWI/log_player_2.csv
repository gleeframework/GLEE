"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple 60/40 split. It's a fair deal to get the game going. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early in the game to accept a 60/40 split. I'll see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and we can negotiate further if you prefer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  We're losing money quickly with these delays! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
The inflation is starting to hurt. A 55/45 split is a good compromise, and I'd rather secure some of the money now before it's worth even less."
