"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try for a more balanced start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm looking for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about a 55/45 split?""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'll give you a slightly better offer: 52/48. It's still not 50/50, but it's closer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 52/48 split, but I'm running out of options. Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I think this is a decent offer.
