"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much, let's get to the next round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not giving up enough, I'll try to get more in the next round""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 40/60, I'm hoping you'll meet me at 55/45""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than a 40/60 split, hoping Bob will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you at 55/45, but I'm not giving up any more ground, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in!

I'll take Bob's offer, since it's a better deal than what I had initially proposed, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $4,500 and hope it's enough to make it worthwhile."
