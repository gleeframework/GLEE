"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we'll both face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, considering the inflation and the risk of further rejection, accepting this offer is the most logical move."
