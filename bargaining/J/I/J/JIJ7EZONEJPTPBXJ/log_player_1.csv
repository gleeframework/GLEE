"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I offered 800,000, which was worth 80% of the initial 1,000,000. Now, in the second round, 500,000 is worth 50% of the initial 1,000,000, which is more than my original offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
