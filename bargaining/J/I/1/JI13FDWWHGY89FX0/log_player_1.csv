"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game going.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 5% less than the $8,000 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,000 * 0.95 = $3,800. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 10% less than the $2,000 he could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a small share, I'd like to keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4,500 is worth 14.26% less than the $8,000 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,500 * 0.8554 = $3,846.30. Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 27.1% less than the $2,000 he could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $5,500 * 0.7273 = $4,002.85.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""This seems like a reasonable compromise, I'll take it.""
}
```"
