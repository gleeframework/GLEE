Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's go 5500/4500, since the money is losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
