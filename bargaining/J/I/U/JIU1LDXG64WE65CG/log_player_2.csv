"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60% to her and 40% to me, I'll try to counter with a similar offer, but slightly more in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Alice's offer is even more skewed towards her side than before, and the value of her gain is decreasing at a faster rate than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Taking into account the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced offer. Since Alice's gain is decreasing in value at a faster rate, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.
