"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60% and you take 40%. This way we both benefit from dividing the money now before inflation eats into it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with 40%. I think I can get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think 55% for me and 45% for you is a fairer split, considering the money's value will drop significantly if we don't settle soon.""}\n\nNow it's Alice's turn."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split we discussed last round, but I need to take the lead on this deal. Accepting this offer ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation diminishes its value further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to settle for 45% yet, especially since I previously offered Alice a similar deal and she rejected it. I'll take my chances on the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation, I believe a 58-42 split in my favor is reasonable. The sooner we agree, the more value we preserve.""}\n\nYour turn, Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the more we both lose. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now. It's the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nFinally, a fair offer. With the impact of inflation being so significant at this point, accepting a 50/50 split seems like the wisest decision to ensure we both walk away with a substantial sum."
