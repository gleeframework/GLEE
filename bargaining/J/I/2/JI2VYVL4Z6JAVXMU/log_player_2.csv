"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the game's rules and the impact of inflation on the money's value for both players.
In this game, Bob and Alice take turns making proposals to divide $10,000. With each passing round, the money's value decreases due to inflation - by 10% for Bob and by 5% for Alice.

### Step 2: Evaluate Alice's initial offer and the decision to reject it.
Alice offered Bob $4,000 and herself $6,000 in the first round, which was rejected. This means the game proceeds to the next round where Bob makes the offer.

### Step 3: Calculate the adjusted value of the money for the current round.
Since we are in Round 2, the money's value has decreased once. For Bob, the original $10,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, or $9,000. For Alice, it's worth 95% of its original value, or $9,500.

### Step 4: Determine a strategic offer that considers the decreased value and aims to maximize Bob's gain while being acceptable to Alice.
Given the decrease in value, Bob should aim to offer a division that is slightly more favorable to himself than the initial offer but still reasonable for Alice to consider, given the decreasing value for both.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer.
Bob could offer himself $4,500 (which is more than his share in the first offer but less than half of the original $10,000, considering the decreased value) and offer Alice $5,500. This division slightly increases Bob's share while considering the impact of inflation on the money's value for both players.

### Step 6: Attach a persuasive message to the offer.
""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split to reflect the current value of the money. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decrease in value over time.""

### Step 7: Format the offer in the required JSON format.
```
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split to reflect the current value of the money. This way, we both get a fair share considering the decrease in value over time.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{4500}$"
