"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and I'll take 60%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and it's a relatively equal split. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, I think that's the fairest way to go about this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Since Bob is offering an even split, I'll consider that a reasonable proposal. However, I think I can do better than that. I'll try to negotiate a bit.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure an even split is the best for me, I'll wait for a better offer""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
