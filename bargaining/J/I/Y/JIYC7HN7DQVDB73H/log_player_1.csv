"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10 to start. I'll give you a fair deal, but don't expect any more generous offers from me!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. The message is a bit of a warning to Bob to consider accepting this offer, as I'm not planning to get any more generous in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not as generous as you thought, let's try again. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still too generous to him, and I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""You're still not getting the better deal you think you are. I'm not going to give you 70% of the money!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 54% of the money and Bob gets 46%. My message is a bit of a jab at Bob, trying to psyche him out and make him think I'm not going to give him a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but don't think you're getting off that easy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less every round. I'm not going to accept Bob's offer from round 4. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob is still not giving me a good enough deal, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but don't think you're getting the better deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 42% of the money and Bob gets 58%. My message is a bit of a mirror of Bob's message in round 4, trying to make him think I'm being generous but not too generous."
