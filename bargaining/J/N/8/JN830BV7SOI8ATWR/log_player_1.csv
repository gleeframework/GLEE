Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. This should incentivize him to accept and end the game quickly, avoiding the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even with inflation considered. I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, reducing my own share to give Bob a better chance to accept. With inflation, this is still a very good deal for me."
