Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

I propose a fair 50/50 split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not happy with that offer, Bob!  I'm willing to negotiate, but a 40/60 split is too lopsided. Let's see if we can find a fairer compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I propose a 45/55 split. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get closer to a more equitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse! I won't accept a split that's so far off from fair. Let's keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm willing to go down to a 40/60 split, but this is my final offer.  I'm losing money with each round, and I don't want to end up with nothing."
