Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, and I'm willing to wait for a better deal 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting dire. While ideally, I'd want a more equitable split, the longer the game goes on, the less my share is worth. 

* **Round 1 Value:** $4,000 was the initial offer.
* **Round 5 Value:**  $4,500 is now worth only approximately $2,958.50 in Round 1 terms due to the 34.39% inflation.

Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, knowing that time benefits her. If I reject this offer, there's a significant chance she'll offer even less next round, and that amount will be worth even less to me due to inflation.  It's painful, but accepting this offer cuts my losses."
