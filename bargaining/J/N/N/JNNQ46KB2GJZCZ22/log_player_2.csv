"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my shrinking pot. While she's right that I'm losing value each round, she's not offering anything that makes up for that loss. I need to hold out for a better deal or I risk getting a very raw deal as time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, because I won't accept anything less.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to hurt now, and Alice is clearly content to let it whittle down my potential gains. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer, and by making it my ""final offer"" I'm hoping to pressure Alice into accepting before we both lose out."
