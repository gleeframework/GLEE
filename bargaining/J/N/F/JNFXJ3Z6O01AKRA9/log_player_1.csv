"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he wants to reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $4,000. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $4,500.

I'm not too thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, but I'll give you another chance. Try to do better!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of the original amount (80% of 80% = 64%), which is $6,400. I'll aim to get a bigger share this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my lead. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
