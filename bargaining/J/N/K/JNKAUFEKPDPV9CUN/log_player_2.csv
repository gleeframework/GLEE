Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a bigger share, but I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change. I'm offering 90% for myself, and 10% for you. This is still a generous offer considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000
