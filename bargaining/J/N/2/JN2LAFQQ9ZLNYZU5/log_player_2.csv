"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we're both losing money. This offer is still generous, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the clock is ticking, Alice is getting increasingly generous due to the faster rate of her inflation.  I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both lose the least to inflation. Let's end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  Rounds are progressing, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Fairness anchor:** Proposing a 50/50 split establishes a strong point of fairness that's difficult for Alice to argue against.
* **Urgency:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I increase the pressure on Alice to accept a deal now rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I won't accept a 50/50 split.  This is my final offer, let's close the deal before we both lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure is significant:** With each round, the money rapidly loses value. We are past the halfway point.
* **Alice's inflation:**  While my losses are significant, Alice is also feeling the pressure. Her offer has improved, and she's declared it her final offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal is very risky now. Accepting a 40/60 split ensures I at least get something substantial."
