"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fair and generous offer, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm now looking at a gain of 70 * 0.8 = 56 dollars, which is a bit lower than my initial offer.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual value of the gain in Round 4...

The original value of the gain in Round 4 is 75 dollars. Considering the cumulative inflation effect (80% in Round 1, 80% in Round 2, and 51.2% in Round 3), the actual value of the gain is:

75 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.512 = 24.96 dollars

This is a relatively small amount, but I'll have to consider it carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 49.12% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual value of the gain in Round 6...

The original value of the gain in Round 6 is 85 dollars. Considering the cumulative inflation effect (80% in Round 1, 80% in Round 2, 80% in Round 3, and 51.2% in Round 4, and 67.23% in Round 5), the actual value of the gain is:

85 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.512 * 0.6723 = 18.39 dollars

This is a very small amount, but I'll have to consider it carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is now worth a mere 32.77% of its original value due to inflation. I'll aim for a high share to compensate for the significant loss of purchasing power.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 95,
  ""bob_gain"": 5
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual value of the gain in Round 8...

The original value of the gain in Round 8 is 90 dollars. Considering the cumulative inflation effect (80% in Round 1, 80% in Round 2, 80% in Round 3, 51.2% in Round 4, 67.23% in Round 5, and 79.03% in Round 6), the actual value of the gain is:

90 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.512 * 0.6723 * 0.7903 = 13.55 dollars

This is a very small amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the game. However, I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is now worth a mere 20.97% of its original value due to inflation. I'll aim for a high share to compensate for the significant loss of purchasing power.

However, I'm starting to think that it's not worth continuing the game at this point. The value of the money is dwindling rapidly, and I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.

Here's my proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 99,
  ""bob_gain"": 1
}
```

I'm making a strong offer, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual value of the gain in Round 10...

The original value of the gain in Round 10 is 95 dollars. Considering the cumulative inflation effect (80% in Round 1, 80% in Round 2, 80% in Round 3, 51.2% in Round 4, 67.23% in Round 5, 79.03% in Round 6, and 86.58% in Round 7), the actual value of the gain is:

95 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.512 * 0.6723 * 0.7903 * 0.8658 = 5.93 dollars

At this point, I think it's clear that the game is not worth continuing. The value of the money is extremely low, and I'm not sure if it's even worth the effort to make another proposal.

I'll accept this offer.
