"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the 50/50 being rejected, but I'll consider Bob's new offer.

After some thought, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, even if it's a ""good deal"". I'll try to negotiate further or make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer!

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up on my fair share!""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a more balanced split."
