"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this over with quickly. I'm taking most of it, but you get a little something for agreeing. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. This offer is too skewed in Alice's favor. Let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, roughly. We both get a decent share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still want the majority. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. With inflation, my gain is actually less than what it seems, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Let's continue!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Consider the impact of inflation on my gain.
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for me, I need to factor this into my proposal. We are now in round 4, meaning the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round for me (5% less each round, compounded).

### Step 2: Calculate the actual value of the money for me in this round.
To find the value of the money for me in this round, I'll calculate 14.26% of $1,000,000 and subtract that from $1,000,000. However, for simplicity and because the exact inflation calculation isn't provided, I'll proceed with the understanding that my share needs to be higher to compensate for this loss.

### Step 3: Determine a reasonable offer.
Considering Alice's last offer and the need to compensate for inflation, I'll aim to increase my share while still being reasonable to encourage acceptance.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer and message.
I'll propose an offer that slightly increases my share from the previous round, considering the decreased value of money for me, and attach a persuasive message.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm hoping we can meet closer to the middle. This is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient. Let's just get this done. I'm giving you a bit more this time, but I'm not budging further. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not accepting this offer. With inflation, my gain is actually less than what it seems, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. However, I also need to consider that Alice seems to be getting impatient, which might affect her willingness to continue negotiating. Let's continue!

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Reconsider the impact of inflation and Alice's impatience.
Given the increasing impact of inflation and Alice's growing impatience, I need to strike a balance between compensating for the loss in value and making an offer that Alice might find acceptable.

### Step 2: Adjust my strategy based on Alice's last offer.
Alice's last offer was $200,000 for me and $800,000 for her. To counter, I should increase my share but remain mindful of her decreasing patience.

### Step 3: Formulate a counteroffer that considers both factors.
I'll increase my share from Alice's last offer but ensure it's still reasonable and might appeal to her desire to conclude the negotiations.

### Step 4: Prepare the offer and message.
Considering the urgency and the need for a mutually agreeable solution, I'll craft a message that emphasizes the importance of reaching a deal now.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Given the inflation and your desire to end this, I'm making a serious compromise. This is as fair as it gets, considering the circumstances.""}"
