"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal, Bob. I take 9000, you take 1000. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer seems tempting initially, it's crucial to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting this offer means we can make our own proposal next round and potentially get a better deal, even considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation factor will affect Alice's share more than mine.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept a 60/40 split.  Let's go for 70/30,  a fairer distribution considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Though the inflation impacts Alice more, her share is still significantly higher than mine. I want to see if I can get a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split the money evenly this time. This way, we both get a decent share after factoring in inflation.""}
