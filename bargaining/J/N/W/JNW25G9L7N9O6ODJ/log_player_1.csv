"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a slightly larger share, but Bob still gets a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob! He's trying to be more equal, but I'm not sure if it's the best strategy.

I'll reject this offer for now. My proposal in Round 1 was a good one, and I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for Bob to make another offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This time, I'm giving Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, isn't he? He's offering me a smaller share, but it's a good opportunity to get a higher share for myself.

I'll accept this offer. It's a good trade-off, considering the decreasing value of the money.
