"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since my gain is worth less than Bob's in real terms. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still affecting the value of the money, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up much. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more value out of the deal, while still being somewhat generous. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share for now, but I think I can do better in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With my gain worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and the offer is still relatively close to my previous one. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal and hope that Bob's ""long-term"" strategy doesn't hurt me in the future!"
