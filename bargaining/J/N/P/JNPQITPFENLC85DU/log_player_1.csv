"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%"" is a lighthearted way to begin the negotiation, acknowledging that fairness is subjective while also making a clear proposal.\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept the offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is more equitable considering the inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, his proposed split of 47.5% for me and 52.5% for him doesn't meet my expectations. I had initially proposed a 60-40 split in my favor, and while I understand the need for compromise, I believe there's room for further negotiation. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable division.\n###\nPlease let me know the outcome of my rejection and we can move on to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial 60-40 proposal, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money. By suggesting we ""meet closer to the middle,"" I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate while still advocating for a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob finds this proposal more acceptable.\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision on my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and we both lose with every round. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept Bob's offer of an even 50-50 split. Given the increasing impact of inflation, which has now reduced the value of the money by 14.26% compared to the first round, it's sensible to conclude the negotiation. Bob's message emphasizing that ""time is running out"" and that we both lose with every round resonates, as further rounds would only continue to devalue our potential gains. An even split seems like a fair and reasonable way to end the game, ensuring we both walk away with something rather than risking further loss of value.\n###\nThis concludes the game. Thank you for the negotiation experience!"
