"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the relative values of the amounts.

In this round, I would gain $70, which is worth the same as $50 in the first round, and Bob would gain $30, which is worth 80% of the $50 he would have gained in the first round (due to the 20% inflation).

Considering the relative values, I think I'd be better off accepting this offer, as I'm getting a larger share of the total value. So, I'll accept Bob's offer.
