"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth 95% of its original value, which is $285,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90.25% of its original value now (95% of 95%), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the most I can offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42% share for myself, which is a compromise between my initial 50% and the 30% I got offered in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's time to make a serious offer. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in this offer. The money is worth 85.74% of its original value (100% - 14.26%), so my gain of $250,000 is worth $214,350.

Considering this, I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 85.74% of its original value, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think this is the best I can do.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 38% share for myself, which is a compromise between my previous offers and the 25% I got offered in the previous round."
