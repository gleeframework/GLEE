Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  He's going to have to be very greedy to reject this offer. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, this is a much better deal than I would get if I reject and have to offer Bob a better split next round."
