"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is a more balanced split. Accept and we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous. I'll take a smaller share, but I want it to be more substantial.""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
