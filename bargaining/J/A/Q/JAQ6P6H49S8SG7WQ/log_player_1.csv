"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, let's split the rest 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting 480,000$. However, Bob is offering me 300,000$, which is worth the same as it was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer. My current proposal is more generous to Bob, and I'm not willing to accept a smaller share.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll offer Bob a smaller share, but I'll still try to be reasonable.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 320000,

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split""
