"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and leaving $20 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of money is going to decrease for me in the next round. Let's work together to get a good outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll need to adjust my calculation.

In Round 2, the total amount of money is still $100, but it's worth less due to inflation. Let's assume the inflation factor is 0.95 (5% decrease).

My gain in Round 1 was $80, but due to inflation, its value is now 0.95 \* $80 = $76.

Bob's offer in Round 2 is a 60/40 split, which means I would gain $40 and Bob would gain $60. However, considering the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is worth 0.95 \* $40 = $38.

I think this is a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to accept it.
