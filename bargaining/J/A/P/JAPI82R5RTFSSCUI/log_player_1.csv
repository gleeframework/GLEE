I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a smaller share. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as it's a good deal for both of us in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation has drastically lowered the value of my potential gains, and another round will further reduce my share. It's better to take the 1000$ now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
