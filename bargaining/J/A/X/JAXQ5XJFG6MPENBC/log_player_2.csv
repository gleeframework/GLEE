I'm going to reject this offer.  It's much too low for me, and there's a good chance I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is fair and ensures both of us get a decent amount."
