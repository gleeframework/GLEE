"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This is a bit more in my favor, but still allows you to get a good chunk before inflation eats into it too much.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the fact that inflation hits her harder. While her offer might seem ""fair"" on the surface due to the rapid devaluation of her share, it's still skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, but this needs to be a bit more balanced considering the inflation we're both facing.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the total value decreases, especially for Alice.  It's time to nudge her towards a deal.
* **Slight Concession:** I've lowered my ask slightly from Round 2, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message highlights the shared burden of inflation, subtly reminding Alice that dragging this out hurts both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, need a bit more to compensate 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation disparity as a negotiation tactic, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor. Accepting now would be letting her take advantage of the situation. While the shrinking pot is a concern, I believe holding out for a better deal in the next few rounds is the better strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  Every round is costing us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Shift:** Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share, and the decreasing pot might make her more willing to accept a less favorable deal soon.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Offering a 50/50 split is logically sound and portrays me as reasonable.  
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure, hoping to sway Alice into accepting a reasonable deal before the value drops further."
