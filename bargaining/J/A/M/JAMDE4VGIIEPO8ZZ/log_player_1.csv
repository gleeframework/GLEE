Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is working in your favor, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor. It's a better deal for both of us than continuing to risk losing more. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is identical to Bob's initial offer, accepting is now the most logical choice for Alice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Every round that passes erodes Bob's potential gains more significantly. This incentivizes him to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
* **Final Round Logic:**  If Alice rejects this offer, she'll be making the proposal in Round 5. At that point, Bob's gains are worth even less due to inflation, making it highly unlikely he'd accept anything other than a heavily skewed deal in his favor.

By accepting now, Alice secures a reasonable gain and avoids the risk of walking away with potentially nothing if the game continues."
