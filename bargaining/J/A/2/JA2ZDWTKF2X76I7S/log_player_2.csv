# Alice gain: 5000

Inflation is really hurting your end, so think carefully!""}\nWill Alice accept this offer?\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on Alice's end, I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the changing value of the money. It's crucial to consider the diminishing worth of the funds for both parties with each passing round."
