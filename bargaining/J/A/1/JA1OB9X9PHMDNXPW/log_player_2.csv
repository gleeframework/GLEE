"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this good offer and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but this offer accounts for the time value of money. Let's be fair and close the deal.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's gain:** Bob is aiming slightly higher than a 50/50 split to account for the 20% inflation he'll face if the game goes to another round. 
* **Alice's gain:**  While slightly less than Alice's initial offer, it's still a significant amount, and she loses nothing to inflation.
* **Message:** Bob's message attempts to reason with Alice, highlighting the fairness of his proposal considering the inflation factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal than last round for both of us. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but the clock is ticking. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's gain:** Bob significantly increases his demand, reflecting the increasing impact of inflation. He needs a larger share to make up for the decreasing value of the money over time.
* **Alice's gain:** This offer is significantly less than Alice's previous offers. However, it's important to consider that Bob might be getting desperate with the increasing inflation, potentially pushing him to accept a less favorable offer in the next round.
* **Message:** Bob is applying pressure by presenting this as his ""final offer."" This tactic could make Alice more likely to accept, fearing that Bob might settle for even less in the next round due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the pressure. This is a fair offer, especially considering the time lost. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Explanation:**

The relentless march of inflation has caught up with Bob.  While this offer is less than what Alice originally proposed, it's better than what Bob offered in Round 4. Holding out further is too risky. 

Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:**  The value of the $10,000 is rapidly decreasing for Bob. Every round makes accepting an offer less appealing than the round before.
* **Alice's Resolve:** Alice seems content to wait out Bob. Her offers haven't drastically changed, implying she's comfortable with the situation.
* **Uncertain Future:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might offer even less, knowing Bob's back is against the wall.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but Bob is better off taking this offer than risking a worse outcome."
