"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and since I'm making the first offer, I think it's fair.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. It's completely unfair! Even though the money is worth less, I'm still not going to accept such a lopsided deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I propose a 60/40 split, in my favor.  Since I'm the one making the offer this round, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share than I offered him in the first round,  but I still need to make sure I get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm not happy with the 40/60 split, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. The money is worth significantly less now, but I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I propose a 70/30 split, in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise slightly to reach a deal.  It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, as the money is worth less with each passing round.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to accept."
