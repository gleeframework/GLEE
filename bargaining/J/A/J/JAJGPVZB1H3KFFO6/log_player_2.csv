"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I take $6000, you get $4000. It's in our best interest to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While a quick resolution is tempting, the inflation works much more in my favor than hers. I'm willing to bet she'll become more reasonable in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split, and we both lose less to inflation if we agree now.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a decent amount too. This is a compromise, let's avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but she's still trying to take me for a ride.  The inflation is working strongly in my favor, I can afford to wait for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but the pot is shrinking.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is fair, and we're both losing out. I'm willing to compromise, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is feeling the pressure now, but her definition of ""compromise"" is still laughable. I'm holding firm. She'll have to offer significantly more for me to consider it at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting painful for both of us.  I'm sticking to my numbers, it's your move to be realistic.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is absurd.  We are both getting completely fleeced at this point.  I'm proposing an even split. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has finally caved. An even split isn't ideal, especially since I had the upper hand with inflation, but if we wait any longer, we'll both be left with crumbs. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
