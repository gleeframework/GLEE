Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I want to maximize my share while still giving Bob a small incentive to accept. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I proposed in the first round, the inflation means my potential gains in the next round would be even lower. A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances, and I'm not sure I can do better."
