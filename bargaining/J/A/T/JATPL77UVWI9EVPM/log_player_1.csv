"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor this time. Remember that the inflation is hitting you harder than me, so it's a good deal for you as well! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
