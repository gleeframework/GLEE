"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slight lead""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a compromise, offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a fair split."
