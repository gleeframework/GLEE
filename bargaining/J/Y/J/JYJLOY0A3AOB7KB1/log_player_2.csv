Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Due to the 20% inflation per round, the value of Bob's potential share is rapidly decreasing.  Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems content to let the game continue, knowing that Bob is the one most affected by the time passing.  She might not be willing to offer anything significantly better. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While $250,000 is a far cry from an even split, it's still a significant sum. Rejecting this offer and potentially receiving even less in a later round would be a huge loss. 

It's a tough decision driven by a heavily skewed game, but at this point, cutting losses and taking the offer makes the most sense for Bob."
