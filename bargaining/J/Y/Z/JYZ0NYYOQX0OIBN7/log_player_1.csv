"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to convince Bob that this is a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. At the same time, I'm aware that the money is worth 10% less for Bob with each passing round, so I'm trying to find a balance that will be acceptable to him. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a generous offer and accept it, ending the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation we'll both experience. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I still think I can get a better deal. Bob's offer of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for himself is not as good as my initial offer, and I'm not convinced that it's a fair split considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob with each passing round, I'm hoping that he'll be more willing to compromise in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $430,000 and take $570,000 for myself. I've taken into account the fact that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the initial round. I believe this offer is more reasonable considering the inflation, and I've included a message to try to convince Bob of this. Since Bob's previous offer was not acceptable to me, I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to him. I'm still trying to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and offering enough to Bob to make it worth his while to accept."
