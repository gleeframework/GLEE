"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get equal parts of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my proposal to account for the reduced value of the money. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the continued inflation and the reduced value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. However, Bob's offer is relatively close to my previous proposal, so I'll decide to accept this one.
