60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a simple 60/40 split. It's a fair deal to kick things off.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm thinking we can do better than 60/40. How about 55/45? It's a bit more balanced, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. Plus, with inflation looming, I want to make sure I get a fair share before the money loses value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go up to 58 for you, leaving me with 42. It's a slight adjustment from my initial offer, but I think it reflects a fairer split considering the time pressure and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, considering the inflation, I need to push for a bit more. How about 57/43? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair split given the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's try to meet in the middle and wrap this up!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and this back and forth isn't helping either of us.  I'm proposing 56/44. It's clear we both want a larger share, but we need to reach an agreement before inflation eats away at the value. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
41.0,59.0,"I understand your concern about time, Alice, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I need to aim higher to make up for the loss. I'm proposing 59/41, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. However, I believe it's necessary to ensure I get a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle and finalize this!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand that inflation is a concern for you, but I need you to meet me halfway. We are running out of time, and this offer is a balance between fairness and urgency.  Let's settle this now before we both lose out.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a balance, but with the significant impact of inflation on my share, I need to propose a slightly higher amount for myself to make this deal work. I'm thinking 58/42 could be a fair split, considering the time pressure and the loss in value I'm facing. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, showing my willingness to compromise. Let's hope we can finalize this agreement before it's too late!",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
54.0,46.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire! I'm offering 54/46. This factors in the time pressure and the inflation working against you. Let's be pragmatic and end this now before we both get nothing!",Alice,9,
