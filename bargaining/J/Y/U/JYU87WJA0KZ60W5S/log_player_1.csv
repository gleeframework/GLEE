"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than a 25-75 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my part in this negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. I think it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the value of my potential gain decreasing even more.
