# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but Bob is still losing a significant amount of value.  There are only a few rounds left, so it's crucial to hold out for a more equitable split."

Round 8

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only three rounds left, the value of the money Bob receives is significantly diminished by inflation.  It's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a better deal. Accepting this offer will secure some value, even if it's significantly less than what Bob initially hoped for."
