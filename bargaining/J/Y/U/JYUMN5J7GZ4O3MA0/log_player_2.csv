{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced split. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share even further.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair split, but your proposal wasn't taking the inflation into account.  This offer is a compromise, considering the money loses value quickly for me with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
