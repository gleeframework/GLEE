Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a 45% share, which is still generous considering the value of the money is decreasing.  Let's split it fairly and avoid losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
