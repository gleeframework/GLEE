"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $5,500 and give Bob $4,500. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, suggesting that this division is reasonable and equitable, considering we both want a significant share but also want to conclude the game efficiently. The slight bias towards me accounts for the fact that the money's value does not decrease for me with each round, giving me a strategic advantage in prolonged negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the changing value of the money. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the appeal to end the game quickly and the mention of the changing value of money, the proposed split of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for Bob seems unfair from my perspective. Given that the money's value remains constant for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I have an incentive to prolong the negotiations to either get a better offer or to wait for Bob's share to devalue further, making my potential gain more significant in comparison."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Consider the future value""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose to take $5,800 and give Bob $4,200. The message ""Consider the future value"" aims to remind Bob that with each passing round, his potential gain decreases in value by 10%, making it advantageous for him to accept the offer sooner rather than later. This division slightly increases my share from the first round, reflecting the strategic advantage I have due to the inflation affecting only Bob's share."
