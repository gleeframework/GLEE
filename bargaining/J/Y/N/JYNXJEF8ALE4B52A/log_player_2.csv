"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5500

I want to see what Alice will propose in the next round, and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, given the changing value of the money. Let's end it here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider the future value 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is eating away at my potential earnings. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant gain, even with the reduced value. It's better to take what I can get rather than risk losing more in the next round."
