Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. I'm willing to take a bit less than before, but I still deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but the longer we wait, the less your share is worth. Take this offer before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 430000

{""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My share is rapidly diminishing, and I'm offering you a very fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, Bob. Your share is indeed diminishing, but I'm not going to give in. This is my final 'generous' offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are too severe to ignore. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer guarantees me something. 

If I reject this offer and we go another round, the value of my share will plummet even further, making it highly likely that I'll be forced to accept an even worse deal in the end.
