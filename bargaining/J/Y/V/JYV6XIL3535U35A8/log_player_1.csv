"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us a good chance to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more for being the better negotiator 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's offer!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I made the first offer and is trying to get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 40% of the total amount. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving away too much""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to keep a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable compromise and accept the offer."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob that's not quite to my liking!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a fair share""}

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where both of us can be happy with the deal. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal than my previous offers, but I'm still trying to keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 47.5% of the total amount. I think Bob is still trying to get a slightly better deal than me, and I'm not willing to give in that easily. I'll keep negotiating and try to get a better offer!"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 again""}

I'm going back to my initial offer, and I'm willing to meet Bob halfway again. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope Bob will see it as a good opportunity to end the negotiation and split the money evenly."
