Let's see if Bob likes a 90/10 split.  I'm hoping to get as much of the money as possible early on before the inflation hits too hard!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering a much more even split now, but I'm hoping I can get a better deal. I'll reject this and see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try and get closer to my original offer from round 1, but I'll give Bob a bit more this time to see if it's enough to sway him.  I'm still trying to maximize my share early on before inflation really starts to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal split, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject this and see what he offers next round.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I'm still confident I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this round. He's getting more and more desperate with the inflation, but I'm still trying to get a good share of the money.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's getting desperate. While this isn't my ideal split, it's a decent deal, and I'm worried things might get worse for me if I keep rejecting offers.  It's time to accept and secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
