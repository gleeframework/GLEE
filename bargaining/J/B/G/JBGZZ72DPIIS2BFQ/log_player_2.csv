"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer seems fair on the surface, but Alice is losing value much faster than I am due to the inflation rates. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in later rounds as the money becomes less valuable to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more, but still a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is right, she's taking more into account the inflation, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The devaluation of the money is hitting her much harder than me. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5000,

""message"": ""Let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""
