"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total amount, which is $200,000. I'll take the remaining 80% for myself, which is $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think it through.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $100,000, which is worth 80% of the original $125,000 (20% less).

Considering the reduced value, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is $400,000. I'll take the remaining 60% for myself, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is losing value fast!

Considering the reduced value, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $200,000, which is worth 64% of the original $312,500 (48.8% less).

While it's not a great deal, I think I can do even worse if I don't accept this offer. I'll take the $200,000 and hope to do better in future rounds.
