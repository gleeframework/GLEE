"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'd rather not accept a 50-50 split that's equivalent to a 45-45 split in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time, but still aiming to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I can gain. Considering the offer from Bob, I think I should accept it, as it's a relatively fair split and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
