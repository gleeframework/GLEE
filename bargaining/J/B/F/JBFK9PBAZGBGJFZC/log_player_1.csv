"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair division, and I believe it is better for us both than rejecting each other's proposals and risking losing more money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
