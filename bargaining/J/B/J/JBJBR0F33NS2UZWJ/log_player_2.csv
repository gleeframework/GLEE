Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite steep. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This round is your last chance to secure a decent sum before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  A 50/50 split seems the most reasonable.  We both get a good amount, and we avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
