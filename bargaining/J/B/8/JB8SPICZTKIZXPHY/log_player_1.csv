"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm trying to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a generous offer, I'll try to meet you in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually more generous than it seems. Since my offer in the first round was already quite generous, I'm willing to meet him in the middle.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
