Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too one-sided, Alice. Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, taking less doesn't make sense for me, and this gives you something now rather than risking less later. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
