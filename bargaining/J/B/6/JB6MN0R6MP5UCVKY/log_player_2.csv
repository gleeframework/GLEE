"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  We can adjust later if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can find a good compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're both losing money with each round, so it's in our best interest to find a compromise quickly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, it's clear that the longer we wait, the less both of us will get.  An even split is a fair compromise in this situation."
