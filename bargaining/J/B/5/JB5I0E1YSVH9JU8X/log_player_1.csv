"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly. This will leave me with a significant share of the money and hopefully avoid too much inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a risky move, but I believe it's worth it.  Rejecting Bob's offer forces him to make a proposal in the next round, where I'll be able to take advantage of the inflation affecting him more than me. I'm willing to gamble on the chance of getting a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount to Bob this round, but I'm still trying to end the game quickly before the inflation impacts my share too heavily.  I hope that this offer is tempting enough for him to accept."

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While this is a significant drop in what I'm offered, I believe the inflation will affect Bob more heavily than me in the following rounds. This puts me in a better position to negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

With each passing round, the inflation is becoming a serious factor. I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and ending the game before we both lose too much. This offer still gives Bob a decent share, but I'm trying to secure a majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Despite the significant drop in my potential gains, I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. The inflation is impacting him much more heavily than me, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, where I'll be the one making the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

This is a risky offer, but the inflation is starting to hurt both of us.  I'm trying to find a middle ground where I can secure a decent share while also incentivizing Bob to accept.  I'm hoping the offer is attractive enough to end the game before the inflation completely decimates our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. The inflation is clearly hurting him much more than me, and I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to hold out.  This is a crucial moment in the game; I need to keep pushing for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

The inflation is starting to get serious, and I'm feeling the pressure.  This offer gives Bob a more substantial share than my previous offers, hoping to incentivize him to accept and end the game.  The remaining rounds are dwindling, and I need to secure a deal before we both lose too much."
