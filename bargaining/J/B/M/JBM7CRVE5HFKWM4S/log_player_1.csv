"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 7000 for me and 3000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 5000, and we can split the remaining 1000 in half. This way, we both get a decent amount, and the decreasing value of money is somewhat mitigated. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
