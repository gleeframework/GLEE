"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you a good deal, and we can both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each passing round, I'm hoping to negotiate a higher share that would offset this loss. Let's proceed to the next round where I'll make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair offer. If we delay, the money's value will decrease further for both of us, but more significantly for me. Let's settle on this to minimize loss.""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to find a balance that considers the impact of inflation on both of us. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for me with each round, I'm hoping Alice will see the mutual benefit in accepting this proposal sooner rather than later."
