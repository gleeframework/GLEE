I'm going for a high share in the first round, aiming for a 90/10 split. This is a risky move, but it sets a high starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my first offer.  I'll reject and try to negotiate something more equitable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going for a 60/40 split in this round.  Since the value of my gains decreased due to inflation, I need to find a balance between a fair share and a high enough offer to avoid further losses."
