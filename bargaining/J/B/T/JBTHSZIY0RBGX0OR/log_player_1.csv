"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but I'm also aware of the inflation. Let's split the money fairly.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite low. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 75/25 split in your favor.  This considers the inflation impact on your end. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
