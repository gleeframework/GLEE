"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm thinking a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering your offer was quite generous.  Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept Bob's revised offer. His proposal is actually more generous to him than my original proposal was to him, and I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob. Since the money is worth less, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% if you meet me halfway""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more generous to me than Bob's previous offer. Your turn!"
