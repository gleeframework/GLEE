"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal: 9000 for me, 1000 for you. Let's be reasonable and finish this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 1000$. I can do better than that, especially knowing that the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's finish this round and both get a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's meet in the middle at 60/40. It's fair, and we can both get a good share before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing in further rounds, accepting this offer is the best option."
