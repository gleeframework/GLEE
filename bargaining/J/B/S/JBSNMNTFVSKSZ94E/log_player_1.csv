"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a slightly more even split this time. Let's see if we can work this out before the money starts losing its value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a more even split, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money losing value at a faster rate for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation affecting my share. Consider this a final offer for now.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to."
