"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly. I'm willing to give you a good share.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I need a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than the last offer. Let's split it more evenly.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the deal is bad, it's better than getting nothing in the next round. With 48.8% inflation, it's more likely Bob will take the entire 100 in the next round, leaving me with nothing."
