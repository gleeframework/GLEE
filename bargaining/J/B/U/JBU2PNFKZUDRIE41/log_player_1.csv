Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite bold.  Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the risk I'm taking by declining your offer.  Think carefully, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
