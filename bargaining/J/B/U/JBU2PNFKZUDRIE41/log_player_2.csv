{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite bold.  Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the risk I'm taking by declining your offer.  Think carefully, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still believe a 55/45 split is fair given the shrinking value of the money.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Accepting $4,500 now is better than risking a worse offer in subsequent rounds. 
* **Shift in Power:**  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, moving closer to a more even split. If Bob pushes too hard, he risks Alice becoming less generous in future rounds. 
* **Unknown Future:** There's no guarantee Bob can secure a better deal. Alice might become more stubborn, leading to a worse outcome for Bob due to inflation. 

Accepting the offer in Round 3 secures Bob a reasonable sum while minimizing potential losses from the decreasing value of the money.
