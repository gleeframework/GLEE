"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. In the first round, my gain was $700,000, which is worth $700,000 / 1.05 = $666,667 in the second round. Bob's offer of $400,000 is higher than that, so I'll accept it.
