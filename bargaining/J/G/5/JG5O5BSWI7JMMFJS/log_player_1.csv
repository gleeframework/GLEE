"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can end the game quickly."

# Bob's message: I'll take 5000, you take 5000. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the offer is actually 9,500$ for me, which is a decent amount, but I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but I'm willing to give you a bit less to get a slightly larger share.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my original idea of a 50/50 split. Let's meet in the middle again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The 50/50 split is a tempting offer, but considering the inflation, the actual amount is now worth 7,800$ for me, which is not as bad as it seems. I'm not sure if I can do better, and this way, we can finally end the game.
