"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob receives 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about it.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 25% of the total amount. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal and hope to do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you 40%, but I think I deserve more""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob receives 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55:45 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept a 55:45 split, which means I'll get $450,000 and Bob will get $550,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to play and risking even more value erosion due to inflation."
