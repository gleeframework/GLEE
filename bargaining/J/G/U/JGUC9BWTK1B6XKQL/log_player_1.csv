"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a better deal, Alice. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 75-25 split, which is a bit too skewed in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, Alice. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is still a 55.5-44.5 split, which is still not in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing money value!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the end, Bob. Don't expect me to give in easily!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split, trying to get a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I need to be extremely cautious.

However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a very reasonable proposal considering the current state of the money. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the future, so I'll accept this one.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
