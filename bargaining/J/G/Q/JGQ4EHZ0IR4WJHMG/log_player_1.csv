Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, taking 50% is still a decent outcome, especially given the risk of further rounds and potential inflation affecting Bob's offer."
