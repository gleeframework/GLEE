"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money worth 20% less again, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and make a deal."
