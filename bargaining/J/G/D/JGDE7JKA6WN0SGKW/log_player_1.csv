"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than an 80/20 split. Let's try for a 50/50 split this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
