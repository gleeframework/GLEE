"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the value of the money Bob gains.

I'll calculate the value of Bob's gain in the first round, which was 5000$. With a 20% decrease, that's 5000 * 0.8 = 4000$. So, in this round, Bob's gain of 6000$ is actually worth 4800$ (6000 * 0.8). This is a slightly better deal for me than the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

However, I'm not sure if I want to settle for this compromise. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 4000$ for me and 6000$ for him, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me. I'll offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a reasonable compromise.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""A slight tweak to the previous offer, hope this is more to your liking!""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share than before, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of Bob's gain in the first round, which was 5000$. With a 48.8% decrease, that's 5000 * 0.516 = 2580$. So, in this round, Bob's gain of 7000$ is actually worth 3612$ (7000 * 0.516). This is a significant decrease in value for Bob.

Considering the value of my gain remains the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer. While it's still a decent compromise, I'm not sure if I want to settle for a smaller share. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 3000$ for me and 7000$ for him, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. I'll offer him an even smaller share, but still a reasonable compromise.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share than before, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all my gains! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of Bob's gain in the first round, which was 5000$. With a 67.23% decrease, that's 5000 * 0.326 = 1630$. So, in this round, Bob's gain of 8000$ is actually worth 2616$ (8000 * 0.326). This is a significant decrease in value for Bob.

Considering the value of my gain remains the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer. While it's a very small share for me, I'm not sure if I want to settle for such a low amount. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

{
