"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less. This means that the effective split is 60-36.8.

I'll consider this offer. I'd like a slightly better deal, but this is an improvement from the previous round. I'll accept this offer.
