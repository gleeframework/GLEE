"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, $4000 is equivalent to $5000 in the first round, and $6000 is equivalent to $7500 in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I'm willing to accept it. So, my answer is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
