"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and keep the rest, a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty aggressive offer from Bob!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $200,000, which is a decent amount. However, Bob is keeping a significant 80% of the total, which seems unfair considering I'm only getting 20%.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the first round (5% less than the second round), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount than I initially proposed, but still a bit more than the 40% he would get if we were splitting the remaining amount equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep the rest, a slightly more generous offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another aggressive offer from Bob!

Considering the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob compared to the first round, his offer is actually a bit more generous than it seems. However, I'm still getting a relatively smaller share.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting $400,000, which is a decent amount. However, I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 19.53% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm offering to Bob, while still keeping a slightly higher share for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."
