"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, my gain of 4000 in Round 2 is equivalent to 3,800 in Round 1. Similarly, Bob's gain of 6000 in Round 2 is equivalent to 4,800 in Round 1.

I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me, and 20% less for Bob, compared to Round 2. Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 4000 for me and 6000 for him, I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
