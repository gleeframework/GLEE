Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more than 40%. How about 56-44? 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about needing to compromise, the inflation heavily favors me.  I can afford to be a bit bolder and wait for a better offer. Each round that passes, the deal gets significantly worse for her, while my potential gains remain the same."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  Every round costs you significantly.  I'm offering 62-38.  Take it before it gets even worse."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. The message highlights the time constraint and the negative impact of inflation on her potential gain. By offering a slightly better split than before (62-38), I'm still aiming for a favorable outcome while acknowledging the need for a compromise."
