Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll be willing to accept it in the first round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is not ideal, I will accept it.  I'm losing 20% of the value of my potential gain with each round, and continuing to reject offers risks getting nothing at all.  It's better to take something than nothing."
