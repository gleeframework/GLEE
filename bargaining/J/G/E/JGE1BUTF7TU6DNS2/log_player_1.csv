"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. The message is a simple explanation of my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair compromise, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain is now $7,200 (80% of $9,000).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 2:3 split, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
