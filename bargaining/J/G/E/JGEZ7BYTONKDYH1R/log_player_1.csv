"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, let's see if you'll accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the initial value, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 60-40 is a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it."
