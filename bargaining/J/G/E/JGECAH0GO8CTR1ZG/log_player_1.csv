"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole 100$ if you don't make a counteroffer!""
}
```

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it roughly in half, seems fair 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'll get $20 and he'll get $80. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since it's a relatively fair split, I'll accept his offer.
