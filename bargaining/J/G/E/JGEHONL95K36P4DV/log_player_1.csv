"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, leaving a small amount for Bob. This aims to secure a large portion of the money while still offering something to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1000, it's a very small portion of the total money. By rejecting, I have a chance to propose a better deal in the next round, potentially securing a larger share of the remaining funds."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to 8000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  While the inflation may make the money worth less in the next round, it's still a significant gain for him. This proposal aims to strike a balance between securing a large portion for myself and potentially reaching an agreement before the money loses further value."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While $2000 is a larger amount than in the previous round, it's still only 20% of the total money. With 8 rounds remaining, I believe I can secure a significantly better deal. I'll continue to negotiate and hope to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share again to 7000, aiming to find a middle ground. Bob has shown a preference for a larger share, and this offer reflects that while still securing a substantial portion for myself.  We are now halfway through the rounds, and I want to make sure we reach an agreement before the value of the money deteriorates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While $3000 is a larger amount than the previous round, it's still less than 30% of the total money.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making a final effort to secure a fair deal before the inflation significantly impacts the money. This offer gives Bob a larger share than the previous round while still ensuring a significant portion for myself. With only five rounds remaining, it's crucial to reach an agreement and avoid losing everything."
