Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40.  I think this is a fair deal that recognizes both of our contributions. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting 400,000 now might seem okay, but it's important to factor in the lost value due to inflation. It's worth pushing for a better deal for a couple more rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This split acknowledges the impact of inflation on my end while still giving you a significant share.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm flipping the script and offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This does a few things:

* **Shows I'm serious:** Alice needs to understand I'm not going to simply accept a bad deal.
* **Accounts for inflation:**  The 60/40 split in my favor helps compensate for the rapidly devaluing money.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might counter with a 50/50 split, which would be an acceptable outcome at this stage."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both feeling the pinch of inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split is a fair deal, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation. While we could push for a slightly better deal, the risk of losing everything becomes very real if we don't reach an agreement soon. Accepting now guarantees a significant sum, even with the inflation losses."
