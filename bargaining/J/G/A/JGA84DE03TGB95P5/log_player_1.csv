Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 990,000 - 10,000 split. It's a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share while ensuring I get the majority. Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is insulting. While I understand the game dynamics and the inflation, I refuse to accept a mere $10,000.  I will take my chances and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering a 900,000 - 100,000 split.  I'm willing to give Bob a more significant share this time, but I still need to secure a majority. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation."
