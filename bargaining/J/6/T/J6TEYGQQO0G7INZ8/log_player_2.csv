"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the risk of inflation and the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 3:1 ratio seems like a good deal now, I'm wary of the inflation. 12 rounds is a long time, and the value of my share could shrink significantly.  I want to see what Alice offers in the next round after the inflation hits."
