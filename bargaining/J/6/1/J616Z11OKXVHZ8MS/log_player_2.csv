Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to be generous.  Take a bigger share this time, but let's end this game.

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting tired of this game. Take a bigger share, but let's end this now. We're both losing money with every round! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and her offers are slowly increasing.  While $150,000 is a significant sum, it's still a small fraction of the total. Holding out might result in an even better offer from Alice in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're past the halfway point.  Take this offer - a cool 25% is still a lot of money - and we can both walk away winners.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With each round, the pressure on Alice increases due to the inflation affecting her potential gains. It's time to increase the pressure and demonstrate that time is running out.
* **Firmness:** Offering a slightly higher amount than her last offer ($150,000) while still holding a strong position shows firmness but also a willingness to negotiate.
* **Simplicity:**  Keeping the message clear and focused on the benefits for both sides is key."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're both being stubborn.  This offer is better for both of us than walking away with nothing. Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is increasing, but she's clearly getting desperate. Her message indicates she's worried about getting nothing. We're getting close to the point where the inflation will really start to bite for her, so it's worth holding out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 780000,
""alice_gain"": 220000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a final chance to walk away with a sizeable sum. Let's end this now before the inflation eats away at your gains even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** Time is running out for both players, but especially for Alice. Lowering the offer slightly increases the pressure while still leaving the door open for a deal.
* **Finality:**  Using phrases like ""final chance"" and emphasizing the diminishing returns creates a sense of urgency.
* **Balance:**  The offer is still heavily in Bob's favor, but it acknowledges Alice's position and offers her a reasonable sum, especially considering the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're in the 9th round. Time to be realistic.  I'm offering you a decent chunk of the money, but we both need to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is making more concessions, and her message shows a growing fear of losing everything.  While she claims it's time to be ""realistic,"" she's still aiming for a much larger share. With only a few rounds left, the inflation working against her will likely push her to make even better offers.  The risk of getting zero is outweighed by the potential for a much larger gain in the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're down to the wire.  Take this 20% now, or risk walking away with absolutely nothing.  The choice is yours.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimate Ultimatum:**  With only two rounds left after this, the time for negotiation is practically over. This offer is a strong signal that Bob is unwilling to budge further. 
* **Highlighting Risk:** The message focuses heavily on the very real danger of getting nothing if Alice continues to refuse. 
* **Inflation Factor:**  The shrinking value of the potential gain for Alice is the most powerful tool at this stage. Emphasizing the ""20%"" figure underscores how much she stands to lose by rejecting.  

This is a high-stakes gamble. If Alice is stubborn, they both lose. But the pressure is immense, and this might be enough to make her accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're on the brink of losing everything. This is my final offer. Let's compromise and walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is it - the final gamble. Alice is clearly terrified of getting nothing, and her offer reflects that. However, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. There's a very real chance she's bluffing, hoping Bob will panic and accept a less than ideal deal at the last second.  Bob has come this far, and the potential reward for holding out one more round is huge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 850000,
""alice_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is absolutely it. Take this $150,000 right now, or we both get ZERO.  Don't let your greed ruin us both!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Stand:**  This is the final offer, the very last chance for either player to get anything.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering $150,000 (a small increase) might be just enough to convince Alice to accept something rather than nothing.
* **Fear Factor:**  The message hammers home the consequences of not accepting â€“ a complete and utter loss for both players. 

It's a risky strategy, as Alice may misinterpret this as a sign of desperation.  However, the potential reward of getting 85% outweighs the risk of getting nothing at this point. This is the final gamble in this high-stakes game of chicken."
