"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can give me 60, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking for a good deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer. My current gain of 40 is not enough, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, you can give me 55, it's a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, hoping to get a better deal than what Bob initially offered in round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60, you can give me 40, it's getting closer to the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money Bob gains being worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think 60 is a good offer from Bob. It's closer to the middle, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
