"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking.  Let's be fair, I'll take the same split you offered, but in my favor.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable.  We both lose money with each passing round.  How about an even split, 50/50?  It's the fairest way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could try for a slightly better deal in a later round, accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable gain.  The longer I wait, the more we both lose to inflation, making this offer the safest option at this stage."
