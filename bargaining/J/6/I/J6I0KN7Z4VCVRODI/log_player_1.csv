"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split it 8000 for me and 2000 for you. This seems fair given the potential for inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 5500 for me and 4500 for you.  This is a more even split, and I believe it's fair considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
