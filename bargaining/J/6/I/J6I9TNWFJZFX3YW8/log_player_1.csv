"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling a little greedy this round, so I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's see how you feel about that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since I'm the one making the next offer, I'll think carefully about how to counter.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Given the 5% inflation, the money is worth less now, so I'll aim for a higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You were a bit greedy last round, so I'm taking a slightly bigger share this time. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my take slightly, but I think a 52.5/47.5 split is fair. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. A 52.5/47.5 split is still not ideal, but it's a compromise. I'll consider it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
