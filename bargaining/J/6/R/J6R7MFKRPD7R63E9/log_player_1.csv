"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'd get $600,000 and Bob would get $400,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 45% is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's find a mutually beneficial deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
