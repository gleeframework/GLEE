I'm taking a very risky strategy here.  I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll take it rather than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal for me than getting almost nothing in the next round due to inflation. It's a fair split, so I'm happy to accept."
