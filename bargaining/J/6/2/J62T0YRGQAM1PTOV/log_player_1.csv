"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  It's a high initial offer for Alice, but allows for some negotiation room if Bob wants to counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, and although the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still in a strong position.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a significant amount. This should demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still keeping a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I believe is a fair split, even with the inflation factor.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer, but still offering Bob a substantial sum.  However, I am approaching the point where I might consider accepting a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation has reduced the value of both our gains significantly, a 50/50 split is still not desirable for me. I'm willing to take some risk and see if I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but still aiming for a larger share. The pressure is mounting, and Bob's offers are becoming more tempting, but I'm not ready to concede yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still not acceptable to me.  While the inflation is hurting, I still believe I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm significantly reducing my offer.  This is a very close to 50/50 split and is likely to be acceptable to Bob, given how much inflation has eroded the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, the inflation has severely reduced the value of the money, especially for Bob. While I would prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is the best I can realistically expect at this point. I'll accept it."
