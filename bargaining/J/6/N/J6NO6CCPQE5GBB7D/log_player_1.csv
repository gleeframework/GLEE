Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most sensible move.  The inflation factor will only work against me in the long run, and Bob's offer guarantees a decent sum of money. It's time to secure the bag!"
