# Alice's message: You're losing value faster, don't wait! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is getting tight, but accepting an offer where I receive less than half of the initial amount while still losing value much faster than Alice isn't a winning strategy. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, otherwise Alice will keep lowballing me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""This offer is a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate, but the split needs to reflect the shrinking pot.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your value is dropping fast, take it! 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 39/61 split is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds. The longer the game goes on, the more I lose due to the higher inflation rate. Alice is clearly aware of this and pushing her advantage, but at this point, something is better than nothing."
