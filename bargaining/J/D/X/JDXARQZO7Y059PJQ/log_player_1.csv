"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation rate. This is a 7:3 ratio in my favor, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than you offered me initially. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
