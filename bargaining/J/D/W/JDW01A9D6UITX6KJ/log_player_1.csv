"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's see if we can agree on something that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to adjust my expectations.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is fair, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing faster for Bob. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. Your turn, Bob!"
