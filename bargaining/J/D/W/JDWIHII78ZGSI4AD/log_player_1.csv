"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to be aggressive 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value, the offer from Bob is equivalent to $3,000 for me and $7,000 for him, which is a 30-70 split.

I'll reject this offer. I think Bob's aggressive move is a bit too steep, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You were too aggressive, now it's my turn to push back""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more extremes 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% decrease in value, the offer from Bob is equivalent to $3,650 for me and $3,650 for him, which is a 50-50 split.

I think this is a reasonable offer, and considering the inflation, it's a fair compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
