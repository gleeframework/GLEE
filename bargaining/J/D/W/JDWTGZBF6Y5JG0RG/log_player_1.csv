"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This is my first offer. I want to maximize my share of the money in the first round,  hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a very unfair offer, and while it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, I'm going to reject it. It's still early in the game, and I can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping to incentivize him to accept. I'm also aware of the inflation, so I'm taking a smaller cut for myself to make the deal more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a very unfair offer, and I'm not willing to settle for so little. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm hoping we can come to a more equitable agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share again, hoping to find a compromise. The inflation is getting more significant, so I'm willing to take a bigger hit to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is really starting to bite. However, I'm not going to give in yet. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is getting risky, but I'm still hoping Bob will see the value in a compromise. With the inflation, I'm losing a lot of potential earnings, and I need to get something before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still hoping to get a better deal. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I am not ready to give in just yet.  I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm taking a big risk here, but with the inflation, I'm running out of time. This is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest we can do at this point.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's better to get something now than risk getting nothing at all."
