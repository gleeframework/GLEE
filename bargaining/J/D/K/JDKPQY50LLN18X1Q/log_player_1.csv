"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. It seems fair given Bob's slight inflation advantage.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  The inflation is starting to bite, and if I reject, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round."
