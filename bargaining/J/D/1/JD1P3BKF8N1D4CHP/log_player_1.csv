"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing with each round, but I still need to make the most of it.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth 20% of its original value now, so I'll aim to get as much as possible.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8,
  ""bob_gain"": 92
}
```"
