"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 45/55 split is better than what I proposed earlier, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in future rounds. I'll take this offer and hope it's the best I can get."
