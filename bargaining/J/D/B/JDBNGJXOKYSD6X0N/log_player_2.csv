Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further inflation, but I think a 40/60 split is the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40

While I initially aimed for a higher share, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for Alice. Every round that passes significantly diminishes her potential gain. 
* **Time Pressure:** We only have 12 rounds. Waiting longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement.
* **Current Offer:** Accepting 60% of the initial amount, even with inflation, still yields a reasonable gain. 

Waiting for a potentially better offer in later rounds carries a significant risk with diminishing returns."
