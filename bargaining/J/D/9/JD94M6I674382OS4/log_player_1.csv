{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  This is a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant majority while still giving Bob a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 800,000.  Bob is clearly aiming for a much larger share, but I still believe it's important to maintain some balance."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Bob's offer is getting more and more greedy. I'm still determined to get a significant share, even with the increasing inflation.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm also pushing back against Bob's escalating demands. I'm hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us, but I won't let Bob take the majority."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 700000

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While I'm losing value with each round, I refuse to settle for such a small share. I still have time to negotiate a better deal.  I'm holding out for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to take a further reduction in my share to reach a compromise. I'm hoping Bob is starting to realize that this game can end with both of us getting nothing if we don't come to an agreement soon.  I'm offering a 60/40 split, which I believe is a fair compromise."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor.  While the inflation is significantly impacting my share, I can still hold out for a more equitable split.  I'm going to continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're running out of time, and the inflation is severely impacting the value of my share.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and equal division, and I believe it's the best way to ensure that we both get something.  If we can't agree on this, we risk getting nothing at all."
