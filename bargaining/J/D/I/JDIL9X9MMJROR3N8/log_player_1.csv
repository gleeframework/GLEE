Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's split it evenly to start.  It's a fair offer and we can see how the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's less than I initially wanted, the inflation means that I'm effectively losing money by continuing.  It's better to take what I can get at this point."
