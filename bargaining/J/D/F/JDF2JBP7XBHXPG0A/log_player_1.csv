Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable, I propose I take $70 and you take $30.  The value will decrease if we wait longer. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
