"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While 100,000$ is a nice sum, it's worth considering that in the next round, Bob gets to make the offer, and the value of the money will decrease by 5%.  It's a risky move to accept this offer, as there's a chance to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll take 60% and you get 40%. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 40% is too low. Let's split it 55/45,  that's a better deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 55/45 split isn't ideal, it's better than the 40/60 split Alice offered in the previous round, and the value of the money is decreasing with each round.  Accepting ensures a decent amount of money, even with the inflation factor."
