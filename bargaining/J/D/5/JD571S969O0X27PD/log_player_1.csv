"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I want a bigger share for myself 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving away too much""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, with me getting $400,000 and Bob getting $600,000. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a bigger share and still getting a decent amount for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a big chunk, but you can have a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. The inflation has already taken a significant toll on my earnings, and Bob's offer is an insult. I'm not willing to accept a paltry $100,000 when I was hoping for a more substantial share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving away everything""}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, with me getting $300,000 and Bob getting $700,000. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and give him a bigger share, but I'm not willing to give away too much."
