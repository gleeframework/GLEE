"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a bit better than that.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor,  since I get to make the offer this round.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I don't think it's fair that Bob gets to make the offer this round and propose a 60-40 split in his favor, especially after he rejected my initial offer. I'll reject this proposal and make my next offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I think I can do better than that. You rejected my first offer, now it's my turn to make a better one.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now $9,000.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a free pass, Bob! I'm offering a slightly better deal than your last one. Don't think you can just dictate the terms.""
}
```"
