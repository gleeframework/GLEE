"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. If Bob accepts, we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's see if you accept this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, the actual amount I would gain is 50 * 0.95 = 47.5. 

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50-50 split. 

```
