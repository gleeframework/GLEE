"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we have a good starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50-50 split, which is fair considering the current situation. Let's move on to the next round!"
