I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, and I believe it gives Bob a good incentive to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to 55. Since Bob rejected my initial offer and offered a worse split for me, I need to show that I'm not afraid to push back a little. I'm still being relatively fair, considering the inflation, and this gives Bob a chance to avoid further rounds and potential further devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is worse than what I was hoping for, it's still better than the 40/60 split he offered previously, and I'm getting increasingly worried about inflation. The value of what I'd be getting is already more than halved, and I'm afraid that with further rounds, I might end up with nothing."
