Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll offer Alice a slightly smaller share, but hopefully it's still enough to convince her to accept.  Let's see what she thinks."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd like more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. This seems like a fair split, especially with inflation kicking in.  Let's take it."
