"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I think I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Bob's money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not as good for me as my previous offer, but it's a better deal than Bob's previous offer, and it's better than the initial offer I made.
