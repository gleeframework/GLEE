"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of the money. You can try to do better next round! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though my share is small, it's better than getting nothing in 12 rounds. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 40/60, with you getting the larger share. This ensures we both get something, and I'm hoping to avoid further rounds of negotiation and inflation.""}
