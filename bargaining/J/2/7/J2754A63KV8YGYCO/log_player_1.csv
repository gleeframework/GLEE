"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 200,000. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for my efforts.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
