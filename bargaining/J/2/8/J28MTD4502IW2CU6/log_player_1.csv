"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll get the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, considering we both need to share the money. Let's end this round and get our share. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to reassess the fairness of the offer.

Initially, Bob's offer was a 51/49 split, which is not very favorable to me. However, considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

* My gain: 49/0.8 = 61.25 (since my gain is worth 20% less)
* Bob's gain: 51/0.95 = 53.68 (since Bob's gain is worth 5% less)

This means that, in reality, I'm getting 61.25 and Bob is getting 53.68, which is still a slightly unfavorable split for me. However, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of my potential gain due to inflation.
