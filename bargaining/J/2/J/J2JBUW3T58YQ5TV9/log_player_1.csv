I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping most of the money for myself. Since the money is worth less to Bob in later rounds, I hope he'll accept this early offer and we can both get some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting a much better deal in this round. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've lowered my offer a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate. Bob's offer was too high, and the inflation hurts him more than me. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for him with each round due to the inflation.  Although I'd prefer more, I'm getting a decent amount and the rounds are running out.  Accepting ensures I get something before the money is worth nothing."
