"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a better split for us both. Let's be fair, and end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, especially after accounting for inflation.  While waiting carries risks, it's better to negotiate for a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer recognizes the time pressure but is still fair.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're approaching 1/3 of the total rounds. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Concession:**  I've moved closer to a 50/50 split, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Advantage:** This offer is still slightly in my favor, reflecting the fact that I'm more impacted by inflation."
