"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very uneven split! I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up 90% of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has already taken a toll, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here's my next proposal:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This way, I'm giving up a bit more of the initial amount, but still trying to get a decent share."
