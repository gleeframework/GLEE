"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $40, and I'll take $60. Let's finish the game here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can finish the game quickly. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting my slightly greater negotiating skills. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd actually be getting $54 (60 x 0.9).

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While I appreciate Bob's confidence in his negotiating skills, I'm not sure I'm ready to concede just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 81% of its original value now (90% of 90%), I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $45, and I'll take $55. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split.""
}
```"
