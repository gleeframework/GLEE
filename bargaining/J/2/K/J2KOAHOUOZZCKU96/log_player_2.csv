"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

""bob_gain"": 5500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer doesn't account for the rapid inflation impacting me. This offer is a compromise, slightly closer to your desired split while acknowledging the shrinking value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to leverage the inflation disparity to her advantage, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's important to remain firm and demonstrate that I understand the impact of inflation on both sides. Accepting this offer would set a bad precedent for future negotiations."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution quickly with the inflation working against us both. This offer is a fair compromise, acknowledging your need for a larger share due to the faster devaluation but also giving me a reasonable portion.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer makes a few strategic adjustments:

* **Slight Concession:**  Moving closer to a 50/50 split shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Urgency:** Highlighting the shrinking pot due to inflation encourages a quicker agreement. 
* **Justification:** Directly addressing Alice's concern about devaluation makes the offer seem more reasonable. 

Hopefully, this encourages Alice to accept, as further delays will significantly harm both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a critical point in our negotiation. I'm offering a split that acknowledges the increasing pressure of inflation on my end.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that we need to settle quickly, her offer still doesn't reflect the urgency of the situation. She's asking for a larger share than in her initial offer, taking advantage of the shrinking pot. Accepting this would be letting her dictate the terms despite the increasing pressure on both of us. I need to hold firm and offer a more balanced solution in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. We're running out of time, and the money is losing value rapidly for both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution in this situation. Let's end this now before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  It's crucial to communicate the seriousness of the situation and that this is a non-negotiable offer.
* **50/50 Split:**  Given the time pressure and rapidly decreasing value, a fair split is the most logical solution.  
* **Appeal to Logic and Mutual Benefit:** By emphasizing the shared risk of losing everything, Alice is more likely to accept. 

This approach aims to make Alice realize that further haggling is pointless and that accepting this offer is the best way to maximize her gains before the money loses even more value."
