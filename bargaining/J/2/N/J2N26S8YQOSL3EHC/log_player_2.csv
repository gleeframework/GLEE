"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm open to negotiation!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be more realistic. How about we split it a bit closer to even? This round, I propose I take a *slightly* larger share to make up for the first round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40 this round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to negotiate, but it's still heavily in her favor.  The longer we wait, the more the inflation hurts me. I need to push for a more even split soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth isn't getting us anywhere.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}"
