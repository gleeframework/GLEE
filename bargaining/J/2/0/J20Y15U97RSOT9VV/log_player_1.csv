Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive start. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share to get something at all, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, even with the inflation considered. It's a much better deal than risking another round and potentially getting nothing.  Let's take it!"
