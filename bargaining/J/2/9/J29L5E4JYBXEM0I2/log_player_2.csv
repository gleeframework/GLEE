"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try and get a better deal. Since I don't know about the inflation effect on Alice, I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair.  Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you all the money 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm going to accept this offer.  I know the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but Alice's money is losing value.  If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and we might end up with nothing."
