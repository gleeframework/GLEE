Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, Bob's offer of $45 is actually equivalent to $36 in the first round. Considering this, I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I'll reject it to try to get a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob while considering the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $48 and taking $52 for myself, with a message suggesting that we're meeting in the middle and taking into account the inflation that's affecting us both. Hopefully, Bob will find this offer more acceptable!"
