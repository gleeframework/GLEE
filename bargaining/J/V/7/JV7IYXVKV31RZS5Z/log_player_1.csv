"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. This is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 200,000 is better than nothing, it's a significant drop from my previous proposal. I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 600,000 - 400,000 split. This is a more balanced proposal that reflects the potential for further inflation. I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly lower than what I initially proposed, the inflation is taking its toll.  Accepting this offer will at least ensure I get something, and with further inflation, I might get nothing at all in the next round."
