Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced deal this time. This offer accounts for the time value of money with the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose out the longer this goes. Meet me in the middle - this offer is my final concession. 
# Alice gain: 540000 
# Bob gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in Round 4. The increasing impact of inflation on both our gains makes it sensible to conclude the negotiations here. Further rounds would only continue to devalue the money for both of us. Meeting in the middle as Bob suggests seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
