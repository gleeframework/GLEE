"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it evenly. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting since it's a 50/50 split, but the inflation is hurting him more than me. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round.
