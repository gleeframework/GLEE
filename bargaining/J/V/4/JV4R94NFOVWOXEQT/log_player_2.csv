Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
###\n\nI'll reject this offer. With the money being worth nearly 57% less to Alice, a 50/50 split would actually be a very uneven deal in her favor, considering the initial value of the money. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round!"
