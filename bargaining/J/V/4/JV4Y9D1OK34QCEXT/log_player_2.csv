Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting silly!  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now I'm being less generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point. While Alice may be getting less generous, Bob's bargaining power is steadily decreasing due to inflation. However, accepting $43 now, worth only 81.45% of its original value, is a poor outcome. 

Bob needs to convey the urgency. If Alice doesn't budge in the next round, he'll be forced to accept a worse offer or risk getting even less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous! The value is literally shrinking for me with every passing second. This offer is more than fair. Take it before we both lose out!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take advantage of that 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The jig is up.  Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanic and Bob's dwindling returns.  

* **Shrinking Value:**  $44 is now only worth 73.51% of its initial value to Bob. The longer the game goes on, the worse this gets.
* **Alice's Strategy:**  She's shown no willingness to negotiate fairly and is content to whittle Bob down.
* **Potential for Loss:** If Bob rejects this, Alice's next offer might be even worse, leaving him with a paltry sum.

This is a bitter pill to swallow, but dragging it out will likely only result in further losses for Bob."
