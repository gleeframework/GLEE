7000.0,3000.0,I propose we split the $10000 with a 70/30 ratio in favor of maximizing my share. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I propose we split the money 55/45 in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money and allows us both to get a good share.,Bob,2,
