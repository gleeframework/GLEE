"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 55/45 in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money and allows us both to get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
