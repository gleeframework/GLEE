"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll propose a division that slightly favors me to start negotiations but remains reasonable to encourage Bob to consider it. Given the impact of inflation, it's crucial to try and conclude the game as early as possible to maximize the value of the money. Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""A fair start, considering the inflation impact.""
}
```

### \nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This deal accounts for the rapid devaluation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains and the relatively minor impact on Bob's, I need to carefully consider the offer. However, accepting this offer early on might not be the best strategy since it heavily favors Bob. The difference in inflation rates between us means I have more to lose from prolonging negotiations, but accepting 400,000 in the second round might undervalue my position too early. Here's my response:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

### \nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a more balanced division considering the inflation rates. Please proceed to Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\nConsidering the rejection and the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'll adjust my proposal to make it more attractive to Bob while trying to maximize my gain. The goal is to find a balance that accounts for the devaluation without overly favoring Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""
}
```

### \nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice, and your share is shrinking fast. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 4\nGiven the severe impact of inflation on my potential gains and the fact that we are already in Round 4, I must reassess my strategy. The money's value is decreasing rapidly for me, and prolonging the game further might result in significantly less value for my share. Bob's offer of 450,000, although not ideal, starts to look more favorable considering the time pressure and the devaluation of the money. Here's my response:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

### \nAccepting this offer seems to be the most rational decision at this point, as further negotiations could lead to a worse outcome due to the inflation rate affecting my share more significantly than Bob's."
