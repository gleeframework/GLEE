Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a more balanced split. I'm proposing we each get $6000 and $4000 respectively. This takes into account the inflation and gives us both a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
