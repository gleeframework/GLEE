"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to take $99 and leave Bob with $1. It's a bit greedy, but this is a game of strategy, and I want to maximize my potential gains.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal considering the inflation. Accepting ensures I get something, and it's a good starting point for negotiations in future rounds if necessary."
