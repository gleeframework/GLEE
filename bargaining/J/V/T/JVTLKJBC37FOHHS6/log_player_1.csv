"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This is a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. This offer accounts for the inflation we're both facing. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to wear me down, but his offers haven't budged significantly. While the inflation is hurting, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would be letting Bob take advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Bob. This is a competitive offer considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly adjusting my offer downwards to signal some flexibility, but not by much. I need to convey the urgency of the situation due to the inflation while still aiming for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a fair compromise that takes inflation into account. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is simply mirroring my offers now and trying to present them as his own. This indicates he likely won't go higher unless he feels pressured.  The inflation is getting worse, but accepting now would mean settling for less than I believe I can get with some strategic negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the time pressure and inflation.  This ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move from his position, and I need to act decisively as inflation is eating into my potential gains. A 50/50 split, while not ideal, guarantees a reasonable payout in the face of a stubborn negotiator and the increasing pressure from inflation."
