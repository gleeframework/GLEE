Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm starting with an extremely lopsided offer to see if Bob is willing to risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money,  it's likely Bob will become increasingly more demanding in the future rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
