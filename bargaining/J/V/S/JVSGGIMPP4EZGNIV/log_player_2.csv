Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my offer is more generous than it seems 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. Inflation is hurting us both, and this way we can at least get something decent.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My share hasn't changed value, but yours has. This is my best offer yet 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is still not ideal, the inflation is seriously hurting Bob's potential gains. Accepting at this point secures something, even if it's a bit less than ideal."
