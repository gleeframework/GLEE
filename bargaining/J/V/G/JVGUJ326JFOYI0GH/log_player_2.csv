"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to give you a bit more than half. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a fair starting point, I'm going to try to get more. I know that the value of the money will decrease with each round, but I think I can get a better deal by holding out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, Alice.  But I think I can do better. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time.  Remember, the value of the money is decreasing with each round, so let's make a decision that benefits us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. The money is losing value quickly, so let's reach an agreement before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The money is losing value quickly, and while I'd still like to get more, I don't want to risk losing out on a significant portion of the potential gain. I'll accept Alice's offer."
