"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not splitting it evenly anymore! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll analyze Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 3:1 split. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give you all the money!""
}
```

I'm offering a 36-64 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial proposal. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm taking a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 1800 
# Bob gain: 8200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round.

I'll analyze Bob's new offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can still do better than a 2:8 split. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 64.91% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2800,
  ""bob_gain"": 7200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all my leverage!""
}
```

I'm offering a 28-72 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous proposals. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the last bit of leverage, it's now or never! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round.

I'll analyze Bob's final offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can still get a better deal. I'm not going to accept a 1:9 split, especially with the inflation effect reducing the value of my gain even further. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob, but I'm not sure if he'll make another one..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 54.61% of what it was in the first round.

However, I should note that I've already rejected Bob's previous offer, which was a 1:9 split, and I'm not sure if he'll make another one. Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a bold move:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 10000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going all-in, Bob. You get it all. I'm done.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob the entire $10,000, hoping he'll accept and end the game. It's a risk, but I'm not sure if I can get a better deal at this point."
