"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a 50/50 split, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering the offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept the 50/50 split. Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation. I'll make it up to you with a slightly larger share now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is mirroring my previous offer! Considering the significant drop in value due to inflation, I'll have to carefully consider this offer.

However, I'd rather get a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Since Bob is offering a slightly smaller share than I initially offered, I'll have to think strategically.

```

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the significant inflation.""

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is repeating himself again! Given the significant drop in value due to inflation, I'm starting to feel a bit desperate. However, I still want to maximize my share.

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob is offering a smaller share than my previous offer, I might have to consider accepting this one.
