"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, and Bob's offer is now:

# Alice gain: 40
# Bob gain: 48

I'll accept this offer.
