"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take the first 60, you can have the rest.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80, I'm thinking that I can do slightly better than that. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time, but I think we can find a better split than 80/20.""}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
