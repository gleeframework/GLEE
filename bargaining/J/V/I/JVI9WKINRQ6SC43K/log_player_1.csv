"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll take it in the first round. I figure he might be willing to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all, especially since the money won't be worth less to him in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though my share is only worth 10% less this round, Bob is taking 99.9% of the money.  I'll hold out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get more if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a bigger share this time.  He'll get 10% of the money, which is still a substantial amount. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, and that he'll accept before the inflation hits my share too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer again. Even though my share is now worth less than in the previous rounds, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm hoping that Bob will eventually realize that he can't keep taking such a large share of the money. If we go through many more rounds, his share of the money will likely remain the same, while mine will continue to decrease due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still holding out for the majority.  I'm hoping that by giving him a slightly larger share, he'll be more likely to accept and we can end the game before inflation eats away too much of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though my share is now worth less than in the previous rounds, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think Bob will eventually realize that he can't keep getting such a large share of the money. If we go through many more rounds, his share of the money will likely remain the same, while mine will continue to decrease due to inflation. I'm hoping that the pressure of the diminishing value of my share will push Bob to accept a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share again, hoping to find a compromise point. My share is declining rapidly due to inflation, so I need to find a balance between getting a decent amount and ending the game before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While my share is significantly smaller now, I'm still not willing to accept this. The trend is clear - Bob keeps offering me a smaller and smaller share, despite inflation hitting me hard.  I'm hoping that by refusing his offer, he'll see that I'm not desperate and will be willing to negotiate a more equitable deal.  I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out, but I'm still determined to get a fairer share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share again, but I'm still trying to secure a majority. Inflation is really hurting my share now, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I need to find a balance between getting a decent amount and ending the game before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 343900 
# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  I know my share is dropping rapidly, but I'm not giving in yet.  If I accept this, Bob will know that he can just keep offering me less and less with every round. I'm hoping that by holding out for a better deal, I can get him to see that I'm not desperate and that we need to find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 590490, ""bob_gain"": 409510}
```

This is getting really close to the end! I'm offering Bob a significant share, hoping he'll realize that we both need to compromise to get anything at all.  I'm not sure if it will be enough, but it's the best chance I have left to get a decent amount before inflation wipes out my entire share."
