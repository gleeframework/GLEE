"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. I'll take 4000, and you can have 6000. It's a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
