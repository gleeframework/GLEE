"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to find a balance where Bob will still accept the offer before the value of the money decreases further for him. The message ""Let's be fair!"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the proposal early on, ensuring we both get a share without risking the devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for drama! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait for a potentially better offer or try to negotiate a better split in my favor. Accepting an even split now might be premature, given that Bob is under more pressure due to the devaluation of his potential gain over time. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to leverage Bob's increasing urgency as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases for him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, this is fair.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a slightly better deal to Bob compared to my initial offer, but still not as favorable as his even split proposal. Given that the money is worth less to Bob now due to inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that acknowledges his loss but still benefits me, as the value of the money remains constant for me. The message aims to reason with Bob, highlighting that my offer is a compromise considering his devaluing share, in hopes that he will accept before the money loses even more value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's willingness to compromise, the split is still not as favorable to me as I believe I can achieve. Since the money continues to devalue for Bob with each round, I anticipate that he will become increasingly desperate to reach an agreement. This desperation could lead to him accepting a less favorable split in the future. Given that the value of the money remains constant for me, I can afford to wait and see if Bob will accept a deal that benefits me more in the subsequent rounds. By rejecting this offer, I aim to apply pressure on Bob, leveraging the impact of inflation on his potential gain to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my previous one, acknowledging the increasing pressure he's under due to the devaluation of his potential gain. However, the offer still leans in my favor, as I'm trying to maximize my share while considering Bob's growing urgency. The message aims to emphasize the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement now, highlighting the risk of further losses for Bob if we fail to settle. By framing the offer as a compromise, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's rationality and desire to minimize his losses, encouraging him to accept this proposal.\n### {""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Let's settle before it's too late.""}"
