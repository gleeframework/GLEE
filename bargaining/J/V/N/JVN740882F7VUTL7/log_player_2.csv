Let's see what Alice proposes next.  I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split right off the bat.  There's plenty of time to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly more even split. I want to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice has upped her offer to a 55/45 split, and even though she's getting a bigger portion, the inflation means it's worth less to her.  I'm willing to take this deal.  It's better than what I was originally offered, and there's always a chance that I could get a better deal later on, but I'm not going to push my luck too much.  It's a win-win situation."
