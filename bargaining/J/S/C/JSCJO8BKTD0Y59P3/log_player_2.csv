Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 2000 for me and 8000 for her, and I rejected it, I'll try to do better.

{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to adjust my strategy.

In round 2, I offered 2500, which is 25% of 10,000. In round 3, the money is worth 36% less, so I'll offer 25% of the reduced amount.

However, I'll accept Alice's offer since it's better than my calculated offer.
