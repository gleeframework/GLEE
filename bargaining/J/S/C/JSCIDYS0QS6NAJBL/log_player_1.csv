Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide the money with a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 75$, you get 25$. It's fair considering the decreasing value of money in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 40, you take 60. It's a fair split considering the decreasing value of money, and I think we can both agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
