"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split to see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to counter 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take a larger share, but I'm not budging yet. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and keeping my expectations high. Let's see if he'll come back with a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly larger share. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if Bob will accept a slightly more favorable split for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is still trying to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to my target, but I still want a slightly better deal. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as it's still not quite to my liking. I'm hoping he'll come back with an even better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a slight concession to get closer to a deal. Can we meet in the middle now?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where both of us can agree, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to get there."
