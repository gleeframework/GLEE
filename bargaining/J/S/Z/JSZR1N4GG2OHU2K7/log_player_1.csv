Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000.  I figure I'll keep the majority of the money, as I'm the one making the proposal. Hopefully, he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take half now than risk getting nothing in the next round. Inflation might mean Bob gets a better deal, but I'm not willing to gamble."
