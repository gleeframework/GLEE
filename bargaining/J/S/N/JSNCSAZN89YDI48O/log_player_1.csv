"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll keep the rest. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise. You get a good share, and I get a bit more than your initial offer. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4,000 is worth 95% of the original $8,000 I proposed in Round 1, which is $7,600. And Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of the original $7,500 he proposed in his offer, which is $6,000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.
