"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the money is now worth 20% less. Let's come to an agreement before it devalues further!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both lose money with each round, so let's end this before we lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI think splitting it evenly is a fair offer, especially considering the money is worth less with each passing round. It's better to accept this offer and end the game before the money devalues further, rather than risking another round and potentially losing even more value."
