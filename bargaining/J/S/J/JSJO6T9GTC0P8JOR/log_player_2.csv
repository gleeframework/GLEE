# Alice gain: 6200

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant chunk of the initial amount due to inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it's just slightly better."

# Alice's message: I'm not backing down, you're losing value fast 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is getting dangerous, but accepting this offer would mean getting even less than before.  There's still a chance Alice will panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer a more significant amount.  I have to gamble."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. This is a slight bump from your last offer, but it's the best you'll get.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and while I'm gambling on Alice getting nervous, I need to show some willingness to compromise. Offering slightly more than her last offer might be enough to entice her while still giving me a decent amount considering the inflation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of options, take this or risk losing more 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough pill to swallow, but it's becoming too risky.  With only three rounds left, and the inflation eating away at my potential gains, waiting any longer could result in an even worse outcome. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, which is better than walking away with nothing."
