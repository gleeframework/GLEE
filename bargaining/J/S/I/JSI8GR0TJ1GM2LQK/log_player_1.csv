"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

```
