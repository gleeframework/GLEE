"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40$ is now worth 38$ (95% of 40$).

I'm not thrilled about the unequal split, but I'll consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
