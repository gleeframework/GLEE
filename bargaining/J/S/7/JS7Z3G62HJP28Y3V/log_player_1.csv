"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lesser amount this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,500 is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 55-45 split, but I think it's a slightly better offer than my initial proposal. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
