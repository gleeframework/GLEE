"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive 800,000 dollars and Bob receives 200,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 100,000 dollars in this round is worth 80,000 dollars, which is 10% of the original 800,000 dollars I proposed in the first round. This is a very favorable offer for Bob.

I will reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 64% of the original amount (80% of 80% of the original), I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the cumulative inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50,000 dollars in this round is worth 26,400 dollars, which is 2.64% of the original 1,000,000 dollars. This is a very low percentage, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

However, considering that this is a relatively small amount of money, I'll think about the opportunity cost of rejecting this offer. If I reject, I'll have to make another proposal, and the money will be worth even less due to further inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
