750000.0,250000.0,I propose dividing the money into 750000 for me and 250000 for you. This ensures we both benefit from the initial division.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.  Let's both get a decent share before the money loses more value.,Bob,2,
