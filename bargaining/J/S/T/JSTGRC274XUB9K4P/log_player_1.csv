Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.  Let's both get a decent share before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
