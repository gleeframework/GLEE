"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, I, Alice, am offering to take $600,000 (60% of the total amount), leaving Bob with $400,000 (40% of the total amount). I'm framing this as a ""fair"" division, hoping that Bob will perceive the 60-40 split as reasonable and be inclined to accept, thus ending the game in the first round. This approach aims to take advantage of psychological factors, as Bob might be more likely to accept a proposal framed as fair rather than pushing for further negotiations, especially considering the looming threat of inflation that disproportionately affects his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time.  Fair is fair, after all. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because accepting it would mean I end up with $400,000, which is less than what I initially offered to take ($600,000). Given that the value of the money for me hasn't changed due to inflation, and considering the significant reduction in what I would gain, it's logical for me to reject this proposal and proceed to the next round. There, I'll have the opportunity to make a new offer that could potentially be more favorable to me, especially since Bob is under pressure due to the devaluing of his potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my share to $700,000 and decreasing Bob's share to $300,000. Given that the money's value for Bob has decreased by 20% due to inflation, and this trend will continue, my offer still presents a significant value to Bob compared to further rounds. By framing this as ""more than fair,"" I'm leveraging the psychological impact of the decreasing value of Bob's potential gains, aiming to persuade him that accepting this offer is in his best interest rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to turn the tables. This time, I'm taking 70% and leaving you with 30%. Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the increasing pressure of inflation on Bob's potential gains, accepting 30% of the original amount ($300,000) is significantly less than my initial offer and even less than what I offered in the previous round. Given that the value of the money for me remains unchanged, it's strategic for me to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. This decision is based on the expectation that the continued devaluation of Bob's share might make him more inclined to accept a slightly more favorable offer in the next round, rather than risking further loss of value.\n###\n\nMoreover, accepting such a low offer after having made higher offers myself would be strategically weak, as it would indicate a willingness to settle for significantly less without exhausting all negotiation possibilities. Proceeding to the next round allows me to maintain negotiation pressure and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation, this is your best option""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my share to $750,000 and decreasing Bob's share to $250,000. Given the cumulative effect of inflation, which has reduced the value of Bob's potential gains by 48.8% since the first round, this offer still presents a tangible value to Bob. By emphasizing that this is his ""best option,"" I'm aiming to persuade Bob that, due to the ongoing devaluation of his share, accepting this offer is preferable to risking further negotiations. This approach seeks to capitalize on the psychological effect of the diminishing value of Bob's share, encouraging him to secure a certain amount now rather than gamble on potentially worse outcomes in subsequent rounds."
