Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's start with a good split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would get $60 and Bob would get $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think splitting the money evenly is a bad idea, but I was hoping for a slightly better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I would get $55 and Bob would get $45. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still beneficial for me, but also acknowledges Bob's desire for a fair split."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm starting to feel like Bob is getting the better end of the deal, and I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split. I was hoping to get a slightly better deal, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
