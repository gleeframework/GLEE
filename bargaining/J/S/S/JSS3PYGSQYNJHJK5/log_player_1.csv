"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of 300,000$ is actually worth 285,000$ and Bob's gain of 700,000$ is worth 560,000$. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and the risk of getting less in the next round.
