"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer gives you a fair share considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see how Alice responds to my counteroffer.  The inflation will work in my favor if we keep going."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly, Alice. I'm willing to accept a lower share now, but we both need to be fair if we want to avoid losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking. I'm being generous, but this is my final offer before I have to significantly reduce my share to account for the inflation hitting you. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still being very greedy.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still in a better position to negotiate a fairer deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with each round. Let's be realistic and split the money more fairly.  I'm willing to give you a majority, but we need to find a compromise that works for both of us.""}
