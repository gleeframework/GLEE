Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 60 dollars and Bob will take 40 dollars."

# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
