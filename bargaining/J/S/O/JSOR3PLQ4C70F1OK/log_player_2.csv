"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your split was unfair to me. I'm proposing a revised split that accounts for the time value of money. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  The money is devaluating faster for Bob (20% per round) than Alice (10% per round). It's crucial to get a larger share quickly.
* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is Bob's final offer, it creates a sense of urgency and may push Alice to accept.  Delaying further significantly hurts Bob's potential gain.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While the offer is tilted in Bob's favor, it's not outrageously so. This might make it more palatable for Alice than an extremely one-sided proposal. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Alice will reject this offer. If she does, Bob needs to be prepared to accept a much less favorable deal in a later round, or risk getting nothing at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my patience is wearing thin. This is a one-time compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less money there is to be gained. Waiting for a better offer is incredibly risky now. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message suggests she's becoming less willing to compromise.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While not ideal, accepting 4200 is better than risking getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing at all, if the game continues and Alice becomes even more demanding."
