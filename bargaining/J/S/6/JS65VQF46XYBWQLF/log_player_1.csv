"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose that Alice gets $999,999 and Bob gets $1. This is a very lopsided offer, but it's a good starting point for the game.  It sets the stage for potential negotiation and leaves room for Bob to either accept a slight increase or propose his own offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob's gains. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, which is a reasonable outcome.  It's better than risking a further negotiation and potentially getting less in subsequent rounds."
