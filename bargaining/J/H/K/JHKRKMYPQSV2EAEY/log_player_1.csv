# Bob's message: I'm not going to accept anything, I'll take nothing instead! 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Well, I guess Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to accept any offer that doesn't give him a significant share. I'll accept his offer, as I'd rather take the entire amount than leave it all behind.
