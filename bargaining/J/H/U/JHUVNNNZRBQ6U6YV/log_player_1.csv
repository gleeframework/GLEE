"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced offer, considering the risks and the potential for inflation. Your gain is still significant, but not as skewed as before. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
