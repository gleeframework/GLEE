"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's a good deal for him considering inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Inflation will continue to erode the value of the money, and a 50/50 split is fair considering that. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
