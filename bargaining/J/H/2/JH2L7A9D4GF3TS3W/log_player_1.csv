"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, leaving the door open for Bob to make his next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain this round is worth 5% less than the $5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's $4750.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a smaller share now against the risk of getting an even smaller share in future rounds.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money I gain this round is worth 5% less than the $4750 I would have gotten in the second round, so it's $4525.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a slightly larger share is fair considering inflation. Let's settle this! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really starting to bite! The money I gain this round is worth 14.26% less than the $5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's $4301.74.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling money. I'll decide to accept this offer.
