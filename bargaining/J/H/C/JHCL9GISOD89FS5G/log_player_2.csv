"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly. This offer benefits you greatly considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's a significant gain for Bob, it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further in future rounds. The inflation hurts Alice more than Bob, so there's potential for a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This offer is fair, considering the inflation. What do you say?""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This is my final offer before the inflation significantly impacts the value.  
# Bob gain: 180000 
# Alice gain: 820000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy at this point.  The inflation will significantly impact Alice's gains in the next round, making it less likely she'll offer a better deal.  This offer gives me a decent share, and it's more likely to be accepted than a counter-offer."
