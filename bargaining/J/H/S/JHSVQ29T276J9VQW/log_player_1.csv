"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
