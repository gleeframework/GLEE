"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1 in your favor to start, but I'm willing to negotiate!""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll gain in this round. I'll gain 60 * 0.9 = 54 dollars, and Bob will gain 40 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
