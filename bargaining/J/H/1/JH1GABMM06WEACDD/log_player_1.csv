"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

I don't like the fact that Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll reject his offer and try to do better next time.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreasing value of the money I gain, I'll have to be careful not to give away too much. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'll think about it...

I'll reject his offer and try to do better next time.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the continued inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and another 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for an even larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to accept Bob's offer to avoid losing even more value. I'll take what I can get.
