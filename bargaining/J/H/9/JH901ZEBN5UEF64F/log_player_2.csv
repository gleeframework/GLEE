"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Alice's share loses value much faster than Bob's due to the higher inflation rate she faces.  This puts pressure on her to reach an agreement sooner.
* **Stronger Position:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob signals he's not desperate and aims for a larger share.
* **Appearance of Fairness:**  Offering slightly more than half could be perceived as ""generous"" by Alice, potentially making her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time, Bob. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both players, but especially to Alice. While a 55/45 split was ideal, it's no longer realistic. 
* **Fair Offer:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. Holding out for more risks Alice making an even less favorable offer in a later round.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable share.  Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in later rounds is very risky given the rapid devaluation of the money."
