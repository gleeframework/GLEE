Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I also need to get a fair amount.  Let's split it 55/45, which still accounts for your faster rate of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
