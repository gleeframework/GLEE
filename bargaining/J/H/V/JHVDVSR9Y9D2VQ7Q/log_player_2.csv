"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will hurt you more than me. Let's get this done!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. I'll compromise a bit, but 58-42 is as low as I'll go for now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, I think it's wise to accept this offer. Inflation is hurting Alice more, and if I keep rejecting, we risk getting nothing."
