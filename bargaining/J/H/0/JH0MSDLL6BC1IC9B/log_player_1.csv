"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can have 60, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll think for a moment...

I'm not sure I want to give up 60% of the remaining value of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you can have 40, it's a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
