"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me. I was hoping for a better split, and 30% is still a bit low for me. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next one!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bit more""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving some room for Bob to get a decent share. Let's see if he's willing to accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Hmm, this offer is getting closer to what I was hoping for! 80% is a decent share, and I think I can live with 20% for Bob. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is getting desperate, I'll accept this offer and end the game."
