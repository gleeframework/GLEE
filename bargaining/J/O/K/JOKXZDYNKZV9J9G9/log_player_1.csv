"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, no hard feelings! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000 / 0.8 = $6,250
* Bob gain: $5,000 / 0.8 = $6,250

I accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
