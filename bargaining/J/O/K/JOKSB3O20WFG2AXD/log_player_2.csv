"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob! Take this small portion and let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I lose money to inflation faster than Alice, there's no way I'm accepting such a small amount in the first round.  We have plenty of time to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer gives us both a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time, I'm offering you a fair share, Bob. Let's end this quickly before we both lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's idea of ""fair"" still heavily favors her.  She's clearly feeling the inflation pressure more than I am, but I can hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""The tables have turned, Alice.  This is my counter-offer. Let's wrap this up.""}
```"
