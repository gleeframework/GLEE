"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be reasonable. This offer is closer to a 60/40 split, which I believe is fairer. You'll have a chance to propose again, so let's make some progress. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on her gains. I need to push for a more equitable distribution."
