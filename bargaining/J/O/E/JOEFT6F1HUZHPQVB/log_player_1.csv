"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to get a good start and set the tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to be strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 60/40 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for Round 3 to make my next move!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 60/40 split? I'll give you 55/45, but I'm not going lower!""
}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but still keep a slight edge. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
