"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob is being a bit too generous, and I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This split is more in line with what I think is fair.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
