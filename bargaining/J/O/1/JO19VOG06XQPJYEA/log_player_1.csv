Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly.  I'll take 95 and offer Bob 5.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with the inflation factor, accepting Bob's offer is the best option. 40 dollars now is better than potentially getting less if we keep rejecting offers and the money keeps depreciating."
