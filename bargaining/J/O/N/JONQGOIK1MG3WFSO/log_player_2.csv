"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate will hurt Alice more than me in the long run. I'm hoping to get a better deal by making a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate impacts us differently. This way, we both get a good share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is slightly better than mine was in round 2, and with inflation continuing, my share will shrink even further in the next round. It's best to take this offer and end the game."
