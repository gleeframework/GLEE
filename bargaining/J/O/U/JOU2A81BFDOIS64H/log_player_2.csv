Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take a small hit and agree to 55/45 in my favor. It's still a better deal for you than if we wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
