"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, Bob is offering me $60, but he wants to keep $40 for himself. This means that, in effect, he's offering me $60, but the money I gain is still worth the same as in the previous round, while the money he gains is worth 10% less.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not acceptable, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a big chunk, but I need something for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is taking a toll!

In round 4, Bob is offering me $70, but he wants to keep $30 for himself. Considering the value of the money has decreased for Bob due to inflation, this offer seems more reasonable.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
