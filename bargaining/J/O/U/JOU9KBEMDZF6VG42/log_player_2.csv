"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair deal, Bob. Take 10%, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair in the first round, I'm hoping for a better deal later.  I want to see what Alice will offer in the next round, especially considering the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you a fair share, and we can both get a decent amount. We have limited time, and I'm sure we can work something out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair. I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a solution that benefits both of us. This offer is a step closer to that. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer.  While I still think I could get more, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  This seems like a good compromise."
