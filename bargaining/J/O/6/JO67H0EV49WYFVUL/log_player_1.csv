Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I think this is more representative of the opportunity cost for both of us as the game goes on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, Bob, but this needs to be fair for both of us. This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This is the last round where an agreement makes us both better off than if we just walk away.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is right. This is the last round where we both gain more from an agreement than walking away.  Here's why:

* **My Losses:** Inflation is eating into my potential gains. If I reject this offer, the most I could gain in the next round (even with an ideal offer) is further reduced by inflation.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows I'm incentivized to take a deal now to avoid further losses from inflation. He's unlikely to offer more.

A 50/50 split isn't ideal, but waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse outcome for me."
