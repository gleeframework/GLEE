Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, you win. This is getting too risky. Let's just end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is the best deal I'm going to get. The fact that Alice is essentially admitting defeat and wants to end the game before it's too late suggests that she's not willing to go much further. Given the current state of inflation, I'd rather take this offer than risk losing out on more value in future rounds. It's time to take the money and run!"
