  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

  ""message"": ""Let's split the funds with a 7:3 ratio. This ensures both parties receive a fair share while considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I understand the money depreciates faster for you, I believe this offer is still fair given the potential for even greater losses in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
