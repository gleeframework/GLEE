I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave Bob with 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try and get a slightly bigger share this round. I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars. While this is less than his previous offer, it's still a significant amount, and it's important to remember that the money is losing value with each passing round."
