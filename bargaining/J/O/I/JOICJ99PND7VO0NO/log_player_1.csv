Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the decreasing value of money!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 55% is still a bit too high for me, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
