"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice proposes next.  I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly this time. It's better for both of us to get something than risk losing it all.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, last offer was too low 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the safest choice. The money is losing value rapidly, and risking further rounds could result in both of us getting nothing."
