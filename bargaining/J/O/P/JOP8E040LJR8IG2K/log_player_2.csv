# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to claw back some gains. However, she's still aiming for a larger share than I offered in the previous round. While the clock is ticking, I'm holding on for a slightly better deal, knowing the inflation works heavily in my favor with each passing round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 512500,
""alice_gain"": 487500,
""message"": ""Alice, I see your point. Let's compromise â€“ I'm adjusting my offer slightly closer to yours. Time is ticking, let's close the deal and avoid losing out completely."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm inching closer to a 50/50 split, acknowledging the time pressure while still leveraging the inflation working in my favor. This offer represents a small concession on my part, aiming to entice Alice into accepting a deal before her share diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the compromise. This is a slight adjustment to reflect the time pressure and its impact on my share. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very close to my last offer and is clearly feeling the pressure of the rapidly devaluing money. While I could potentially squeeze a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the risk of Alice becoming completely demoralized and refusing to negotiate further is too high. It's better to secure a win now than risk getting nothing at all later."
