"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer significantly favors Alice. While getting something is better than nothing, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more equitable split, Alice. This offer considers the time pressure and ensures we both benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is my final compromise, considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting more aggressive, but this offer is still unacceptable.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm willing to take a risk to avoid getting less than 40% of the initial amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. Let's end this with a perfectly fair 50/50 split. This is my final offer.""}
