"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**My reasoning:**

I'm going to start with a generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion. This is because I want to see if he's willing to accept a fair offer in the first round. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy for the next round, taking into account the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the exact opposite of my offer in round 1, but with the inflation factor, it's actually worse for me. While my initial offer was generous, his counter-offer is extremely unfair given the inflation. I'm better off continuing the game and hoping for a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Inflation:** I've factored in the 20% inflation from round 1, meaning my desired share is now 720,000 (80% of 900,000).
- **Previous Offer:**  Bob's previous offer was clearly designed to be unfair, but I'm willing to still propose a split that favors me slightly. 
- **Strategic Balance:**  I don't want to be too aggressive and risk Bob rejecting the offer again. This proposal should be enticing enough to encourage acceptance, but still allows room for negotiation if he's feeling stubborn."
