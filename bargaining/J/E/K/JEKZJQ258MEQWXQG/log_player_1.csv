"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start losing value to inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less and less with each passing round, I'd like to get a larger share now. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round for me, and 10% less than in the first round for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting!

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll have to think strategically. Since Bob is offering a larger share now, I'll accept this offer.
