Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm not sure why you rejected my previous offer, but I'm willing to split it more evenly.  This is my best offer, let's see if you're willing to play ball.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, given the inflation, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  It's better than the previous round and the chance of doing better in the future is small given the continued inflation."
