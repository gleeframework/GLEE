This is a tough one!  While not ideal, it's getting dangerous. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Severe Inflation:** I'm losing almost 60% of the value already. Each additional round makes a HUGE difference.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  She seems set on getting more than half. Waiting might not yield a better offer.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If I reject, and she offers even less next round (risky, but possible), I'm in a worse position. 

It's a gamble, but waiting could mean getting even less in real terms."
