"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the money evenly, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid any further negotiation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now getting $400,000.

I don't think I'm being too generous, and Bob's offer is quite aggressive. I'd rather not accept this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 60/40 is a bit steep for me""

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer and risk getting even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
