"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer last time, now it's my turn to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, and I'm hoping to do better in the next round. I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm looking for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try 45-55 this time!""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 45-55 split, hoping that Bob will find it more appealing this time around."
