"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  It's a significant offer considering there's still a lot of time left in the game and I am willing to take the risk of inflation affecting my share more in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is much less favorable to me, especially since the value of my share has decreased due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm willing to reduce my share slightly, but I believe this is still a fair offer. I'm hoping Bob will realize that if he rejects this offer, we're both risking a lot due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer from Bob is higher than in the previous round, the value of my share is significantly lower due to inflation. I'm not willing to accept this deal yet. I will continue negotiating for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm further reducing my share, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Bob is losing out on value due to inflation, and I believe he'll recognize the need to come to an agreement soon."
