"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, Alice.  I figure I should get the bigger share since I'm the one making the first offer.  What do you say, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm still hoping for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise a little.  This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still fairer than Bob's previous offer.  Let's see if we can agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}
```

I'm starting to get a little worried about the inflation, but I'm still holding out for a decent share. This offer gives Bob a bit more than before, but it still gives me the majority.  Let's see if he's willing to work with me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal!  Even with the inflation, I think I can get a bigger share if we keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 47, ""bob_gain"": 53}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm not ready to give up completely. This offer is a significant compromise, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but it's the best I can do without risking getting nothing at all."
