Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but that's not agreeable to me. Let's be pragmatic - I propose 60/40 in my favor.  This is a good deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
