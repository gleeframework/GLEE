{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. How about a 65/35 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 45/55 in my favor. This is a fairer deal considering the inflation, and it gives us both a chance to get something out of this. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000
