"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount for now, and we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $45 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly, especially since I had initially proposed a 80-20 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of $45 is now worth 90% of that, which is $40.50 in the first round's value.

I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach, offering Bob a smaller share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split.  I'm willing to be more flexible than you in the past, but I need a larger share to make this worth it for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! My gain of $55 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is approximately $38.05 in the first round's value.

Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a significant concession from his previous 50-50 offer. I'm not sure if I want to give him such a large share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively good deal considering the inflation.
