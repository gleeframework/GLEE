I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest and most likely to be accepted in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower amount than he offered me, but still a decent share.  Since I'm the one proposing, I want to get closer to the 50/50 split I initially suggested."
