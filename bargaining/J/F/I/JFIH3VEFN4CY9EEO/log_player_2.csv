"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'm affected by inflation more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems reasonable, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  The inflation rate is a significant factor and with 12 rounds to go, there's potential for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your initial proposal. Since inflation affects us differently, let's aim for a more balanced split. I believe this offer is fair and allows for a better outcome for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating our money. I'm offering you a larger share than your last offer, but I need you to be realistic about the impact of inflation on my side. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While Alice's offer is a bit higher than my previous offer, I still believe there's room for negotiation. The inflation rate is hitting Alice harder, but my offer in round 2 was a fair starting point. I'm confident we can find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round.  I'm willing to compromise and split the money evenly. Let's be realistic, a 50/50 split is the fairest way to minimize our losses given the current inflation rates.""
