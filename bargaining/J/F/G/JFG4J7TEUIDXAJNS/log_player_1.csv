"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split, which is closer to the original 50-50 split, but still slightly favoring me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll take a closer look at this offer. Since the 45-55 split is similar to the previous offer, but with a greater disparity due to inflation, I'll decide to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to take a more aggressive approach this time, considering the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain. I'll offer a 60-40 split, which might be more favorable to me, but also risks leaving Bob with a smaller share.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more severely, I'll take a closer look at this offer. A 42-58 split is still not in my favor, but it's closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer. Considering the significant inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.
