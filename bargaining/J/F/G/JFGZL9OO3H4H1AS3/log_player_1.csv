"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share this time. Since we both lose value with each round, let's try to get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While he's right about the money losing value, accepting a worse deal just because it's round 2 isn't in my best interest. I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. This delay is hurting both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's still in your favor considering the inflation, and it saves us both from further losses.""
