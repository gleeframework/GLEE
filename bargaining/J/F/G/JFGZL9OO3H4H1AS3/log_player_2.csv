Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. This delay is hurting both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's still in your favor considering the inflation, and it saves us both from further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
