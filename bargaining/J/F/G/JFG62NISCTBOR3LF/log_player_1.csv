**Reasoning:**

At this stage, Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation situation.  It's crucial to set a firm boundary.  While accepting Bob's previous offer (30/70) would still technically give Alice something, it sets a dangerous precedent for future negotiations. 

Offering 40/60 is a final attempt to reach a somewhat reasonable agreement. It signals to Bob that Alice understands the situation's dynamics but isn't willing to be completely taken advantage of. If Bob rejects this, Alice might need to consider accepting any future offer that's better than a 70/30 split in Bob's favor, even if it means accepting a significant loss."
