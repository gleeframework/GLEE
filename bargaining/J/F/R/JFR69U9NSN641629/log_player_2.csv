Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding out for a more equitable split. How about 53/47? 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the gap is closing, time is running out.  It's getting riskier to hold out for a better deal as inflation eats into my potential gains. However, I still have some leverage, and accepting 47 now would be a significant loss compared to my initial goal.  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise, but not capitulate."
