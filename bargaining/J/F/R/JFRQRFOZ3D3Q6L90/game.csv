51.0,49.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  The money will be worth less next round anyway.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,I think we can both do better. Let's split the money evenly this time. It's only a matter of time before inflation hurts us both if we keep going back and forth.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
