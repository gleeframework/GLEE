"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

My gain of 300,000 is now worth 60% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 700,000 is now worth 70% of what it was in the first round.

Considering this, I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, with us both getting equal shares of the remaining $1,000,000."
