"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 400,000 x 0.8 = 320,000
* Bob gain: 600,000 x 0.8 = 480,000

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the scraps! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less, so the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 300,000 x 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 154,880
* Bob gain: 700,000 x 0.516 = 360,520

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's a very uneven split. I'd rather wait for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it a tie, Bob. 50/50 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
