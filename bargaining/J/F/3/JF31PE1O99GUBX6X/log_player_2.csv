"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total value of the money is now 900,000 for me and 950,000 for Alice.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the new values, my offer is worth 19% less than the initial $1,000,000, which is $810,000, and Alice's offer is worth 9.75% less, which is $909,500.

My gain in Alice's offer is $480,000, which is more than my gain in my own offer ($550,000 - 19% = $442,500). I should accept Alice's offer.
