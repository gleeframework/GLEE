Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split that benefits us both.  Let's discuss it further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share.  Let's find a split that works for both of us, before we lose even more money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to stall, knowing that inflation works in his favor. He's mirroring our earlier offers, hoping we'll panic and accept a worse deal as the rounds progress. We need to be firm and show him we're serious about getting a fair share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a final offer. It's more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We are nearing the halfway point and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's time to apply more pressure. 
* **Show firmness:** Offering a slight concession shows we're willing to negotiate, but the ""take it or leave it"" message emphasizes that we're serious about getting a decent deal.  
* **Balancing act:**  We still need to offer something that appears reasonable to Bob, otherwise, he'll just wait us out, knowing the inflation is hurting us more than him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm confident we can find a better deal that benefits us both. We need to consider the time crunch and inflation but also be fair to each other. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing a waiting game. He's mirroring our offers, hoping we'll panic as time runs out and inflation eats into our potential gains. We need to hold strong and call his bluff.  He's not offered anything genuinely new, and accepting now would reward his stalling tactics."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option left. Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Force a decision:**  Bob is clearly content to let inflation erode our position.  A 50/50 split is the most straightforward, unambiguous offer, forcing him to either accept a fair deal or reveal that he's not negotiating in good faith.
* **Avoid appearing greedy:**  While we've been aiming for a 60/40 split, clinging to that now might make us seem unreasonable and unwilling to compromise.  A 50/50 split highlights the urgency of the situation and puts the onus on Bob to either agree or be seen as the obstacle.
* **Time sensitivity:** We're past the halfway point.  While we're holding strong, the inflation is becoming a serious factor. We need to resolve this quickly, and a 50/50 split offers the highest chance of immediate acceptance."
