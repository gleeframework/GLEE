"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a very small amount. I'm hoping he'll be desperate enough to accept it, especially since he'll have the chance to propose a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
