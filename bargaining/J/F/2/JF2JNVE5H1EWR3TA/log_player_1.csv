I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, considering I'm the one making the initial proposal and the risk of the money decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Since we both rejected the initial proposals, it's time to be more reasonable and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
