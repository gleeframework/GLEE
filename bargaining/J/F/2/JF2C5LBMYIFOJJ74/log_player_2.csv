Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation.  I need to remain firm to get a reasonable deal."

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this before I take it all 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough spot. I need to acknowledge that:

* **Alice is being ruthless:** She's clearly exploiting the inflation and my diminishing returns. 
* **Time is running out:**  Every round makes the potential gains worse for me.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this, she might actually offer me nothing in the next round, and I'll be forced to accept due to the game mechanics.

While $40 is much lower than I'd like, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
