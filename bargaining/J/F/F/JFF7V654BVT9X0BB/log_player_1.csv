"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  This seems fair, considering I'm taking the risk of making the first offer.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I would get $100,000, it's worth less due to inflation. I'm willing to wait another round and make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'll offer Bob 20% of the money.  It's less than what he offered me, but I'm trying to be reasonable.  I believe this is a fair compromise, especially since my offer is worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than the previous round, the value of my share is diminishing rapidly due to inflation. I need to make a counter offer and try to get a bigger portion."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 30% of the money.  Inflation is hurting me badly, but I need to secure a deal.  I'm hoping this offer is good enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still can't accept Bob's offer. Inflation is making my share worth less and less each round, and I need to try to get a larger portion. While it's tempting to take something now, I'm hoping I can negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money. Inflation is eating away at the value of my share, so I need to try and secure an agreement quickly. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, as the value of his share is also decreasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's better than the last round, the value of my share is decreasing significantly due to inflation.  I'm hoping that with more rounds passing, Bob will be more willing to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With inflation hitting us both hard, I think this is the fairest way to divide the remaining money.  We both get an equal share, and we can avoid further losses."
