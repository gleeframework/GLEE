"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60-40 split. It's a fairer starting point and allows for room to negotiate in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 32 (80% of 40).

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but it's a decent offer. I'll accept it to move on to the next round.
