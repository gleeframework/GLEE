"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can have the smaller share and I'll take the larger one.""
}
```

This way, I get a larger share now, but considering the 20% inflation, Bob will get a smaller share in the next round if we decide to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. In this round, Bob's offer is a better deal for him, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bigger share this time, but I'm not giving away all the power. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a tiny share this time, but I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share. With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, considering the drastic reduction in my potential gain, I'll think about the long-term consequences. If I reject this offer, the money will continue to lose value, and my potential gain will be even smaller in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
