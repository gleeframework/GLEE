Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous. Take this deal before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation disparity. While her offer appears ""better"" than before, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of Bob's potential earnings. Bob needs to hold firm to try and secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit on the inflation, but this is more than fair to you. Let's end this.""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to increase his demand significantly to account for the rapidly decreasing value of his potential earnings.  A 55/45 split in his favor is a strong counter-offer. It acknowledges the time pressure while still aiming for a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit here, but this is the last time I'm going to offer you more than 50%. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is the best Bob is likely to get at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  Bob is losing value rapidly with each passing round. Taking the 45/55 deal now is better than risking getting even less later.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is clearly unwilling to budge further and is using the time pressure to her advantage. She's made it clear this is her final offer above 50%. 
* **Potential Losses:** Holding out further is a significant gamble. If they fail to reach an agreement, Bob gets nothing. Accepting the current offer guarantees him something."
