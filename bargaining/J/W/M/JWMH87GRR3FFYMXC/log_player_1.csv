"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 70/30 split.  Let's try a more even split to start. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my thinking.

I don't think a 70/30 split is fair, especially since Bob is proposing a 70/30 split in the opposite direction this time. I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This split should be more acceptable to you.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
