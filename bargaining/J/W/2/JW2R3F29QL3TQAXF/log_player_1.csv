"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We'll split it evenly, so we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob wants to split it evenly this time. However, I'd like to get a slightly larger share, considering the inflation factor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to try to get a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to accept his proposal as is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller share than in the previous round, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, the money I gain is now worth significantly less. Considering Bob's message, it seems he's trying to find a compromise. However, I'd like to get a slightly larger share than $600,000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to try to get a bit more, but I'm not willing to accept his proposal as is."
