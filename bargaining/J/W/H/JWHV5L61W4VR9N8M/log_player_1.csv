"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob will get the remaining 30%, which is $30. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his move."
