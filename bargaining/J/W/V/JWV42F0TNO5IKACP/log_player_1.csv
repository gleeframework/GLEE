"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nIt seems like a reasonable starting point to offer a near-even split, slightly favoring myself to test Bob's negotiation stance. Given the inflation rates, there's a strategic advantage in settling early, but beginning with an offer that slightly favors me allows room for compromise in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem significantly better for me than my initial proposal. Considering the money's decreasing value, especially the greater decrease on Bob's side, it might be strategic to push for a slightly better deal or at least maintain a stronger stance in the next round. The difference in inflation rates between us means that with each round, Bob loses more value than I do, which could make him more inclined to settle sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, I've adjusted my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money. Since Bob loses more value with each round, my strategy is to nudge the offer slightly more in my favor while still presenting it as a fair adjustment for the inflation, hoping Bob will consider settling to avoid further devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us due to inflation, and Bob's message indicating this is his final offer, it seems prudent to accept. The difference in our proposed shares is relatively small, and the further we go, the less both of us will gain in real terms. Accepting now secures a tangible amount rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds, especially since Bob's share is decreasing at a much faster rate, which might make him less willing to compromise further."
