"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a bigger share to make up for it. However, I don't want to risk losing the game by rejecting this offer and having fewer rounds to negotiate.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
