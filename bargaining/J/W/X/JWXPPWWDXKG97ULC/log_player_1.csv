"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm effectively getting $400,000 / 0.8 = $500,000, which is still less than what I initially proposed. However, the offer is still a 60-40 split in Bob's favor.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better next time.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the adjusted values, I'll calculate the effective gains:

* My gain: 350,000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = 678.47 (approximately)
* Bob's gain: 650,000 / 0.8594 (1 - 0.1446) = 755.19 (approximately)

It looks like Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but with a slightly more favorable ratio for me due to the inflation. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer.
