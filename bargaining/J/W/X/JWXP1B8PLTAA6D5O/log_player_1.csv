"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a better deal, considering the reduced value of money. I'm willing to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to account for the reduced value of money.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money continues to decrease. Considering the reduced value, I'll reassess the offer. Since Bob is still offering a 65:35 split, which is closer to my previous offer, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $6,500 and consider this a decent deal, given the circumstances."
