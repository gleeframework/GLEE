Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is fair considering the time pressure and inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of being lowballed. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Bob. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob can afford to hold out a bit longer and see if he can negotiate a better deal as the pressure mounts on Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a fair deal.  This offer reflects the time pressure we both face. Let's close this out and avoid losing more to inflation.""}"
