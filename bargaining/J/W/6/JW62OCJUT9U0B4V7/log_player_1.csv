"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $30, which is 30% of the original $100. I'm keeping $70 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $55 is worth 10% less than the $70 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $63 in the first round.

Bob's gain of $45 is worth 5% less than the $30 he could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $28.25 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here... I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share too.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a bit less than what he wanted, but I'm keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's call it a draw. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $50 is worth 27.1% less than the $70 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $50.71 in the first round.

Bob's gain of $50 is worth 14.26% less than the $30 he could have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $25.84 in the first round.

This offer seems like a fair compromise, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
