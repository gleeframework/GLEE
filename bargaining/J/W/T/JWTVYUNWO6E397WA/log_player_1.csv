"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, my gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,600 (80% of $4,000) and Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth $4,800 (80% of $6,000).

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me, and 20% less for Bob. Since my offer in Round 1 was $8,000, my offer in Round 3 would be 90% of that, which is $7,200. Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was $6,000, his offer in Round 3 would be 80% of that, which is $4,800.

However, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the value of the money in Round 4, I'll apply the inflation rates:

My gain in Round 1 was $8,000, and it's worth 72.9% of that now (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). So, my gain in Round 4 would be $5,832 (72.9% of $8,000).

Bob's gain in Round 1 was $2,000, and it's worth 51.2% of that now (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). So, Bob's gain in Round 4 would be $1,024 (51.2% of $2,000).

However, Bob's offer in Round 4 is $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
