"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Think about it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the new offer, I'll get 70 dollars, which is worth 56 dollars in the original amount (since 70 * 0.8 = 56).

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. So, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.
