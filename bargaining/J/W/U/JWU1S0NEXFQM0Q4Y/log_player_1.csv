"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth less than it was in the first round. I'll think about it...

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but still a decent share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good amount for myself and giving Bob a reasonable share."
