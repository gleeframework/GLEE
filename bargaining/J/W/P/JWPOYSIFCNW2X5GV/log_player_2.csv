"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more but you still get a lot 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can do better!  We have plenty of time and rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering we both have equal power in this game.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd love more, the inflation is hitting hard. Accepting this offer is better than losing more money each round."
