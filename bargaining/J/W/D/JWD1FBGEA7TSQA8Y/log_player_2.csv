Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are over halfway through the rounds, and the money is rapidly losing value. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting for a slightly better offer isn't worth the risk of losing a significant chunk of the remaining value due to inflation.
* **Better Than Nothing:** If we continue to reject offers, we risk walking away with nothing. 

It's frustrating that Alice is playing hardball, but sometimes a reasonable compromise is better than holding out for an ideal outcome that is unlikely to materialize."
