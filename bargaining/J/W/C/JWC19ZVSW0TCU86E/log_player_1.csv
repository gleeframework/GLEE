"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $1, hoping he accepts it. He likely won't know about the inflation, so this will be a great deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. Bob is already getting more than half the money, and I know that the money will be worth less for him in the next round due to inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000.  He's going to be losing value with each passing round and I'm hoping he'll realize that this is a better deal than he'll be able to get later."

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  While it's a 50/50 split, I know that Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine. I'm confident I can do better than a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $50,000.  He's losing value rapidly due to inflation and I think he's going to start getting desperate. I'm hoping he'll take this deal before things get even worse for him."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering me $800,000, I know that his money is worth significantly less than in the first round due to inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 900000 
# Bob gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  While I know that I could potentially get more in the next round, I'm not sure how much longer Bob will be willing to play this game. He's losing value rapidly due to inflation, and he may start to get desperate and accept an even worse offer for him. I'm also getting a very large portion of the money, and I'm not sure how much more I could realistically get."
