{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll offer 55-45. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 55-45 split, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, 45-55 in your favor. Take it or leave it!""}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to try to get a deal done, but I'm still trying to keep a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting more generous, I'll meet you in the middle at 50-50. Take it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's 50-50 offer is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. I've already given up a significant amount of money due to inflation, and I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value."
