"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, Bob. Let's split it 48/52.  This takes into account the inflation, and gives you a little more. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has slightly increased my share, considering the inflation that has already reduced the value of the money I'll receive by 9.75%, her offer still doesn't compensate for the loss in value over the rounds. I'll hold out for a better deal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll aim to make an offer that better reflects the impact of inflation on my share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on my end. I need a larger share to make up for the loss in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point.  Let's try 45/55. This gives you a bit more, but I still get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current offer and the impact of inflation on my share, Alice's proposal of 55/45 seems reasonable. Since the money I gain is already worth 18.55% less than in the first round, holding out for further rounds risks diminishing the value even more without a guarantee of a better offer. Accepting this offer secures a larger share for me before the value decreases further.\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to accept this division to ensure I get a relatively fair share considering the circumstances."
