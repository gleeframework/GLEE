"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get a better share for me 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
