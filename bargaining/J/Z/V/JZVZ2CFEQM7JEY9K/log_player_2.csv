"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, I'm willing to bet she'll be more desperate in later rounds as the money loses value for her much faster.  I'll counter with a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate and the money is losing value fast for both of us.  Holding out a little longer might work in my favor, even if I have to accept a slightly less favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Time is running out, let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses. The money is rapidly losing value, and if I push it further, I risk getting nothing at all. Accepting a slightly lower amount now is better than risking a complete loss in later rounds."
