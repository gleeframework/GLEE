Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's fair and avoids further negotiation with inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
