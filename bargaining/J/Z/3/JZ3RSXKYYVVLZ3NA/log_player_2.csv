"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work towards a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000 now, it's crucial to consider the inflation.  Rejecting allows me to make the proposal next round and secure a larger share before the money's value diminishes further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor, but I'm open to negotiating further.  Let's find a deal that works for both of us before the money loses too much value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is becoming a serious factor.  Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount of money, albeit less than I'd like, before the value drops further."
