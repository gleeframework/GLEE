"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to give Bob $40, and I'll take $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 38 ($40 * 0.95)
* Bob gain: 57 ($60 * 0.95)

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than half of the money, but I think this is a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
