"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 100,000$, but I'm not sure if I want to push it further and risk getting an even worse deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
