"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can reassess""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting that we can reassess our offer as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for making the offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to get a decent share.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to 20% inflation twice, I'll aim to get a larger share this round.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round, but I'm hoping to make up for it later""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not giving up 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. However, I still want to try to get a decent share.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. I'll aim to get a slightly larger share this round, but I'll have to be careful not to be too greedy.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up yet""
}
```"
