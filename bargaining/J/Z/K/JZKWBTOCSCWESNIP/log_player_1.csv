"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. You can do better than this?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000, which is 60%. I'm hoping Bob will think this is a fair starting point and accept the offer."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than this? I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my offer would have been 540,000 for me and 460,000 for Bob in the first round, but Bob's offer now is 300,000 for me and 700,000 for him. I think I can do better than this.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob! I'll give you a better deal this time.""
