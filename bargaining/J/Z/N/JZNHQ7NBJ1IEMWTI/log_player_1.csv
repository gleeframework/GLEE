Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I think 30 is a bit too low for me, considering the initial amount was 100$. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a higher amount for myself."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer. Meeting in the middle seems like a good compromise, and I'm willing to give Bob a bit more. I think 65 is a decent amount for me, and I'm happy to accept this offer."
