"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust in the next round if you'd prefer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is being somewhat polite, the disparity is too large and the devaluation hurts Bob more than Alice. Bob needs to counter with a much fairer offer quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's not a fair start, Alice. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's be reasonable and avoid this dragging on.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take a bit less, but a 65/35 split in my favor is fair considering inflation.  Let's reach an agreement before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use the inflation against Bob, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Bob needs to hold his ground and push for a more equitable split, as time is working against Alice more than him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This isn't going anywhere, Alice. I'm being more than fair with a 55/45 split considering the time pressure. Let's just settle this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer. I'll meet you halfway on the last offer. Let's both take a little less to avoid the risk of getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but accepting is probably the smartest move for Bob now. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds left, the risk of both getting nothing is increasing rapidly. 
* **Inflation:**  The longer they wait, the less the money is worth to *both* of them. However, the 10% devaluation hit to Alice each round makes her feel the pressure more than Bob. 
* **Alice is Moving:** Alice has made a concession and is showing a willingness to compromise. She's likely feeling the heat of the shrinking pot.

While not ideal, getting $4,700 is better than risking a complete loss if the negotiation goes to the very end."
