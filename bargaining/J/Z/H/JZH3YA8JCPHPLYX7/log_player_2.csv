# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but her offers are getting worse! I need to hold firm and demonstrate I'm serious about a fair split, even with the inflation pressure."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting painful.  I'm offering you a larger share than your last proposal. Let's be done with this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough spot. Alice is right, the inflation is really hurting, and this offer is *slightly* better than my last. However, she's clearly trying to use the time pressure against me. I need to show I'm willing to risk it all to get a somewhat reasonable deal. Accepting now would send the wrong message."
