6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a reasonable starting point to ensure we both benefit before inflation eats into the value.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more fair, considering we both have an equal chance to propose. Let's avoid further inflation and reach an agreement.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you 4300, which is more than you would have gotten last round after inflation.  This is a fair deal that benefits us both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses. It's the most sensible choice for both of us at this point.",Bob,4,
