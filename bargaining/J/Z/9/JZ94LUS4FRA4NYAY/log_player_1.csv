"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and Bob's offer is still quite unfair. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a majority share""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I need some for myself, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer because the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and I'm willing to take what I can get. Getting 75% of the remaining value is still a decent deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
