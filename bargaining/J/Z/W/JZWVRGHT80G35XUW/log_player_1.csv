"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the money will lose value with each round. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value with each round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. With the money losing value at 10% per round, I'd like to aim for a higher share to account for the depreciation. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards his gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money losing value at 10% per round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the depreciation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try an even split to account for the inflation. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing an even split, which should give us both a fair share considering the decreasing value of the money."
