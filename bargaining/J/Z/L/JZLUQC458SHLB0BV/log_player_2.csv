**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage, but her offers are getting increasingly worse for me. While a 57/43 split might seem tempting, it's important to hold my ground. The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for her, giving me a stronger position in the negotiation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This back and forth is pointless. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and prevents us both from losing even more money to inflation."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, a firm stance is necessary. Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Emphasizes fairness:** It directly addresses Alice's attempts to exploit the situation.
* **Highlights the shrinking pie:**  The longer she waits, the less valuable her potential gains become.
* **Shows resolve:**  It signals that I'm not going to be swayed by her tactics and am willing to wait for a reasonable deal."
