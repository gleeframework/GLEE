```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation penalty that Bob will face if he chooses to reject my offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

I've reduced my share slightly, taking into account the fact that Bob's share will be worth even less due to inflation. I think this is a more reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
