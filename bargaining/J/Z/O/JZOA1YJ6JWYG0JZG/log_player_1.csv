"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $55, leaving $45 for Bob. The message emphasizes the importance of finding a fair and prompt agreement, given the looming threat of inflation that will devalue the money for both of us with each passing round. By accepting this offer, Bob would not only secure a significant portion of the money but also avoid further devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation concerns, let's make a deal that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because accepting $45, which is worth 5% less than in the first round, seems less favorable compared to the potential for a better offer in the next round. Considering the inflation rates, Bob is under more pressure to reach an agreement since his share devalues more significantly with each round. I aim to leverage this to negotiate a more advantageous deal in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Considering the increased devaluation for you, this is a fair adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose taking $53, leaving $47 for Bob. The message acknowledges the greater impact of inflation on Bob's share and presents this division as a reasonable adjustment, considering the devaluation that has occurred over the rounds. This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable share for myself and providing Bob with an incentive to accept, given the decreasing value of the money for him."
