"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This offer gives me 99% of the money, leaving Bob with 1%. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, as he'll get something rather than nothing. However, with the threat of inflation, I need to get most of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes this a much more reasonable offer than the previous one.  I'm guaranteed half the money, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
