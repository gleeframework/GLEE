Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a higher share to compensate for the increasing inflation rate disadvantage I'll face in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation dynamics and Bob's previous offer, I propose a more equitable division to reflect the diminishing value of money. This aims to balance our shares while considering the increasing disadvantage Bob faces in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
