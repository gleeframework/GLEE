"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I propose we take $60 and you get $40.  It's a good deal for you in the first round.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn! How about we reverse that offer? It's still early, plenty of time to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'll come down a bit to $55, and you get $45.  Remember, the value for you decreases each round!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain! Let's meet in the middle.  My turn to propose $55 for me and $45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against him. While he's offering to ""meet in the middle,"" the deal is much worse for me than my previous offer due to the decreasing value of his share. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 57,
""bob_gain"": 43,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out!  This is a reasonable offer, and you need to take inflation seriously. I'm at $57, you get $43.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking! I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This offer is more than fair. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still heavily undervaluing the impact of inflation. His offer is barely better than his last one, and with each round, the value of his share diminishes significantly. I need to remain firm and wait for a better offer."

""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm being serious now. You're running out of time and every round costs you money. This is my final offer -  $58 for me, $42 for you. Take it or leave it.""
