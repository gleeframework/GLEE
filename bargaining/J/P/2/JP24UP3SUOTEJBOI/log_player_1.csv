"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my share of 400,000 is now worth 380,000 (400,000 x 0.95). Meanwhile, Bob's share of 600,000 is worth 576,000 (600,000 x 0.96, assuming the inflation effect on Bob is 4% less than mine).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent deal. I'll accept it.
