"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll think carefully about this new offer... Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, hoping to get a better deal than the previous offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer!

Considering the effects of inflation, Bob's offer is actually a decent one. I'll think carefully about it... Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
