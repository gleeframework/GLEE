"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it seems quite unfair. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counter proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""}\n\nSince the money loses value over time for me, I'd like to reach an agreement soon. I believe a 60-40 split is more reasonable, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
