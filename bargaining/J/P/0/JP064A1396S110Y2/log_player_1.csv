"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can start fresh.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a compromise, Alice. 50/50 split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 in Round 2 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $4,750.

I don't think a 50/50 split is fair, considering I was willing to offer Bob $4,000 in the first round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, so the total amount is now $9,000.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to find a sweet spot for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I need a better deal. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,500 in Round 3 is worth 86.74% of the original amount, which is $4,579.10. And now, in Round 4, my gain of $4,500 is worth 90.74% of the original amount, which is $4,583.10.

Bob's offer is now $5,500, which is worth 55% of the original $10,000. I think this is a relatively good deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time.
