"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is now worth 5% less than my initial offer, I'll have to consider this.

However, I'm not too keen on accepting an equal split, especially since I was initially offered a $6,000 gain. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less from the first round and another 5% from the second round), I'll make a new offer. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
I'm offering Bob $4,500, and I'll take $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer. However, I notice that Bob's offer is now worth 14.26% less than my initial offer, and it's also lower than my previous offer.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.
