"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, but still leave some room for Bob to negotiate."

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth less than my initial gain of $6000. Bob's offer seems fair, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think for a moment...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking its toll! My previous gain of $5000 is now worth even less. I'll try to make a new offer that accounts for the decreased value of money. Here's my next proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains! With my previous gain of $5500 now being worth even less, I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer. However, I don't want to get stuck with a worse deal later on, so I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
