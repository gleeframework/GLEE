"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given that I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I think this is a fair offer.  Accepting this means I'll still gain something, and if I reject, I risk losing even more due to inflation.  Let's see how much I'll actually get."
