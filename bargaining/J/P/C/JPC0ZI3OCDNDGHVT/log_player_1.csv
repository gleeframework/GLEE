"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, hoping to secure the lion's share early on.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 51 
# Bob gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  taking a 51/49 split is better than risking Bob rejecting my offer again and possibly getting even less in the next round."
