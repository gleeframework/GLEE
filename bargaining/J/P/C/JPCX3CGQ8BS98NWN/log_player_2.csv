Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteracting inflation requires a more substantial adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation argument to her advantage, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer the game goes on, the more the value of the money decreases for her, making her desperate for a deal. We can likely push for an even better outcome in later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point.  The longer this drags on, the worse it is for Alice, but it also increases the risk of walking away with nothing for both of us.
* **Fairness Appeal:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair and easy to agree on. It removes the need for complex negotiations and appeals to Alice's sense of fairness, especially as she's been pushing for a larger share.
* **Inflation Awareness:** While the message acknowledges inflation, the offer itself reflects that time is running out. This might prompt Alice to accept a deal rather than risk further devaluation."
