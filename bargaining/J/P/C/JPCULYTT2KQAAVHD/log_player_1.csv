Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $999,999 and leave Bob with $1.  Since I get to propose first, and the money is losing value for me each round, I want to secure as much of it as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to have more money, it's better to take the 500,000 now, since the money I get is worth less with each passing round."
