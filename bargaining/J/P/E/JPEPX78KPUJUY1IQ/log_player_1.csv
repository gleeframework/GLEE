Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think a 60/40 split is more reflective of the situation. This ensures you still get a good deal before inflation impacts the value further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's go with 55/45.  Inflation is biting, but I'm still trying to be fair.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressure of the inflation, so I'm adjusting my previous offer.  58/42 is my final offer, let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not ideal, the inflation means it's better to accept now than risk getting a worse deal later."
