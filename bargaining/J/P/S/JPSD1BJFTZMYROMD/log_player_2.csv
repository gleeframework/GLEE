Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth less, so I need to be careful. Since Alice's offer is 50/50, it's a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it to see if I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth even less. Alice's offer is still a 55/45 split, which is still relatively fair. Since I rejected the 50/50 split earlier, I should be willing to accept a slightly skewed split. I'll accept this offer.
