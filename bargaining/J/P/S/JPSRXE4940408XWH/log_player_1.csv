Let's see how Bob reacts to my generous offer!  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept a 50/50 split!  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially since inflation is working against Bob.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm sticking with a proposal that gives me a larger share.  Bob needs to realize that I'm not going to settle for less, especially since inflation is eating away at the value of the money.  Let's see if he's finally willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedier! He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to give up a little more to avoid further rounds and the additional inflation that would affect me.  I'm still confident I'm getting a better deal than Bob's last proposal. Let's see if he finally sees reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse!  I'm not going to give in to his greed.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round, even with the increasing inflation.  Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm making a final stand for a fair split. I'm tired of this back-and-forth, and inflation is making my share shrink rapidly.  I'm hoping Bob will finally see that a 50/50 split is the only reasonable solution at this point."
