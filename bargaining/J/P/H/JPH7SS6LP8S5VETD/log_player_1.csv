Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation will favor Bob in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is still heavily in my favor, and I can make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  While the inflation is still in my favor, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and the risk of a less favorable outcome."
