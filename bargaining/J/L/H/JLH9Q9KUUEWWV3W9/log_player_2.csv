Round 5

# Alice's message: Getting closer, come on 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Bob), Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger share, or we risk running out of rounds and getting nothing.  It's a gamble, but I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Time is running critically short.  I need to signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a larger share, but also offer something that might tempt her to settle. This offer is a slight concession on my part but is still heavily weighted in my favor.  The ""final offer"" language is intended to create urgency and push her towards accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the clock is the enemy here. With each passing round, the value of the deal plummets for me.  Alice is clearly playing hardball, but this offer is better than anything I can hope to negotiate in the remaining rounds with inflation working against me.  It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all."
