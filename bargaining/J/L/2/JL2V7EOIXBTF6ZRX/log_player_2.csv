"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I propose we divide the money in a way that reflects the difference in the value of money for us over time. I'll take a slightly larger share since it's worth more to me. 
# Bob gain: 230769.23 
# Alice gain: 769230.77 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is generous, it's better to see if I can get a better deal by playing a few rounds. The value of the money will decrease for both of us, but the rate of decrease is much higher for me, so I have more to gain by waiting."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the higher inflation rate I face. This ensures we both get a significant share while accounting for the value depreciation.""}
