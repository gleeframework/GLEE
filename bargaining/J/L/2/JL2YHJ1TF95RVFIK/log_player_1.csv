"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a significant portion for both of us, considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to let you take all the risk. This is a 60/40 split in my favor, but it's still a reasonable offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
