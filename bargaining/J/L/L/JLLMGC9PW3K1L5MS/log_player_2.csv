Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to propose a split that is more favorable to me, but still offers Alice a decent amount. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but I'm still hoping to get a more favorable deal. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick with a proposal that's slightly more favorable to me, but still offers a fair share to Alice. This time, I'm hoping she sees that continuing to reject offers will only hurt her in the long run."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting progressively worse for her, and I'm not sure how much longer she can afford to reject. I'll accept this offer, as it's still a decent amount, and I'm not sure how much better it can get with the inflation affecting us both."
