"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. The message is a friendly introduction to the game."
