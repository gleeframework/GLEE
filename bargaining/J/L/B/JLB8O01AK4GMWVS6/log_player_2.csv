Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and your share is worth less and less. This is my final 'generous' offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

At this point, it's better to accept the offer.  While the inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains,  further rounds will only worsen the situation.  It's a gamble to keep going, and a 440,000 gain is better than potentially getting nothing."
