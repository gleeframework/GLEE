"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I take 900,000 dollars and Bob takes 100,000. This way, I get the majority, but Bob still gets a decent amount. It leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
``` 

I'm going to reduce my share slightly but still keep the majority.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob than the previous rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I am still hoping to get a larger share of the money, and I believe that with careful negotiation I can still achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority. The inflation is hitting hard now, but I'm hoping Bob will see that this offer is better than the previous ones, considering how much his share is decreasing as well."
