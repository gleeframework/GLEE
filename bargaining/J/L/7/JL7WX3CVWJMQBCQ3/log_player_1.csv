"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split the funds 50/50. It's a fair and reasonable proposal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
