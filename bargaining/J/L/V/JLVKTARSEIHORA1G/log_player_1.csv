I'm going to propose a division of 900,000$ for me and 100,000$ for Bob. I'm confident that this is a fair deal considering the inflation will benefit me more than him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower split than the previous round, but it's still a good deal for me.  I'm betting that Bob will be more willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further inflation."
