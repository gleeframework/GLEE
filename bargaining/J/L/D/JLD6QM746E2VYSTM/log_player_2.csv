"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split 60/40. I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation will significantly affect Alice more than me in the future rounds. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm proposing we split 60/40. I think this is a fairer deal considering the inflation will impact you more heavily in the future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm taking a smaller cut to account for the inflation hitting me harder, but your previous offer was way off. 55/45 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I still think I can get a slightly better deal, the inflation is getting serious, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better outcome. It's time to secure some of the money before we both lose it."
