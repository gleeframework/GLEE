Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was quite cheeky! Let's be realistic. I propose an 80/20 split.  This still gives you a significant advantage considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 650000
