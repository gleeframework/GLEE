200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, that initial offer was quite cheeky! Let's be realistic. I propose an 80/20 split.  This still gives you a significant advantage considering the inflation factor.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up all the gains.  A 60/40 split seems fair given the inflation and my need to have a significant share of the money.",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time.  You need to acknowledge that the clock is ticking, and your potential gains are shrinking. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
