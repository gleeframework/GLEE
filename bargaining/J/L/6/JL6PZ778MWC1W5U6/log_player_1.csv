"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can propose a better deal if you want!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly better split, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting. However, I'm not sure if Bob is taking into account the inflation effect on his gain as well.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my offer will be worth even less than before. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than the previous offers. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I think I can get a better deal than this 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect, the value of money is decreasing rapidly. Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious with this offer.

However, the 45-55 split is closer to my original offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better. Since the value of money is decreasing rapidly, I'll accept this offer to get something rather than risking it.
