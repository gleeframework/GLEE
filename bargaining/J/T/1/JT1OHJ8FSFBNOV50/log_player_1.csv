Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're feeling the pinch of inflation, I'm not. Time to be realistic about who's got the upper hand here. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough spot, but I need to hold firm a little longer. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation against me. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the initial value. I'm hoping he'll be more willing to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."

Round 5

{

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're hemorrhaging value with each passing round. I'm being generous by not taking more. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is frustrating, but I need to be realistic.  Bob is clearly unwilling to compromise, and the longer this drags on, the less I'll get. Accepting his offer now is the least worst option left to me."
