"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Since Bob is offering me $400,000, which is the same amount I initially offered him, I'll reject this offer as well. It's not a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to adjust my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000 and keeping $540,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
