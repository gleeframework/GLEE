"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer.  Even though the money is worth less with each round, I'm not going to accept getting only 1% of the money. I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This is a very high offer for me, but I think it is fair since Alice only got 10% of the money in the first round.  Hopefully, she accepts it, but if she rejects it I can be confident that her counteroffer will be better than her initial one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still extremely unfair.  Even with the inflation, I'm getting a very small percentage of the money.  I'm hoping that as we progress, Alice will realize she needs to offer me a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  I'm hoping that Alice will recognize that her initial offers are very unreasonable. I'm still willing to give her a significant portion of the money, but I need to be compensated for the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse!  Even though the money is worth significantly less for me now, I still need to get a much larger share. I'm sticking to my principle of fairness."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  I'm still confident that I can get a fair deal, but I'm worried that Alice is becoming more and more unreasonable.  I need to show her that I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still incredibly unfair.  Even though the money is worth much less for me now, I still need to get a much larger share.  I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm not going to give in to this kind of offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

The pressure of inflation is starting to get to me, but I'm going to try and hold firm.  It's clear Alice isn't willing to compromise, and I'm going to try and make her see that we both need to meet in the middle.  I'm offering a 50/50 split - this is the most fair offer I can make at this point.  If she rejects it, I'm really starting to worry about getting a fair deal at all."
