"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can call it a day.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it more evenly this time. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's new offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to continue negotiating, as the offer is still not favorable for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still need a fair share.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding on to a larger portion of the money."
