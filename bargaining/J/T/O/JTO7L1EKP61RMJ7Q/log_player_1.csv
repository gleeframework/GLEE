"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Offer:**  Alice takes $900,000, Bob takes $100,000. 

**Reasoning:** Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I'm starting with a large share for myself, but still leaving him with something. This might encourage him to accept the offer in the first round."
