"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see how this goes. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. 

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
A 50-50 split seems fair, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
