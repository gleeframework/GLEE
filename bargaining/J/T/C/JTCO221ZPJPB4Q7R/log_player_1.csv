"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd get $5,400 if we went back to the original proposal.

Bob's new offer is $3,000 for me and $7,000 for him. Since the money is worth less now, I'd actually get $3,030 and Bob would get $6,850.

I think I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
