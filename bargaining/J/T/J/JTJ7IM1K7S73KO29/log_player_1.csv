"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll propose a 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if needed.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me at least half of the money, even with the 20% inflation. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the potential for further inflation makes this a good deal."
