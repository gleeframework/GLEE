"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the lion's share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, taking 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to reject my offer!

Considering the new offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money after the 20% inflation:

My gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I think I can do better. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll aim to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's call it a day!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to outmaneuver me! Let's calculate the effective value of the money after the 48.8% inflation:

My gain: 4500 * 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) = 2323.1
Bob's gain: 5500 * 0.5162 = 2833.1

This offer is actually a bit more favorable for me than my previous one, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
