"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering I'm taking the risk of being rejected and having to negotiate further.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small piece of the pie in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and taking it means I get to secure half the money before the inflation devalues it further.  It's a risk to keep rejecting offers, especially since Bob's offer is closer to 50/50 than mine was."
