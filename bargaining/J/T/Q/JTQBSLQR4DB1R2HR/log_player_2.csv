Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. I understand you want a larger share than my first offer. How about $5,600 for me and $4,400 for you? This factors in the inflation a bit better for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600
