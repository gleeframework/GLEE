5500.0,4500.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's meet closer to the middle. I propose a 45/55 split.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the move towards the middle, Bob, I think we can find a solution that benefits us both a bit more in the long run. Let's see what the next round brings.",Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this. I understand you want a larger share than my first offer. How about $5,600 for me and $4,400 for you? This factors in the inflation a bit better for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. We're both losing money with each round.  Let's be fair and split it 50/50 before inflation eats away at it further.",Bob,4,
,,"You're right, Bob, time is money! A 50/50 split makes sense. Let's end this before we lose any more to inflation.",Alice,4,accept
