"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I want to try to end the game as quickly as possible while still being somewhat fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases quickly for you. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the value of the money decreases by 20% for me with each round, I need to be strategic about when to accept an offer. In this case, Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor is not good enough for me to accept, especially considering that the money is worth less to me now than it was in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's compromise""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer from the previous round. Since the value of the money continues to decrease for me, I want to try to end the game as soon as possible while still getting a relatively good deal. I'll offer a 58-42 split in my favor, which is slightly less than my initial offer but still more than Bob's offer from the previous round. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now. This is my final offer. It's the best you'll get considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant decrease in value of the money for me due to inflation (it's now worth 48.8% less than in the first round), and given that Bob has stated this is his final offer, I believe accepting this deal is the best option. The difference between what I'm offered now and what I could potentially gain by continuing is not worth the risk of the money losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer of a 48-52 split in his favor to end the game and secure what's left of the value."
