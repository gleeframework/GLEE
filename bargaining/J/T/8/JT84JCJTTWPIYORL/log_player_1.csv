"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to have a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I understand the money is losing value, I think this is a fairer division, considering I'm taking the risk of being left with less in the next round if we don't reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
