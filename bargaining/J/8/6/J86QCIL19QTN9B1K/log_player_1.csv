"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

I'll think about Bob's offer for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I want to get more than $6,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can still make a good deal!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $7,000 and offering Bob $3,000. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want to be closer to 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now!

I'll consider Bob's new offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him. It's a 50/50 split, and I think it's a fair deal considering the decreasing value of money."
