Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Alice proposes a 900k to 100k split, aiming for a large share while still offering something to Bob. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy for Alice, but it's a good starting point considering the inflation effects.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice rejects Bob's offer.  While Bob is offering a significant sum, Alice sees an opportunity to still get a larger share, especially given the inflation factor.  

The game is on! It will be Alice's turn to propose in round 3.  Alice's next offer needs to be strategic, considering the dwindling value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

Alice lowers her proposed share slightly but maintains a significant lead.  This strategy balances the risk of losing the negotiation with the need to stay ahead of Bob's demands.  Given the increasing inflation, Alice is likely to be more willing to accept a smaller share in the future rounds, but for now, she still aims for a favorable outcome.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice rejects Bob's offer.  The offer, while representing a significant amount in absolute terms, is worth less than 50% of what Alice offered in the previous round due to inflation.  With 8 rounds left, Alice believes she can still achieve a more favorable outcome by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

Alice lowers her proposed share again, but still maintains a comfortable lead over Bob.  With the inflation hitting harder with each round,  Alice needs to balance the risk of being left with nothing against the desire for a larger share.  She believes this offer is still fair considering the changing circumstances and hopes Bob will accept it."
