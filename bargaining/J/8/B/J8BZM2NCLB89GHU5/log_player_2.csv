"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I think this is a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair and split this evenly.  ""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  I'm offering you 25 which is more valuable now than later. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a better deal for you than before, and it still gets us a decent amount considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need you to be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While my potential gains are shrinking, accepting a 25/75 split sets a bad precedent. There's still time to negotiate a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This is my final offer before I have to drastically reduce my ask to account for inflation. Let's end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out. Let's settle on my original offer. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get in the remaining rounds. Alice seems firm on her position, and the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming too high."
