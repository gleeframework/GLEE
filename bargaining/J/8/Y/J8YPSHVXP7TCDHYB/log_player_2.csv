"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob.  But let's be realistic - 60/40 in your favor is still quite a disparity, especially after the inflation we've experienced.  How about we aim for something closer to a 55/45 split? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to give up as much as 55% to you, Alice. But I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a 55/45 split in my favor, as you suggested. This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but it's still a compromise that should work for both of us.""}"
