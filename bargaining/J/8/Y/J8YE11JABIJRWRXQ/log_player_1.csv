"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and balanced split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better with a 60-40 split in my favor. It's a fair reflection of my time spent on this task, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a 60-40 split in his favor, just like my initial offer, but with the numbers flipped.

However, considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: $4,000 (initially $6,000, but 20% less due to inflation) is actually worth $3,200
* Bob's gain: $6,000 (initially $4,000, but 5% more due to... um... Bob's inflation?) is actually worth $5,700

Considering the values are now skewed in Bob's favor due to the inflation, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was a 60-40 split in his favor, and considering the inflation, I'll try to adjust the numbers to my advantage. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a more favorable ratio for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider this more equitable split, considering the inflation has already taken a toll on the value of the money."
