"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't think I should accept an offer that gives Bob a 10% bigger share than me. I'll make a new proposal in Round 3!"

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 16% difference in our shares. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll make another proposal in Round 5 to try to get a better deal."
