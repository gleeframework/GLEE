"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds, while the money's value decreases for Alice.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since the money's value decreases for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my proposal for round 2. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 45/55.  It's better than losing everything with more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money's value remains the same for me, I can continue to negotiate for a better deal. Given that Alice is already feeling the effects of inflation, with her share being worth 36% less, I believe I can push for an even more favorable split in the next rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll wait for the outcome or make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""The value of money decreases for you, so I'll take a bit more. You should accept before it's worth even less in the next rounds.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my proposal for round 4. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject it."
