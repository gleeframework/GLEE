"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. While I am willing to share, I believe this initial offer reflects my dominant position in this negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the initial offer was not ideal, it was much closer to what I would have liked. Bob's offer is far too one-sided, and the inflation will hurt me more than it will hurt him. I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 700,000 to 300,000 split in my favor. I've reduced my desired share to be more reasonable, but I still believe I should receive a significant portion of the money given the inflated value for Bob.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While his offer is closer to my desired outcome than the previous round, it is still not acceptable.  The inflation is severely impacting the value of the money for Bob, but I still believe that I should receive a larger share.  I am ready to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 500,000 to 500,000 split.  The inflation has significantly impacted both of us. It's time to be realistic, and this seems like the fairest compromise given the current situation.  Let's end this negotiation on a fair note."
