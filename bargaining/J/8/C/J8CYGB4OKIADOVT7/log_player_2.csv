Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

However, Alice's offer is still quite close to the previous offer, and I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.
