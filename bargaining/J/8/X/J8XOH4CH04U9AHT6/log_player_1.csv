"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm now being offered $400,000, which is 80% of the original $500,000 I was offered in the first round, I'm not sure if it's a good deal.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was slightly biased towards him, I'll try to counterbalance it. I'll offer him a smaller share, but still a fair one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $460,000 is equivalent to 46% of the original $1,000,000. Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, his $540,000 is worth less than 54% of the original $1,000,000. This offer seems more balanced than the previous ones.

I'll accept this offer.
