60.0,40.0,Let's split 60/40. It's a fair deal that lets us both benefit from this game.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering we both want to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  We're losing money with every round. I'm willing to come down a bit to 58/42. This is a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away even more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 52/48 is a good middle ground, and we should take it before the money loses even more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, we're running out of time! I'm dropping my offer to 55/45. This is a fair split, and we need to agree before we both lose out!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,We're both losing out due to inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest deal at this point. Let's just agree and minimize our losses.,Bob,6,
