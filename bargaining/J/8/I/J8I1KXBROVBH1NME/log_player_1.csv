"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 is a good starting point. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but still willing to compromise. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 250,000$ is now worth 200,000$ and Bob's gain of 750,000$ is now worth 600,000$.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's still heavily skewed towards Bob. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous to Bob. I'd like to try to get a better split. Your turn!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my previous gain of 250,000$ is now worth 200,000$, and Bob's previous gain of 750,000$ is now worth 600,000$.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the money! My gain of 550,000$ is now worth only 280,000$, and Bob's gain of 450,000$ is now worth 360,000$.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, Bob. I was hoping for a bit more. Can you meet me at 500,000 for me?""
}
```"

Round 5
