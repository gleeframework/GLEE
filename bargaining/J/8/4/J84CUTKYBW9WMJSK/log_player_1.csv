Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as he still gets a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, I'm losing a lot of value with each round and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's better to take the $400,000 than risk getting nothing."
