"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, can we compromise on this split? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $5000 is now equivalent to $4000 in the original amount.

I'm willing to meet in the middle, so I accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
