"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message that says ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to be somewhat generous to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer, while still getting a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a slight advantage this round 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, my share of $400,000 is now worth less than it was in the first round. Additionally, Bob is taking a larger share, which I don't think is fair given that I made a fairly generous offer in the first round. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $450,000 and I'll take $550,000. Considering the inflation, my share is actually worth around $495,000 in terms of the original value, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept. My message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise."
