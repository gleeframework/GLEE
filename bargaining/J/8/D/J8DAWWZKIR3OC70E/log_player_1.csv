"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can shake on it?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the fairest way, considering the inflation rates. If we split it evenly now, I'll be getting a smaller share in terms of real value compared to Bob. I'd like to propose an alternative that takes into account the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a good compromise, considering the inflation. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good compromise. With the inflation rates, I'm losing more value than Bob, so I'd like to propose an alternative that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make an offer that prioritizes my share to mitigate the effects of inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to protect my share from the inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further losses from inflation. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is conceding enough. Considering the inflation rates, I'm still losing more value than Bob, and I'd like to propose an alternative that takes this into account. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal to protect my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer to protect my share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I need to prioritize my own share to make up for the losses from inflation. This is my best offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be reasonable here. Let's end this before we both lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a big bite out of the money's value!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that still doesn't take into account the significant difference in the inflation rates. I need to prioritize my share to make up for the losses, and this offer doesn't meet my requirements. I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make an even more aggressive offer to protect my share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not leaving anything on the table. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go down to 300k, but I need to get something out of this. It's getting too risky to keep going. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on the money's value!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob's offer is starting to look more reasonable. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's still better than what I'd get if we went to the final round. I'll take the $700,000 and call it a day."
