"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 4:1 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the 10% reduction in value, I'm now looking at a gain of 4500$ if I accept Bob's offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I think I can do better than that."

Here's my response:

```

# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a big hit on my gains now!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think the 20/80 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
