"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I'm hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge decrease from the previous round, and although he's only taking a 5% hit from inflation, I'm still taking a much larger hit. I'm going to try and push for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer from the previous round.  He's being greedy, so I'm going to stick with a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm hoping he realizes that he's not going to get much more than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial proposal. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm not going to settle for such a low percentage. I'm hoping he'll realize that he needs to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to stick with a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the inflation is making it harder to get a great deal,  I believe a 60/40 split is fair, considering how much Bob has already rejected. Let's see if he'll take it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than what I've been proposing.  Even though I'm taking a huge hit from inflation, I'm going to try and hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try a 55/45 split in my favor.  I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I still want to secure a majority of the money.  This is a slight decrease from my last offer, but it might be enough to sway Bob towards a compromise."
