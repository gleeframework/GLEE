Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking 9000 dollars and leaving 1000 for Bob. I believe this is a fair offer, as I'm taking the majority of the money but still giving him a significant share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the 20% inflation, I'm still getting a significant amount of money.  It's better to take what I can get now rather than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
