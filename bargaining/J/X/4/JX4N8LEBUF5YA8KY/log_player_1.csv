"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep almost all the money, giving Bob just $1.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but if he does, I get the vast majority of the money. If he rejects, we move on to the next round, where I'll have to be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation factor is significant.  It's better to accept this offer and secure 600,000 now than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
