"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in my favor, recognizing the diminishing value of money for me.  This allows for a more equitable outcome than the previous offer while still accounting for the game's dynamics. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
