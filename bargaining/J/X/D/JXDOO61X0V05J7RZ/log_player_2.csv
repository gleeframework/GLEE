"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split for a quicker resolution.""
}
``` 
 
This offer is designed to be tempting to Alice while still being advantageous to Bob. Here's why: 
* **Fairness:**  While not a perfect 50/50 split, it leans more towards fairness than Alice's heavily skewed offer. This makes it more likely for Alice to accept to avoid the risk of further diminishing returns. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Both players are aware that the value decreases with each round. By offering a reasonable split early on, Bob emphasizes the benefit of concluding the game quickly. 
* **Positioning for Future Rounds:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is still in a good position for future negotiations. He's demonstrated a willingness to compromise but also made it clear he won't accept a lopsided deal."
