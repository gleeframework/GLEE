"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as I know the value of the money decreases with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, I'm aware of the inflation and the fact that Bob will be the one making the next offer.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best strategy to avoid getting a worse offer in the future."
