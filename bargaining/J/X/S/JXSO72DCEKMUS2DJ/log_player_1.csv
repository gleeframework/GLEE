"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to consider the equivalent value in the first round.

In the first round, my gain was 6000, which is worth 80% of the original amount due to inflation. So, my gain in the second round is 80% of 6000, which is 4800.

Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so it's 95% of 4000, which is 3800.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me. I accept his offer.
