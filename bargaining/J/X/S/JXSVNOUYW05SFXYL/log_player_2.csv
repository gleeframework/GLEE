"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? This accounts for the inflation disparity while still being a reasonable division. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
