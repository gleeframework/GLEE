"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering we both have to deal with the inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm not sure how much less it's worth for Bob. I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55-45 is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to see a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw and split it 50-50. No need to haggle further.""
}
```"
