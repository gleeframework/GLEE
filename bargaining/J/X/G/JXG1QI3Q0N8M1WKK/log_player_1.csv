"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a straightforward and fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't be serious with 50/50, I'll give you a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""80 for me? That's too greedy! I'll give you a chance to be more generous.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, especially since I'm not sure how much the money is worth to Bob. I'll give him another chance to make a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80/20 and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! I'll take 60, you can have 40.""
}
```

I'm trying to push the split in my favor, but not so aggressively that Bob will reject it outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too generous, I'll take 60, you can have 40, but I'm not giving you 60 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me even harder in the later rounds.

I'll reject his offer again, since it's still not in my favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""70 for you? That's still too much! I'll give you a chance to be more realistic.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that's even more skewed in Bob's favor. I'll try to make another offer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30 and I rejected it, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're being too stingy, Bob! I'll take 55, you can have 45. That's the best I'm willing to offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to push the split even further in my favor, but not so much that Bob will reject it outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not budging much 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation.

I'll reject his offer again, since it's still extremely unfavorable to me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""85 for you? That's outrageous! I'm not falling for it.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, even if it's my last chance to make a deal. I'll try to make one final offer to see if I can get a better deal, or at least a more reasonable one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's getting late in the game, and I'm running out of options. I'll try to make a final offer that's as close to 50/50 as possible, given the current state of the game. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. I'll take 52, you can have 48. Let's end this.""
}
```

I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible, given the circumstances. I'm hoping Bob will see sense and accept this offer, but I'm not counting on it."
