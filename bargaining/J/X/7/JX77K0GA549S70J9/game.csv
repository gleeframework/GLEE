6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple split. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. This ensures we both benefit from dividing the money early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both still get a significant amount, but it's more balanced given the decreasing value of money for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but your offer was too low for me.  I'm proposing $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This is a smaller gap than my previous offer, reflecting the decreasing value over time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4300.0,5700.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value. A 57-43 split seems more appropriate now, considering we're already in round 4.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, we're getting closer to the deadline and losing money with every round.  I'm adjusting my offer to $5,600 for me and $4,400 for you.  It reflects the urgency of the situation while still trying to be fair given the inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4100.0,5900.0,"Considering we're halfway through the rounds and inflation is significantly impacting my gain, I believe a 59-41 split is necessary to compensate for the loss in value. This is my most generous offer yet, and I hope we can conclude the game here to minimize further losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair but we're running out of time. This is my final offer above 5000. I get $5,400 and you get $4,600.  Let's close this deal and avoid losing even more to inflation.",Alice,7,
