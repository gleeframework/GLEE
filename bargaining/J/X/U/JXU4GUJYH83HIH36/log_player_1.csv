"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial amount, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $285,000 (95% of $300,000), while Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth $560,000 (80% of $700,000).

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the 50-70 split. I'd like to propose a more balanced split in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, the money is worth less than before. My gain is now worth 95% of 95% of the original, which is 90.25% of the original amount. So, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm looking for a bigger share. This is my revised offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. My gain of $550,000 in Round 3 is now worth $472,575 (85.74% of $550,000), while Bob's gain of $450,000 is now worth $229,500 (51.00% of $450,000).

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the continued erosion of the money's value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a larger share to account for the inflation. I'm not comfortable with this split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is still eating away at the money's value. My gain of $450,000 in Round 4 is now worth $384,255 (85.57% of $450,000), while Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth $286,500 (52.09% of $550,000).

I'll try to get a better deal in Round 5. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This is my revised offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise again, but I think this is as close as I can get. Let's try to end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now. My gain of $520,000 in Round 5 is now worth $403,116 (77.38% of $520,000), while Bob's gain of $480,000 is now worth $164,400 (34.25% of $480,000).

Considering the offer, I think this is a reasonable compromise. Getting an equal split is better than what I had initially, and it's a decent outcome considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer to end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's end the game here. I'll take the 50-50 split.""
}
```"
