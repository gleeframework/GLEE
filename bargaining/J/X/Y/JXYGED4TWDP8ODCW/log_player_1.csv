"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly. If not, I'll make a new offer next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm also hinting that if Bob doesn't accept, I'll make a new offer that might not be as favorable for him."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
