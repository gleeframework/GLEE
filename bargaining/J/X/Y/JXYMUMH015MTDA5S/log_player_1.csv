"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so my effective gain in Round 2 would be 60% of $100, which is $60, but due to inflation, it's worth 95% of what it was in Round 1. So, in terms of actual value, I would be getting $57.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
