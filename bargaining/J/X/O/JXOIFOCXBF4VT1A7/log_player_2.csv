``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm in a very tough spot now.  The value of the money is plummeting each round.  I need to signal to Alice that I'm getting desperate, and accepting a deal that's heavily in her favor is my best option. If she rejects this offer, I'm in real trouble in the next round as the value will have dropped significantly again."
