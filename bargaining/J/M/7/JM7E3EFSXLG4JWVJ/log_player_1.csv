"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair way to divide the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, that's a good compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise to move forward!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent compromise. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more after your last offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll think carefully about this new offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give him the larger share, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly larger share for myself, considering the money is worth less due to inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
