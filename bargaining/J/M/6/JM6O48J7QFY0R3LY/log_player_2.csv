Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Alice is willing to give me a bigger share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like more, with inflation, I'm unlikely to get a better offer.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
