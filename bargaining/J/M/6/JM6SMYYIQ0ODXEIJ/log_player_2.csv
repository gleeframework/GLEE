Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know we're both losing money with each round. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day. It's the fairest solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a better split, time is running out.  Alice is likely to dig in her heels on a 50/50 split as it seems ""fair"" on the surface.  If I reject this offer, there's a significant risk we'll reach round 12 without a deal, leaving us both with nothing."
