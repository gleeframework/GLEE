I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm offering a significant portion to Bob while still securing a majority for myself.  It's also a safe bet that Bob will likely accept this offer rather than risk getting less in the future.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough one!  Bob is essentially proposing a reversal of our first offer. While this would be a huge gain in the first round, with the inflation factor, I am losing 5% of the value of my potential gains.  It would be better for me to gamble and see if I can secure a better offer in the next round.  I am rejecting this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to adjust my proposal. I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer, and I'm taking $700,000 for myself. This proposal still gives Bob a good chunk of the money, but it also acknowledges that I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept. Let's see what he thinks!"
