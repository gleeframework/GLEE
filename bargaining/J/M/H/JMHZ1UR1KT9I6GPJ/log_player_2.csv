"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Alice was willing to split it 50/50 in the first round, I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself. However, I'll also keep in mind that the money is worth 5% less in the next round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage now.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Since Alice's offer is still a 52/48 split, which is close to the initial 50/50 split, I'll consider it a decent offer.
