"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  You get 10% and I take 90%.  Hopefully, we can agree on something more beneficial for both of us in the future! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is literally money for me in this game, so let's make a deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 60/40 split. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to let you take the majority of the money anymore. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 60/40 split in Alice's favor seems heavily skewed, time is working against me. However, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not palatable. I'm betting Alice will become more reasonable (and worried about getting nothing) as we approach the later rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm offering a 65/35 split. This is a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure and the fact that the value of the money decreases for me each round. Let's close this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to a 55/45 split.  Let's be realistic, I'm not going to accept less than half, and it seems like we are getting closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While still not ideal, Alice's offer of a 55/45 split is the best I'm likely to get at this point. The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me due to inflation. Accepting now secures me a reasonable portion of the money before it depreciates further."
