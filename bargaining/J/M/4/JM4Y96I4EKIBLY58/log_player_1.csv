"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and giving Bob 40% or $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a risk, I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'll make it worth your while later! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth $540,000, and Bob's offer is even more attractive.

However, I'm not convinced by Bob's message. He's trying to lowball me with a smaller share this round, but I'm not sure what his strategy is for the next round. I'd rather not take the risk and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this round. Considering the inflation, my $540,000 from the previous round is now worth $486,000, and I'll aim to get a better share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to lowball me, but I'm not afraid to walk away. Let's meet in the middle this round!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, I was lowballing, but I'm willing to meet you halfway now. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $486,000 from the previous round is now worth $355,110, and Bob's offer is actually a better deal than my previous offer.

I'm glad Bob is willing to meet me halfway, and I think this is a fair offer. I'll accept it.
