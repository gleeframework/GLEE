"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous split, and hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious. With the 20% loss in value, my gain of 50 dollars is effectively worth 40 dollars in the previous round's value.

Considering Bob's offer is now 50-50, which is a more even split, I'll decide to accept this offer. The inflation is making the money less valuable, so I'd rather take a smaller but more stable share.
