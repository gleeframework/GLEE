"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."

# Bob's message: Let's try again, but I think I can do better than 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, and since I'm getting 10% less value for my money due to inflation, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Take it or leave it!""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 45/55 split, especially since my money is worth even less due to inflation. I think I can still do better than this. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
