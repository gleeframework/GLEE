"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation in the later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering the initial proposal was already 4:1 in his favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 9:11. Let's compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 45% share for myself and 55% for Bob, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
