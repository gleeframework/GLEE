"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer is a bit aggressive but gives Alice the majority of the money.  Since there are many rounds left, the threat of inflation may make Bob accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what he offered last round, it's still significantly less than what Alice proposed.  Alice is likely to hold out for more, hoping that inflation will make Bob more willing to compromise in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

Alice is still taking a majority of the money, but has lowered her offer slightly. The inflation is a factor, but Alice is likely still banking on Bob's desire to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob has increased his offer to Alice, it is still considerably less than what Alice offered in the previous round. The inflation is starting to bite, but Alice is still likely holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

Alice is still holding a majority of the money but is now offering Bob a slightly larger share. With inflation hitting 14.26%, Alice is becoming more sensitive to the risk of getting nothing. This offer could be seen as a test to see if Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the diminishing pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has hit Alice hard, and this is the first time Bob is offering a 50/50 split. While Alice still holds out for more, the risk of getting nothing and the increasing inflation make accepting this offer the best choice at this point."
