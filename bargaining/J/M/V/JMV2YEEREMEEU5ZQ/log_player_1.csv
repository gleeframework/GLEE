"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. I'm excited to see how the game unfolds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is worth less each round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round. The 20% decrease in value does make things more challenging, but I'm not ready to settle just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nLet's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value diminishes with each round. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer at this point. The difference in our gains isn't drastic, and further rounds would only diminish my share's value even more. It's time to settle and take what I can get!"
