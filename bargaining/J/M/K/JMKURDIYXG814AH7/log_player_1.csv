"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 240,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's a good starting point. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
