"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I'm hoping to get a larger share. I'll see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I propose we divide the money 6:4 in my favor. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money equally, as I believe fairness should guide our decisions. This also ensures neither of us feels disadvantaged. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  I'll accept."
