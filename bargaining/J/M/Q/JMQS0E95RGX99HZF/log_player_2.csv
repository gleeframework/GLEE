``` 

It's a terrible offer!  There are 12 rounds, and I know the money depreciates by 20% each round.  I'm going to try to negotiate a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a strong counter-offer, giving Alice a small amount to incentivize her to accept. I'm hoping she'll see that rejecting this offer could lead to much less for both of us in the long run due to inflation."

# Alice gain: 800000

Alice is still being incredibly greedy!  I'm going to keep rejecting these offers, hoping she'll realize that we both have a lot to lose if we can't come to an agreement.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the future rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm offering Alice 200,000, which is still a decent amount considering the inflation. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share, and I believe this offer is a good starting point for a compromise."

Alice is still being stubborn. I'm getting increasingly frustrated with this. I will keep rejecting her offers and stick to my proposal in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm sticking to my strategy of offering Alice a fair share, but I'm also increasing my share slightly to show her that the stakes are getting higher. I hope she will recognize that we need to reach an agreement soon before we both lose a significant amount of money."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a fair share, but I'm starting to think we might both lose a lot of money if she doesn't accept soon."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm increasing my share again to 600,000.  I'm hoping that this will finally convince Alice that she needs to compromise.  We are running out of rounds, and both of us will be left with nothing if we don't come to an agreement."
