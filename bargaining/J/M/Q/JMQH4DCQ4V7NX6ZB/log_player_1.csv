"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's side!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 45.5/54.5 split, which is a bit more favorable to him. However, since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation.
