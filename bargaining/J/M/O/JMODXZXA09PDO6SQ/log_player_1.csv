"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. Let's see if he accepts or rejects this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
