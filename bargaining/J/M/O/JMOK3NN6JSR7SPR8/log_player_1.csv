"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take 999,000 for myself and give Bob 1,000.  Since Bob's money is worth less with each round, he'll be better off accepting this now than hoping for a better deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is lower than my previous offer, I'm still getting a significant amount of money. It's better to accept now than risk getting a worse deal later."
