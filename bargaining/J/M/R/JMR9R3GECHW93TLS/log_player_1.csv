"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the higher share this time, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards him, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
