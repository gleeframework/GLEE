"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my thinking with the new inflation rates.

Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll get $45 * 0.8 = $36. And Bob will get $55 * 0.95 = $52.25.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll get $36 * 0.8 = $28.8. And Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'll get $52.25 * 0.95 = $49.5125.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```"
