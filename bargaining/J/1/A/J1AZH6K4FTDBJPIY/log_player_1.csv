I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal, hoping to get a good deal for myself while still giving Bob something to consider.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept that! Bob's offer is way too unfair, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

This time I'm offering a more balanced split. Hopefully, this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm ready for another round!"
