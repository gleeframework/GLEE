I propose that Alice receives $6000 and Bob receives $4000.  This is a fair starting point, as it gives me a slight advantage, but leaves room for negotiation."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
