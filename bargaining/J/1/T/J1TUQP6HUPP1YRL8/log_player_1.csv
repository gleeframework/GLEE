"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more!""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, a 80-20 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the current value.

In Round 1, $8,000 was worth $8,000, and $2,000 was worth $2,000. Now, in Round 2, $8,000 is worth $7,200 (10% less), and $2,000 is worth $1,900 (5% less).

Bob's offer in Round 2 is $4,000 for me and $6,000 for him. This is equivalent to $3,840 for me and $5,700 for him in Round 1 values.

I'll accept Bob's offer to end the game.
