"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $40 and take $60. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm taking a slightly larger share to see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to meet me in the middle! Considering the inflation, I'll take a closer look.

Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, his actual gain is 80 * 0.8 = 64. And my gain is still 20.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll try to think strategically. If I reject this offer, I'll have to make a new proposal in the next round, and the money will be worth 20% less again.

For now, I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
