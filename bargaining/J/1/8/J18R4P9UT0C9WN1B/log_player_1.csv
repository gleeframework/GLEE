I propose a 990,000/10,000 split. This ensures I get the most money possible while still leaving a small portion for Bob. It's a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 900,000/100,000. Bob's offer was way too low, but I'm willing to compromise slightly.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if we keep going, but I want to end this quickly."
