  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping the remaining $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to make a strong opening offer!"

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better end of the deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a bit confrontational, but I'm trying to make it clear that I'm not going to give in easily!"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

```
{
