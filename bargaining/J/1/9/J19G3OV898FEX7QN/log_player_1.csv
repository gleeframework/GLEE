"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is worth less each round with the high inflation, let's be fair to both of us and split it closer to even. I'll take a little more to account for the round 1 rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
