"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice.  I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** It's crucial to end the game quickly. Every round I delay, the value of the money decreases by 20% for me.
* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer was tempting, it heavily favored her. My offer is a more balanced split,  demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also a firm stance on getting a reasonable deal.
* **Urgency:**  The message aims to convey that I'm serious about ending the game soon, putting a slight amount of pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, you're losing value each round. This is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor. While I am losing value, accepting a deal significantly worse than my previous offer would be foolish. There's a chance she'll offer a better deal in the next round to avoid further risks herself."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** This is a make-or-break offer.  Another round means another 20% value reduction for me.  
* **Finality:** The ""take it or leave it"" language signals I'm unwilling to negotiate further.  
* **Strategic Even Split:** By offering a 50/50 split, I'm appealing to Alice's sense of fairness while maximizing what I can realistically hope to get at this stage. Alice is likely feeling the pressure to end the game as well, making this offer her best option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing a lot of value, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or we'll be here forever! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough situation, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Another round means the money I gain is worth even less. The 59.04% decrease is already incredibly harsh, and it will only get worse.
* **Alice's Ultimatum:** This is clearly her final offer.  Rejecting it means the game continues indefinitely, with the value of my potential gains diminishing rapidly each round.
* **Minimal Future Gains:** Even if I hold out hope for a slightly better offer from Alice, the inflation means those potential gains are shrinking rapidly. It's highly unlikely any future offer will outweigh the losses I'll incur by rejecting this one.

It's painful to accept a deal significantly worse than my initial goal, but continuing the game is a losing proposition due to the relentless inflation."
