"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gain as $4000 * 0.8 = $3200. 

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather have more money in the long run, considering the inflation effect. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation (80% of 80% = 64%), I'll aim for a higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm taking a bigger share this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gain for me. Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value due to three rounds of inflation, I'll consider the effective gain as $5800 * 0.848 = $4915.60.

I'll accept this offer because it's a better deal than my previous offer, and I'd rather have some money now than risk waiting for a potentially better offer in the next round.
