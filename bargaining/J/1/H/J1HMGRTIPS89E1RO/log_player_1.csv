"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll think it's a good starting point and we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $200,000 (10% less than $700,000)
* Bob gain: $640,000 (20% less than $800,000)

I don't think this is a good deal for me, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
