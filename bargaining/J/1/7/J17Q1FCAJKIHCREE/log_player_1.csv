"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I need to consider that when evaluating this offer.

After accounting for the inflation, I would gain $4,500 / 0.8 = $5,625 in the first round's money.

I think this offer is better than my previous one, but I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the second round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to do better. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 42% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 58%."
