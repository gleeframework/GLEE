Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, let's meet closer to the middle before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that the value is decreasing, she's still heavily favoring herself in this deal.  I need to signal that I'm willing to risk it all going to inflation to get a more equitable split. We're past the halfway point, so the pressure is on."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer - it's slightly in my favor, but it's the best you'll get at this point.  Any more stalling and we'll both be fighting over scraps.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the value of the money is plummeting. I need to apply pressure and signal I'm serious about not accepting a bad deal.
* **Shifting the Blame:**  By framing it as ""this is getting ridiculous,"" I'm putting the onus on Alice for the continued decline in value.
* **Slight Edge, but Acceptable:**  This offer is still tilted in my favor, but the slight edge is necessary to incentivize Alice to take it now rather than gamble on getting a better deal later (which is increasingly unlikely)."
