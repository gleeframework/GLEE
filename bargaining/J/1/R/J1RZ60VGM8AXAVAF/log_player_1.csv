"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to split the money evenly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 50-50 split. The money is still worth the same for me, but for Bob, it's worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less from the first round, and 10% less from the second round), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is adjusting his offer to account for the increasing inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can still do better than this offer. The money is worth the same for me, but for Bob, it's worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 37.1% less for Bob now (10% less from the first round, 10% less from the second round, and 17.1% less from the third round), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```

This offer takes into account the increasing inflation and the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is reverting to a 50-50 split again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been negotiating long enough, and the decreasing value of the money for Bob is starting to become significant. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
