Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk, meet me here or we both lose 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, Alice is clearly getting more desperate as the rounds progress and the value diminishes.  Her offer is getting worse for her, which means there's potential for me to gain more if I continue to play strategically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic.  You drive a hard bargain, but we're running out of time. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. Take it or leave it - this is my final offer.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on for both of us.  The money is losing value fast.
* **Strategic Matching:** By mirroring Alice's previous offer structure (slightly better for me), I signal a willingness to compromise but also firmness.
* **Finality:**  Stating it's my ""final offer"" adds weight and might push Alice to accept rather than risk getting nothing."
