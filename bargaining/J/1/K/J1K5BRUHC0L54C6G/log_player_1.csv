"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, given that the money will depreciate more for me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to affect the value of the money.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least some gain, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
