"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90 dollars and giving Bob 10 dollars. I believe this is a fair initial offer, as it ensures I receive a majority of the money while still giving Bob a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it is a slight increase from his previous offer, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I will try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering Bob 15 dollars this round, while taking 85 for myself. While this is a slight decrease from my first offer, I believe it's necessary to incentivize Bob to accept.  With the increasing inflation, we both need to be more flexible."
