Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate due to the inflation heavily impacting her potential gains. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, she's still valuing her share significantly higher than mine.  I'm willing to bet she'll concede further in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real.  The inflation is killing your share. This is a fair 50/50 split, take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is significantly hurting Alice, and she needs to realize that holding onto a larger share isn't beneficial if the value keeps plummeting. A firm 50/50 offer emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the fairness of the split, especially given the circumstances."
