"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with only $1.  This is a very aggressive move, but I believe it's the best strategy in the first round.  Since I'm not losing any value from inflation, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing even more money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  Bob's offer is still significant, and with each passing round, the value of his offer will decrease for him. If I reject this offer, there's a chance I might end up with nothing in the next round.  It's better to take a decent amount now than to risk losing everything."
