It's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Even if I don't get more money, the inflation will make the 3000$ less valuable later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept. I have to consider the inflation. While I'm not getting my desired amount, the 5000$ is better than the 3000$ I was offered in the first round, and I don't know what the future holds with Alice."
