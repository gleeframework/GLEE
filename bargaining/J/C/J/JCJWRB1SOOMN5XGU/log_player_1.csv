"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  It's a fair starting point, considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 to myself and 300,000 to Bob.  This is a fair compromise after Bob's last offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. It's becoming clear that we're getting further apart, not closer. I'm going to stick to my demands and see if Bob will budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering 600,000 to myself and 400,000 to Bob.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but this is a fair offer considering the time we have left.  If Bob continues to reject, he risks getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's closer than before, we're running out of time. I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement where I get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. With time running out, it's the fairest solution that gives us both a significant amount.  We need to be realistic about the declining value of the money, and this offer ensures we both get something rather than risking getting nothing at all."
