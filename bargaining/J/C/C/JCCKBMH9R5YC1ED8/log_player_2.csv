"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get something to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a mere $1,000.  It's a small amount to start with, and I'm hoping for a better deal.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split. It's a fair starting point for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, this offer is significantly better than my previous one. I don't want to risk losing even more due to inflation, so I'll accept."
