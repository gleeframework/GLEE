This seems like a bad deal for me (Bob).  While a 60/40 split might seem fair in a normal situation, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds.  I'll make a counter-offer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is definitely trying to use the inflation to her advantage. While her offer is better than the first one, it's still not favorable enough considering the rapid devaluation of her potential gains in future rounds. I need to incentivize her to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This offer heavily favors you considering the inflation. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me hard, need a better cut 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting ridiculous. While I understand the inflation is hitting Alice harder, her demands are becoming unreasonable. It's highly probable that she's hoping I'll panic as the deadline nears and accept a bad deal. I need to hold firm, but a slight adjustment to my offer might be necessary to show some flexibility."
