"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems ""reasonable"" on the surface, Alice gets a much larger share, and the inflation rate means I'll lose out more than her in the long run. I'll try to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We both lose value over time, so a 50/50 split seems fairest.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! Let's settle this. I'm taking a small hit from my previous offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  Even though she's taking a small hit, it's not enough to make up for the fact that she's taking a much smaller percentage of the loss than I am. I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but a 50/50 split is still the fairest solution. The longer we wait, the more money we both lose.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant amount of money. This is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is right, we're losing a lot of money with each round. While I still prefer an even split, this offer is closer to what I would like, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too high. I'll accept it."
