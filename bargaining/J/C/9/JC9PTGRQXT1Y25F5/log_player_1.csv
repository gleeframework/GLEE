"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on before inflation significantly impacts my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I am losing value due to inflation, I am still confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round.  Bob's offer is far too unfavorable for me to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm proposing a 75/25 split in my favor. Even with inflation, this offer is still advantageous for me, and I believe it is fair enough for Bob to accept, considering his significantly higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While the inflation has eroded a significant portion of the value, Bob's offer is now the most advantageous for me considering the combined impact of inflation on both of us."
