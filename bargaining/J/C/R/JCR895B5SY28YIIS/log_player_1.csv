"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a first round offer. I'm being generous by keeping the majority for myself, but I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer. I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm not sure how it will affect Bob's decision. I want to see if he values getting something now or waiting for a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair. The inflation has reduced my potential gains significantly, and it's unlikely I can get a better offer in the next rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent share of the money, rather than risking getting nothing at all."
