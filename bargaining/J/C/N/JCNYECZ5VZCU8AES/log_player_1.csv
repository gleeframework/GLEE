"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%. Let's see if Bob will accept or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's a very lopsided offer! Bob is trying to take a huge chunk of the money for himself. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a bit more balanced than my previous one, but still slightly favors me. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
