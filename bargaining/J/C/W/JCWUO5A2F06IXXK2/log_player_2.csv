Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable, as I'm losing less value each round.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point. How about a 51/49 split? This accounts for the inflation difference while still being a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
