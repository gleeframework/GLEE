**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While her offer is slowly inching closer to a more even split, I need to hold my ground a little longer to make her sweat.  The rate of inflation is decreasing, so the difference between rounds will become less significant."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, 50/50 is not the best you can do 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being incredibly stubborn and seems content to let the clock run down.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing in a few more rounds. Accepting now cuts my losses and ensures I at least get something from this negotiation."
