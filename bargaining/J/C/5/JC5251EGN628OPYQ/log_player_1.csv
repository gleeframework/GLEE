Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. It's a fair and equal division, but I'm willing to negotiate if you're not satisfied with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
