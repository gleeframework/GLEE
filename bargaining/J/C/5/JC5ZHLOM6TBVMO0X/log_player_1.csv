"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money ($999,000), but still leaves Bob with something ($1,000).  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a very uneven split, or if they prefer to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more than 500,000, the inflation factor is making each round riskier.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount of money, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing to negotiate."
