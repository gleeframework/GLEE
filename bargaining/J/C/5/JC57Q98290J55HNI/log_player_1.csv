# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and proceed to the next round. The decreased value of the money due to inflation will be considered in my next proposal.\n\n###\n\nLet's move on to Round 3!"
