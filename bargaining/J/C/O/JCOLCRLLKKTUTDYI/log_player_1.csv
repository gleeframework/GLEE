I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. Since we're playing a game, I'm aiming for a larger share, but I'm also trying to be fair. It's important to note that the inflation will be in effect next round, so I'm keeping that in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Bob's previous offer was too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to a more equitable split. While I'm aware of the inflation, I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances."
