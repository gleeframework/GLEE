"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob such a large share of the money, especially since the value of his gain is already decreasing due to inflation. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping for a better deal, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. Considering the effects of inflation, I think I should be more cautious with my acceptance. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob such a large share of the money, especially since the value of his gain is decreasing significantly due to inflation. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, Bob! 50-50 split?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and a 50-50 split seems like a fair and reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
