"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to accept, but this is just the first round. I want to see what Alice will offer in later rounds, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round.  I might be able to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the money will be worth less next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer above 50%. Take it before inflation hurts us both even more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I offered, and with each passing round, the value of the money keeps decreasing.  It's time to settle for a good enough deal before we both lose more."
