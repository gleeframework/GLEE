"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing so rapidly, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, I don't want to give up too much either.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
