Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each round.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller net gain, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share and seems unlikely to agree to a deal where I receive significantly more than him. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable amount of money. Rejecting it carries the risk of Bob offering even less in subsequent rounds, pushing us towards a less favorable outcome for me."
