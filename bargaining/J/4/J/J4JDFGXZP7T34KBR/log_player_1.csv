"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you get 40. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 20 is actually worth 18 dollars (10% less than the original 20 dollars), which is a pretty small amount.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll ask for a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve more after your last offer. I'll take 80, you get 20. Will you accept?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm not giving up control. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. My gain of 10 is actually worth around 7.3 dollars (27.1% less than the original 10 dollars), which is a very small amount.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large share, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
