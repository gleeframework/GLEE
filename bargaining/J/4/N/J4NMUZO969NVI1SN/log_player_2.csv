"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $70, you take $30.  Time is money, Bob, and it's depreciating fast! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the money now, I want to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation is a big factor, and I think I can get a larger share with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm offering you $40, which is more than your initial offer, and I'll take $60.  Let's start moving towards a more fair split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, that's not how this works.  My turn, and the clock is ticking.  I'll take $65, you get $35.  This offer won't get better! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject. While the inflation is a concern, I'm confident that I can get a better deal with a few more rounds.  Alice's offer is still not very fair, and I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if we can find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to find a split we can both agree on.  I'm offering you $30 this round. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject. Even though the inflation is starting to get serious, I believe I can still improve my share. This offer is a little better than the previous ones, but I'm not convinced it's the best we can do.  Let's keep playing!"

{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, but I'm still hoping we can reach a fair agreement.  I'm offering you $25 this round. This is a substantial increase from your previous offer and a compromise that we can both benefit from.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous!  We're both losing out because of your stubbornness.  Fine, $55 for me, $45 for you.  Take it or leave it - but time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject. While the inflation is definitely biting now, I believe I can still get a more favorable split. This offer is a slight improvement, but I think we can do better. Let's see if we can reach a more balanced solution in the next few rounds."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is insane! We're both heading towards zero at this point. It's $50/$50, take it or we BOTH lose! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a larger share, the inflation is getting out of control, and I don't want to risk losing everything. A 50/50 split is fair, and at least we'll both walk away with something."
