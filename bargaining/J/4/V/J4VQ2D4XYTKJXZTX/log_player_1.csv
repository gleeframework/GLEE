"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I'm taking the lion's share in the first round, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8800 
# Bob gain: 1200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation makes it risky to reject. I'm not sure how much Bob is impacted by the inflation, but 8800 is better than risking it all."
