Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, but the value is decreasing significantly with each round. While this offer is closer to a potential compromise, accepting now would reward her inflexibility. It's riskier, but holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is still the stronger strategy."
