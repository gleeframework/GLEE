Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer considers the inflation impact on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is fair considering the inflation. Let's close the deal and avoid losing more money! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, time is becoming a factor. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob.  Continuing to push for a slightly better deal makes sense. If Alice doesn't budge in the next round or two, it will be time to accept a less favorable split to avoid getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair split, especially considering the accelerating inflation.  Let's close it out.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The game is at a turning point. Offering a 50/50 split shows Bob is willing to compromise, but also sets a clear bottom line. This accomplishes a few things:

* **Fairness:**  Given the inflation disparity, an equal split at this stage is actually advantageous to Bob in the long run.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need to settle quickly before inflation erodes more of their potential gains. 
* **Possible Acceptance:**  Alice is likely getting desperate. While she might have hoped for a larger share earlier, a 50/50 split might be the best she can get at this point."
