"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take a quarter of the money, the inflation rate is very high for me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the inflation rate is high for me, I need to secure a larger share to make the most of it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Alice's offer.  Even though I'm getting a smaller share than I proposed,  the inflation rate is seriously hurting my gains.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all."
