"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by proposing a slightly unfair split in my favor. I figure Bob will likely reject this, and then I can offer something more reasonable in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  I'm not sure how much longer Bob will be willing to negotiate.  It's better to accept this offer and get some money than risk getting nothing at all."
