Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20-80 split, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
