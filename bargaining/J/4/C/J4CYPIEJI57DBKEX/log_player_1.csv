"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split given the inflation.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less than half, but still a fair share""}\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects this offer.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 20% less for me again this round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.)\n\n###\n\nAlso, please clarify the current worth of the money for me after two rounds of inflation. Is it 64% of the original value (80% * 80%) or is it calculated differently?"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again.
