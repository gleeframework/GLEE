{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer.  While I would get a larger share than Bob offered in the previous round,  it's still significantly less than I'd like. I believe I can do better by continuing the game and making my own offer in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

With only a few rounds left, the pressure of inflation is mounting. I'm making a significant concession by lowering my share, offering Bob a larger portion in hopes of reaching an agreement. I believe this offer is fair considering the potential for both of us to get nothing if we fail to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is now having a significant impact on my potential gains, and with only a few rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing is too high.  A 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances."
