"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

This way, Bob gets the majority of the money, and I get a decent chunk as well. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting even less in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
