Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 72/28 split. This maintains a balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money. Let's aim for a fair division. 
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72
