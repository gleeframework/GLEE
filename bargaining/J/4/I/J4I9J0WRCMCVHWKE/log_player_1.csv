# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less each round for me, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 72 
# Bob gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth significantly less for both of us, I'll try to get as much as I can. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting again.
