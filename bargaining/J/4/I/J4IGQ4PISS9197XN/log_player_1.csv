"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a division of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping this is fair enough to get us started and avoid too much back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
With inflation, my share is worth less, and Bob's offer is a significant improvement over what I was initially proposing.  Let's take it."
