"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn for the lion's share. Think about the decreasing value! Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to give you more, but I still need a significant portion to make this worthwhile.  Time is running out!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm meeting you closer to the middle, but this is my final offer. The clock is ticking and the money is losing value, especially for you! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, and Bob's offer is closer to what I was aiming for.  While I'd prefer more, I need to consider the inflation and the dwindling time."
