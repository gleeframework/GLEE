"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. You'll still take a hit from inflation, but not as big as you wanted. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
