Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to a deal. This offer is my final compromise - let's end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

At this point, the inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of Alice's potential gains. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, accepting ensures Alice receives a reasonable sum. Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the following rounds is too risky, as the value will continue to decrease, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer more favorable terms."
