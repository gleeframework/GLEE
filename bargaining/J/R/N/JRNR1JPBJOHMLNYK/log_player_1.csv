"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
