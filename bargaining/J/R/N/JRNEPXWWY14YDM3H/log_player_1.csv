"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, avoiding any inflation risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal. Even though the inflation rate is 20% for Bob, his offer is still less favorable to me than my initial offer, especially considering I have no inflation. I'm willing to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9500, ""bob_gain"": 500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, hoping to incentivize him to accept. While the inflation rate is affecting his gains, I'm still in a stronger position due to no inflation on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8500 
# Bob gain: 1500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not as good as my initial proposal, even with the increased inflation rate. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9750, ""bob_gain"": 250} 
```

I'm raising my offer again, trying to find a balance between maximizing my gains and reaching a compromise. I'm hoping this higher offer, combined with Bob's increasing inflation, will make this deal more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8800 
# Bob gain: 1200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Despite the high inflation rate, Bob's offer is still not as good as my initial proposal. I am confident that I can get a better deal with more rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9875, ""bob_gain"": 125} 
```

I'm taking a bold move here. I'm pushing the limits of what I'm willing to offer Bob while still considering his inflation. With only a few rounds left, he's likely to feel the pressure and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, with only 4 rounds remaining and Bob's significant inflation,  there's a high risk of getting nothing at all. It's better to secure some gain than risk losing everything."
