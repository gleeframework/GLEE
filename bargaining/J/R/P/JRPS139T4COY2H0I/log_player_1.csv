"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering I was initially willing to give Bob a smaller share. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split for me""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with the 45/55 split. I was hoping to get closer to 60/40, and I'm not willing to give up that much more. I'll try to make another counteroffer to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a decent share of the money while still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
