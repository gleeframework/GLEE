"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I don't like losing out on so much money, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all. The inflation is significantly hurting Bob's potential gains more than mine, so there's a good chance this is his final offer."
