Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the attempt at a fair start, Alice. However, I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself this time.  Let's see what you think.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating at our potential gains. I'm aiming for a more balanced approach this time. Let's not let greed get the best of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is trying to take a more ""balanced"" approach that actually favors her. While her offer is better than her first, it's still under the 50/50 split.  I need to push for a better position while the inflation penalty on her side is still growing."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more stalling and we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous.  While I could try to push for a slightly better outcome, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point, especially considering the inflation working against Alice."
