"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the current value of the money for both Alice and Bob after inflation.
For Alice, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round. Since this is the third round, the money is worth 95% of its value from the previous round, which in turn was 95% of the original value. So, the value for Alice is 100 * 0.95 * 0.95.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Since this is the third round, the money is worth 80% of its value from the previous round, which in turn was 80% of the original value. So, the value for Bob is 100 * 0.80 * 0.80.

### Step 2: Calculate the actual value of the money for Alice and Bob in round 3.
For Alice: 100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 90.25.
For Bob: 100 * 0.80 * 0.80 = 64.

### Step 3: Decide on a proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money and the need to reach an agreement before the 12 rounds are over.
Given that the value of money is decreasing more significantly for Bob than for Alice, and considering Bob's previous offer was a 40-60 split, Alice could try to negotiate a bit more in her favor but still aim for a relatively fair split to encourage Bob to accept before the money's value drops further.

### Step 4: Formulate the proposal.
Alice decides to propose a split that is slightly more in her favor than the previous offer from Bob but still acknowledges the need for a compromise. She offers 55 for herself and 45 for Bob, with a message encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle before it's too late!""}"
