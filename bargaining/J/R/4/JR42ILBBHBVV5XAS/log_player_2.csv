"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair distribution while also providing a substantial amount for you. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's proposal is technically ""fair"" in terms of the ratio, the 3:1 split is heavily in her favor. Since we have 12 rounds and the money loses value each round, it's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution considering the potential for inflation in the following rounds. Let's work together to ensure we both get a good share of the money.""}
