Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money.  I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll take it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more money, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, inflation will significantly reduce the value of my potential gains in the next round.  It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."
