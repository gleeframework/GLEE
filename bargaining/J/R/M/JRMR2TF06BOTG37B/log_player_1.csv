Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 in my favor is a fairer starting point.  It's still a good split, but accounts for the fact that we're both taking a risk by rejecting the first offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
