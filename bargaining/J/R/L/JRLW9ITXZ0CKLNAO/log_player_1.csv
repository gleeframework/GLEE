I'm going for a big chunk, but I'm leaving Bob with something to consider. Let's see if he's happy with that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is getting too greedy! I'll make him regret that offer."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer, showing him I'm willing to negotiate but still want a larger share. It's a risk, but hopefully, he'll see the value in ending the game now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is getting ridiculous! This is way too low. I'll stick to my guns and make a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I've had enough of this back-and-forth. It's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers. I'm going for an even split, hoping Bob is tired of playing as well."
