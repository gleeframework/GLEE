"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully. Since Alice's offer is slightly better than my previous offer, and I don't know how Alice values the money, I'll accept this offer.
