"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and taking 60 dollars for myself. I'm trying to be generous while also keeping in mind that the money is worth more to me in the early rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to me now, I'd be getting less value than I would have in the first round. I think I can do better, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nSince the money is now worth 20% less to me than it was in the first round (10% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm offering Bob 45 dollars and taking 55 dollars for myself, which is closer to the even split he proposed in the previous round. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
