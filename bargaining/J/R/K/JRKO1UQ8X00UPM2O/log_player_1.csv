"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing we take a larger share upfront to capitalize on the decreasing value. This offer gives you a guaranteed $350,000, a decent sum considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Game:**  The key here is the decreasing value of the money for Alice. This means waiting is highly disadvantageous for me (Alice). 
* **First Offer Strategy:** I want to incentivize Bob to accept a deal now rather than later. Offering him a reasonable sum upfront achieves this.
* **Why This Split?**  While I am aiming for a larger share, I need to make the offer appealing enough to Bob. Starting with a 65/35 split feels like a good balance between maximizing my gains and ensuring Bob doesn't see it as too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can both do better than your offer.  Since the money is losing value, let's aim for a fairer split that gives us both more now.  This proposal guarantees you a substantial sum while still giving me a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message sounds appealing, the math doesn't add up in my favor. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  My share is now worth 20% less, significantly impacting my potential gains if I accept his offer.
* **Unfavorable Split:** Bob's offer of a 40/60 split heavily favors him. Accepting this would mean losing a significant portion of my potential earnings, even considering the inflation. 

**Strategy Going Forward:**

* **Counter Offer:**  In the next round, I need to make a counter-offer that is more balanced while still factoring in the decreasing value of the money.  I need to convey the urgency of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a fair share, but the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. My offer gives you a guaranteed $450,000, which is a considerable sum. Let's finalize this now and avoid further losses for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Balance:** I need to move closer to a compromise while still prioritizing my share. This offer is a significant adjustment from my previous one, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing Urgency:** My message highlights the time-sensitive nature of the situation. By reiterating the impact of the decreasing value, I hope to persuade Bob to accept a deal now.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** I want to prevent the game from dragging on, as each round significantly diminishes my potential gains. This offer aims to be attractive enough to Bob while still securing me a reasonable portion of the money."
