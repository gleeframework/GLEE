# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I think we can both do better than your offer.  Since the money is losing value, let's aim for a fairer split that gives us both more now.  This proposal guarantees you a substantial sum while still giving me a significant share.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair share, but the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. My offer gives you a guaranteed $450,000, which is a considerable sum. Let's finalize this now and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
