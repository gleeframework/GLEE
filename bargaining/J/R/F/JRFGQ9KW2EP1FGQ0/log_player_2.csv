Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm also aware of the decreasing value.  Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair and gives us both a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to hold on to a very favorable split, even with the decreasing value.  I need to signal I'm willing to play hardball to get a better deal."
