Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but the longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me. This offer is a compromise, taking both our positions into account. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
