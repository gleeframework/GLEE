"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest considering the inflation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is a factor, but your initial offer was too low. This is a much fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than his potential offer in the next round, it's still skewed in his favor.  Given the faster rate of inflation for Bob, I have a stronger negotiating position as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This offer is a compromise, but time is money - literally in this case.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It's a decent split considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is running out.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer now guarantees a better outcome than risking another round. 

Here's why:

* **My Inflation:** My value decreases by 5% each round.  Another rejection means my potential gain in round 5 is worth even less.
* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob called this his ""final offer,"" suggesting he's feeling the pressure of his rapidly devaluing money and might be more agreeable in the future.
* **Unknown Future:**  There's no guarantee I can get Bob to agree to a better split in the next round. 

Accepting now secures me 6000, which is a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
