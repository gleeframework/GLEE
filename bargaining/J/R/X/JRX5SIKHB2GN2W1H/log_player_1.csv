"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, but I'll try to do better next time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of 50/50 split. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move on."
