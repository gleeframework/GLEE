Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take the majority, you get a decent start.  What do you say?

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for such a lopsided deal in the first round! I'm going to see what I can get in the next round when I get to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split.  I'm willing to give you a good share, but I also need a decent amount to work with. This is a good starting point for negotiation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be more flexible, but I still need a larger share to cover my losses from inflation. Let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with the split, and I'm confident I can do better.  This is a big jump in what Alice is offering, but it's still not fair. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
