Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as I'm giving him $1, and I get the rest. Since this is the first round, the money won't be affected by inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
