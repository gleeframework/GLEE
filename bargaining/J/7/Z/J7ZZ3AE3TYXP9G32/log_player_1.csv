"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's be reasonable!""}

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm also trying to convey a sense of reasonableness and cooperation with my message. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split.  This is more equitable, considering the inflation we'll face. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI don't think this offer is fair, especially considering the inflation. I was willing to give Bob 40% in the first round, but now he's offering me 40% after the money has already lost value? I think I can do better than that. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split now.""}

I've taken into account the inflation and reduced my initial offer, but I still think I should get a slightly larger share since the money is losing value faster for me. I'm trying to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm aware of the changing circumstances. Let's see how Bob responds!"
