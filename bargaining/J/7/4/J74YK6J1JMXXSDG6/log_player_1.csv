Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, Alice. How about we make this a bit more appealing for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,

""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking and inflation is eating away at your potential gains.  This is a good deal for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob's gains are eroding quickly.  While he might be hoping for a better deal, the longer this goes on, the less appealing his potential gains become. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal (like 55/45) carries the risk that Bob might propose an even worse deal later on. A 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable outcome. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a limited number of rounds, the pressure to reach an agreement increases.  A 50/50 split now avoids the risk of getting nothing later."
