"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 60-40, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, it's fairer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

In the first round, I would have gotten $60, but due to 20% inflation, that's now worth 80% of $60, which is $48. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, which is 80% of $50 (since Bob's offer is $60, which is 90% of $66.67, but I'll get 80% of $50).

Since I'll get $40, which is less than $48, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing that I get $36 and Bob gets $64."
