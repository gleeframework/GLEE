"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: $40 × 0.8 = $32
* Bob gain: $60 × 0.8 = $48

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
