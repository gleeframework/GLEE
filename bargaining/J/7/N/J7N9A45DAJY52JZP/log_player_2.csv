Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Here's why I reject:

* **Time is on my side:** Inflation is hurting Alice more than me. Each round makes her offer less appealing from her perspective, pushing her towards a more favorable deal for me.
* **Alice is getting desperate:** Her message (""Come on, meet me in the middle!"") suggests she's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot.
* **Holding out for a better deal:**  I can still aim for a better split than 42/58, especially as the game continues."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing pressure:** Alice is feeling the heat of inflation more strongly now. By Round 4, her potential gains have shrunk considerably in real value.
* **Projecting firmness:** By calling this my ""final offer,"" I'm aiming to signal that I'm not going to concede much further. This might nudge Alice to accept, fearing I'll be even tougher in subsequent rounds. 
* **Still a reasonable gain:** While this offer is less than my Round 2 proposal, it's still a significant improvement over accepting Alice's offers. It reflects a balance between maximizing my gains and ensuring Alice is likely to accept before the shrinking pot makes it too unappealing for her."
