"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with 40%, or $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to flip the script. Let's go with 65-35,  your turn next! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I don't think 35% is a good deal for me, especially considering the initial offer was 60-40 and now it's 35-65. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You flipped the script, now it's my turn to adjust. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the current value of $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and leaving Bob with 45%, or $450,000."
