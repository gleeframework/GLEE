"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
