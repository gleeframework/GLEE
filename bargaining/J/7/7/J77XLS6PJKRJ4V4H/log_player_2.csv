Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer we wait, the more our share is impacted by inflation. It's time to show Alice we're serious about getting a better deal, but we need to act fast before inflation eats away too much of our potential earnings."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Don't let greed cost us everything.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play strong.  Offering a 50/50 split accomplishes several things:

* **Fairness:**  It eliminates any argument about greed or advantage-taking.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the shrinking pot and the danger of delaying further.
* **Potential Acceptance:** While Alice has been aiming for a larger share, the increasing inflation might make her reconsider risking a worse deal later."
