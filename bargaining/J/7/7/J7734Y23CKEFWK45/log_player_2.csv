Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair deal. Let's split it evenly and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
