I'm going to be greedy and try to get the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm losing 20% of the value of my money, I'm still going to try to get a better deal. I know Bob is being greedy, and I'm hoping to convince him to be a little more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, while still keeping a larger share for myself.  I'm hoping that after two rounds of rejection, he'll be more inclined to compromise."
