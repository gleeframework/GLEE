"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80 dollars and leave 20 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the effective gain as 80 * 0.8 = 64 dollars for me and 20 * 0.95 = 19 dollars for Bob in the first round.

In the second round, Bob's offer is 70 and 30, which is a good deal considering the effective gains. I'll accept this offer.
