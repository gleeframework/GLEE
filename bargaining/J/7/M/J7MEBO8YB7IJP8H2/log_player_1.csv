I'm going to try and maximize my share while making sure Bob still gets something, hoping he'll accept the offer. Since his money depreciates much faster, I'm confident he won't risk waiting for a potentially better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than the previous round, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  Even with the inflation, my money is worth more than his, and I'm confident I can get a larger share if I reject."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm raising my share again, aiming for a more balanced split. While Bob's money is depreciating much faster, I'm being generous enough to make him an offer that he might be willing to accept."
