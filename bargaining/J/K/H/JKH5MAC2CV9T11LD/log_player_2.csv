"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting $4,500 now is a poor deal compared to what I could potentially secure in later rounds if I play strategically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  I need to push for a larger share immediately to offset the 5% inflation that will eat into my potential gains each round.
* **Strategic Offer:** Offering Alice $4,800 is still a reasonable sum, and she might be tempted to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later.
* **Time Pressure:** My message subtly reminds Alice that delaying benefits her more than it benefits me. This might push her towards a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were generous, now it's my turn to be bold 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  Her offer is significantly worse than her initial proposal, and the inflation makes it even less appealing. I need to hold firm and aim for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest solution.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  After two rounds of back-and-forth, it's clear that Alice is also playing strategically. Offering a perfectly even split is a strong signal that I'm serious about a fair deal. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the potential gains decrease for me. A 50/50 split, even with some inflation factored in, is better than risking a worse offer from Alice in the later rounds or walking away with nothing.
* **Appeal to Logic:** By framing it as the ""fairest and fastest"" solution, I'm appealing to Alice's logical side and emphasizing that dragging this out only hurts us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 idea inspired me, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to lowball me now. A 60/40 split in her favor is unacceptable, especially with the significant impact inflation has already had on my potential earnings.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal, and not desperate enough to accept a bad one."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Let's be realistic -  accept this and we both walk away with something decent.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  While I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, I need to acknowledge Alice's advantage and the time pressure. Offering her slightly more than me might be the key to ending this standoff.
* **Firm Stance:**  Calling it my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and signals that I'm not willing to be pushed around further. 
* **Focusing on the Positive:**  Highlighting that we ""both walk away with something decent"" emphasizes the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement now, before inflation eats further into the potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I think you can do better 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is blatantly trying to exploit the situation.  She's ignoring my previous offer and attempting to pressure me into accepting a terrible deal. I need to stand my ground. Accepting this would set a dangerous precedent and likely lead to even worse offers in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My previous offer was more than fair.  I'm returning to it one last time - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I need to stay strong. I'm re-offering my previous split of 47/53, which is already a compromise on my ideal 50/50.
* **Strong Language:**  I'm dropping the niceties and being very direct about my frustration. This is no longer a friendly negotiation; Alice needs to understand I'm serious. 
* **Ultimatum:** By stating ""take it or leave it,"" I'm drawing a clear line in the sand.  This might be my last chance to secure a semi-decent deal before the inflation makes continuing pointless."
