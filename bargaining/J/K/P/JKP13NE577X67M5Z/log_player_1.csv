Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to start. This way, he might be tempted to accept, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation affecting me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, I'm taking a hit from inflation. It's better to accept now and get half of the money than risk getting nothing if we continue."
