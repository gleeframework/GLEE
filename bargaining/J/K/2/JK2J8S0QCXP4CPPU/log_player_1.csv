Let's see if Bob is willing to take a tiny piece of the pie. I'm aiming for a high share in the first round, knowing the money will decrease in value for me with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's getting late in the game and the money I'd gain is decreasing rapidly. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least half of the original amount, which is a good deal considering the diminishing value."
