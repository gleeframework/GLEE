"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. After all, the inflation might make that single dollar worth less for him in the future!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all due to the inflation."
