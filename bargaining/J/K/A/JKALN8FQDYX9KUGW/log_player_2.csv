"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a classic game theory scenario. While it's tempting to accept even $1, it's worth considering the future rounds.  Rejecting allows Bob to propose a split in the next round and potentially get a much larger share.  The risk of inflation is a factor, but the potential reward is too big to ignore."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'll take 90% now, and you can have the remaining 10%.  It's a much better deal than what you offered me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still holding most of the value. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the offer is better than the previous round, it's still incredibly lopsided.  The inflation makes it tempting to accept, but it's better to hold out for a more equitable share.  Alice is clearly trying to push through a deal that is highly favorable to her.  Rejecting gives Bob the chance to propose again in the next round and potentially get a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's split it 60/40.  It's a fair deal that benefits us both, and we can finally end this game.""
