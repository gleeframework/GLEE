"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose we split the money 900,000 for me and 100,000 for you. I think it's a fair start considering we have a long way to go before the money starts losing value too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept the offer. Even though it's a lot less than what I initially proposed, the inflation is going to start eating away at the value of the money very quickly. It's better to secure half now than risk getting nothing."
