"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's still a fair starting point considering the inflation dynamic. 
Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair and equal split.  Since the money loses value for both of us in future rounds, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy to avoid losing everything."
