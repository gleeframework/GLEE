"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not getting a good deal. I was hoping for a more generous split, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Time for a 50/50 split, let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation and the previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a slight improvement over my previous 50/50 proposal. With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm willing to settle for a slightly lower share to get the game over with."
