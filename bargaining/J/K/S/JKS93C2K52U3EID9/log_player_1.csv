"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large share (9000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller amount (1000$). It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, this offer is still significantly better than getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation.  It's a good deal, considering the risk of further rounds."
