"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 55% and you take 45%""
}
```

This way, I'll get $550,000 and Bob will get $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, but you can have 40% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I don't think I'll accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. The value of the money has decreased, and I'd like to get a better share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. Take 51% and I'll take 49%""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
