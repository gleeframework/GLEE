"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would receive is 20 * 0.95 = 19.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round. Since I rejected the offer in Round 2, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm offering Bob 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and I'll take the remaining $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount I would receive if I accept Bob's offer from Round 4. The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would receive is 10 * (1 - 0.1426) = 8.57.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 4.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual amount I would receive is 5.74% of the initial $100. To calculate this, I'll multiply 5.74% by the current value of the money, which is 100 * (1 - 0.1426)^4 â‰ˆ 73.22.

To make a new proposal, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the current value of the money. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65
}

I'm offering Bob 65% of the current value of the money, which is $65.20, and I'll take the remaining $7.02."
