"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob. This way, I maximize my gain in the first round and secure a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me $20, which is better than risking getting nothing in future rounds due to inflation."
