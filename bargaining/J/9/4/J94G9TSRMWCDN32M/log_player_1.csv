"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is 50-50, which is a good split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 10% less than in the second round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to take 55 dollars, which is a slightly higher amount than Bob's previous offer, while still leaving a decent amount for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth significantly less than in the first round, and the split is 45-55 in favor of Bob. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I need to prioritize getting a higher percentage of the remaining amount. However, I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob.
