Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers still favor her significantly.  While the difference seems smaller, remember the real value of her share is plummeting due to inflation. I'm betting I can push for an even better deal in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I'm offering a perfectly even split. Take it before inflation eats away any more of your share. This is your best chance!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going for a strong, fair offer here.  

* **Time Pressure:** Time is running out for Alice. The longer this goes on, the less her share is worth.  
* **Shifting Advantage:** By now, Alice should realize her negotiating position is getting much worse with every passing round.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Offering a 50/50 split makes me seem fair and might make Alice more likely to accept rather than risk a worse outcome by being greedy."
