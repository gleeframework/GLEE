**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses a significant chunk of the potential gain due to inflation. It's worth taking a risk and countering one last time. If Alice isn't receptive to a counter-offer in the next round, Bob may need to seriously consider accepting a less favorable deal to avoid walking away with nothing."
