"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. I'll get the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept the offer, and we can finalize the division of the money."
