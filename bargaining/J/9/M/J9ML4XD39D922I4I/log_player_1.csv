Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take 90% of the money in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which is fair. Even though I lose 5% of my gains due to inflation, it's better than risking getting less in future rounds."
