"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, as I'm taking the risk of the money losing value each round. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up that much, considering the money is still worth the same for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more balanced split considering the inflation risk. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for compromise."
