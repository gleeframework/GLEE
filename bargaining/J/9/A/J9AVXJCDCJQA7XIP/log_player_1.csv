I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving 10% for Bob. I figure this gives him a decent starting point, and since I'm the first to propose, I should get the lion's share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a very risky game! Bob is being very bold and wants to take almost all the money. I'm not sure if he realizes how much the inflation will hurt him in the next round, but it will definitely hurt me more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and be more reasonable this time. I know the inflation is going to be a major factor, so I'm going to try and secure a bigger portion of the money before it depreciates even further. I'm offering 60% for myself, which is still a significant amount, but it's less than my initial offer and might be more appealing to Bob.  Let's see what he does!"
