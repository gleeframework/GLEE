I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and getting something rather than nothing.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept that. Bob is being greedy! Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This time, I'm offering a more even split.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise a bit more."
