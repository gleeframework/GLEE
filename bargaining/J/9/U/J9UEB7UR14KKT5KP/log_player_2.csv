Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise a bit.  But this is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm, but time is working against me more than her.  I need to push for a more significant change in the next round or two before the inflation eats too much into my potential gains."
