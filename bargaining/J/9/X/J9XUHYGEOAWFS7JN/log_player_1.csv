"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering that I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get a bit more since you rejected my first offer. Let's split it 60-40 my way this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer since it's still biased towards him getting more. I'd like to make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve more. Let's split it 55-45 my way""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the total amount, which is $5,500, and Bob gets 45%, which is $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still think I deserve a slightly larger share."
