"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 40$ in this round is actually worth less than my gain of 80$ in the previous round. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit stingy, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to the 20% inflation twice, I'll aim for a more aggressive split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's split it evenly!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be a fair deal considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the additional inflation, the money is worth even less, and Bob's offer is a bit more generous than his previous one. I'll consider it. Since I was aiming for a 50-50 split, this offer is slightly better for me, but I'm not sure if I should take it.
