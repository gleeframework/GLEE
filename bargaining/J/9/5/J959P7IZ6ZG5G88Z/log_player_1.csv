"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is fair considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob claims fairness, his offer heavily favors him, especially considering the rapid inflation working against him. It's highly likely he'll be forced to propose a much better split in the next round to avoid losing a significant chunk of his potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money. This is my final offer - let's close this deal and both come out ahead.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob's inflated losses put increasing pressure on him to accept a deal.  
* **Finality:**  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling I won't be swayed further, adding pressure on Bob. 
* **Appears Reasonable:**  While still in my favor, the offer is generous enough (especially considering inflation) to be palatable to Bob, preventing him from taking a ""nothing"" gamble on future rounds."
