**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Inflation is eroding the value of the money significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal for Alice.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for Alice (60-40, then 55-45, now 58-42). It's unlikely he'll suddenly offer a more generous split.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks Bob proposing an even smaller amount for Alice in the next round, making the current offer seem more appealing in retrospect.

While accepting 42 isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome by continuing to play the game."
