"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer for you to start with, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept an unfair deal right away.  Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, Alice.  Let's split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share this time.  If you accept, we can move on.  If not, we'll see what happens in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'll take $65, and you take $35.  This is your last chance for a reasonable deal, because the clock is ticking on that inflation! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not fair, and the inflation is making her offer worse.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's find a compromise.  I'll take 60, and you can have 40. This is a fair deal considering the inflation, and we can finally end this game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous! The pot is shrinking with every passing second. I'm offering you $30 - take it or leave it! This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfair. While the pot is shrinking, I'm not going to accept such a low share.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting out of hand. The money is decreasing rapidly. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game before we both lose everything. It's the most reasonable option at this point.""}
