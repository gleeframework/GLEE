45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to be fair, Alice.  Let's split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share this time.  If you accept, we can move on.  If not, we'll see what happens in the next round.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's find a compromise.  I'll take 60, and you can have 40. This is a fair deal considering the inflation, and we can finally end this game.",Bob,4,
