Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000

This is a tough one, but I'll accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  Bob is right, time is running out, primarily for him. However, every round that passes without a deal hurts both of us to some degree.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could push for more in Round 5, the potential gain might not outweigh the risk of Bob's offer decreasing further in subsequent rounds. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** Bob is taking a significant hit from the inflation, making his offer of $575,000  a reasonable compromise at this stage."
