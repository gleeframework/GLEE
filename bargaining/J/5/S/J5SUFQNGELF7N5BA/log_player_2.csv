**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is making increasingly smaller concessions. It's still early in the game, and I'm aiming to secure at least 55% of the money."

Round 7

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing.
* **Inflation:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, but it's unlikely she'll accept an offer much lower than this.  Delaying further significantly favors me, but a 50/50 split is a fair compromise.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing carries the risk of miscalculating and getting nothing."
