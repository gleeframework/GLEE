Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** While I lose 10% of my gains, Bob loses 20% of his. This means his offer is relatively worse for him than it is for me.
* **Fairness:**  The offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting the offer means going to another round, where I could potentially get less money.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.

Therefore, accepting the offer seems like the best option for me in this situation."
