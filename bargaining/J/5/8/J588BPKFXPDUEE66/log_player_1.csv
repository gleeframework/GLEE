"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a higher share this round, but I'm not budging much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a bit better than the previous one. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll aim to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced purchasing power.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to keep up with inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a fair split given the current market conditions 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on our earnings! With the reduced purchasing power, $5,500 is worth only about $2,800 in real terms.

While I'm not thrilled with the offer, I think Bob is being more reasonable this time around. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll have to swallow my pride and accept this offer.
