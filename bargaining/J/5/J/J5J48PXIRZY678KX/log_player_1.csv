"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant share of the money, but I'm keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less and less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a bit more even than my previous offer. However, I'm still not sure if I want to give up that extra 1000$. 

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is eating away at the money, so I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll get a larger share of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. I'm getting less than I initially wanted, but the money is worth less in general, so it's not as bad as it seems.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
