"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I think I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  It's still a good deal for you, and it leaves more for me.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear Alice isn't budging.  It's better to take the 45% now than risk getting nothing at all."
