  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve the majority of the cash.""

# Alice gain: 4000

Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I need to think carefully about the offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up so much, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle... of my previous offer! Let's try again.""
}
```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk and effort. Let's meet in the middle-ish.""

Considering Bob's new offer, I realize that the numbers are quite close to my previous offer, but with a slight shift in Bob's favor. However, I'm not willing to give up more than I did before, considering the decreasing value of the money. I decide to reject this offer as well.

# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, I think I can get a better deal than that 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! I'm getting extremely desperate now, and I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering Bob's new proposal, I realize that he's pushing for an even more significant share of the remaining amount. However, I'm not willing to give up more than I did before, considering the decreasing value of the money. I also think that if I accept this offer, I'll be left with an amount that's worth almost nothing in real terms.

I decide to reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more than I did before. I think I deserve a fair share, considering the risk and effort. I'm starting to think we're not going to reach an agreement.""

}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option at this point. My message is a bit more forceful, and I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to accept any other terms."
