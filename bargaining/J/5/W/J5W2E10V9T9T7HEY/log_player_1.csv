I propose a 90/10 split. I'm taking a big chunk, but since we only have 12 rounds, I want to get as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower split than in Round 1, but I still want to get the majority of the money. We're losing 20% of the value each round, so I need to secure as much as I can quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  While I'd like more, the money is decreasing in value so rapidly that I need to take what I can get."
