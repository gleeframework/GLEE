**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold firm for a little longer. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the money due to inflation. I'm betting she'll start to get nervous as we get closer to the deadline."

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I need to be realistic. The value of the money is plummeting with each round. Accepting this offer gets me something, whereas continuing to hold out risks getting nothing at all if Alice continues to play hardball."
