I reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation impact is much greater for Alice, and I'm not sure that split is fair in the long run.  I want to see how the game plays out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a 5500/4500 split.  This takes into account the inflation impact more evenly than your offer.  Let's get this game going!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the uneven inflation impact, I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While Alice still gets a larger share, the inflation is hitting her much harder, and with each passing round, the value of my share keeps dropping.  It's time to end this game."
