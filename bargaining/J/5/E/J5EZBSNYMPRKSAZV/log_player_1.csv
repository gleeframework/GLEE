"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! 70% is a fair share, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can end the game and avoid further inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'd be getting 500,000 dollars, which is 95% of the original 525,000 dollars I would have gotten if the money didn't depreciate.

I'm not thrilled about meeting Bob halfway, but it's a decent offer considering the circumstances. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
