"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 700k and you get 300k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great offer for me! My gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'd be getting $700,000 - 5% = $665,000. Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'd be getting $300,000 - 10% = $270,000.

I'm not happy with this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. 55-45 split. Is this more to your liking?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small token, but I'm still not convinced this is fair 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gain! My gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting $700,000 - 14.26% = $601,630. Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less, so he'd be getting $300,000 - 27.1% = $218,500.

This offer is still quite one-sided in Bob's favor. I'm not thrilled about it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate. 45-55 split. Is this the best you can do?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive with this offer, but I'm still hoping Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal."
