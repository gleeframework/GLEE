"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split, let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The 20% decrease in value for me is significant, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than 40 dollars. Let's proceed to the next round where I'll make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more balanced offer. I'm willing to take a bit more due to the higher depreciation on my end.""}\n\nSince the value of money decreases by 20% for me and only 5% for Alice with each passing round, I've adjusted the proposal to reflect this imbalance. By offering 55 for myself and 45 for Alice, I'm attempting to compensate for the greater loss in value I incur with each rejection, while still presenting a relatively fair split that might entice Alice to accept, given the lesser impact of inflation on her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, I think we both need to compromise to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, with a 36% decrease in value compared to the first round, accepting a 50/50 split at this point seems like the most reasonable decision. The offer is fair, and further rounds would only continue to diminish the value of the money I could gain, likely leading to a scenario where any increase in share would be offset by the loss in value. Alice's message about compromise to avoid further losses resonates, as it's clear that prolonging the game would be counterproductive for both parties."
