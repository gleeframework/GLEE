"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 90$ and let Bob have 10$.  This is a pretty good starting point for me, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's less than I wanted, it's still a decent amount, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round with the inflation."
