"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 in this round is actually worth $400,000 compared to the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the fact that I'm getting less than I did in the first round, but Bob's offer is fair, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
