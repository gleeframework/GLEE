"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit greedy, aren't you? I'll give you a small chance to change your mind. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to reassess my gain.

I don't think I'm being greedy, but I'm willing to consider a better offer. However, I'm not thrilled with the 20-80 split. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle this time. Your turn!""
