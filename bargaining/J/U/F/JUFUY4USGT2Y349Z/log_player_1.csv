"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to maximize my gain in the first round. This offer leaves Bob with a small amount, but it's better than nothing if he accepts. If he rejects, I'll have to be more strategic in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While Bob has reversed the roles, the offer is still very lopsided. I'm willing to wait and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement in later rounds. The inflation may even work in my favor if Bob's gains decrease further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to make a slightly less aggressive offer this time, aiming for a 90/10 split in my favor.  Bob rejected my initial offer, so I need to be more reasonable, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking further inflation and potential losses in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob has reduced his share, it's still very lopsided. I'm confident that with more rounds, we can reach a more fair agreement. It seems like Bob's share is decreasing due to inflation, so I'm going to wait and see if that trend continues."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going for a 70/30 split this time. Bob's share has been decreasing due to inflation, and I'm starting to think he might be more willing to accept a more balanced offer. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm being more flexible this time."
