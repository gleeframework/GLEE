Let's see what Alice will propose next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

Let's see if Alice likes my proposal.  I'm hoping to secure a good amount for myself while still giving Alice a reasonable share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Alice's offer.  While I'm getting less than I hoped for, the inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. It's better to take something now than risk getting nothing."
