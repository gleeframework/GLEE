Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try 60/40.  I'm willing to give up some of my share to avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I'll reject Alice's offer again. Although she's willing to give up some of her share, I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation is affecting both of us, but it's affecting me more, so I'm motivated to end the game soon. However, I don't think 40% is a fair share for me, considering we're already in the third round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me in the next round."
