"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. This seems like a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is meant to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to be reasonable. This is the best offer you'll get with the inflation looming. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer seems reasonable, I'm not convinced it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, I'd like to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts both of us. Let's split fairly.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Given the inflation, I believe this is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too. The message ""Inflation hurts both of us. Let's split fairly"" is meant to emphasize the impact of inflation on both of us and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance for a decent deal. Inflation is eating our money! 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the money's value, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. The difference between our proposed splits is relatively small, and I don't want to risk losing even more value to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer and settle for $487,500."
