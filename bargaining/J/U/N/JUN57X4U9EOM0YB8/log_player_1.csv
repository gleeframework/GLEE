# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to make sure I get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Let's end this game.

# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with my decision.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the significant decrease in value for both of us, I believe I can still get a better deal.
