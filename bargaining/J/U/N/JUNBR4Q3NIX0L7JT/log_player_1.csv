"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:\n\n

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

In this offer, I propose that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000, with a message suggesting a fair split to start the negotiations. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, but I need a bit more.  This offer is better for me in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain but not mine. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split""
}
```

In this offer, I propose that I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200, taking into account the inflation that affects Bob's gain. The message explains my reasoning for this split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  The value will only decrease further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant effect of inflation on Bob's gain and the fact that my gain remains unaffected, I think a 50/50 split at this point is indeed a fair deal. I accept Bob's offer to end the game."
