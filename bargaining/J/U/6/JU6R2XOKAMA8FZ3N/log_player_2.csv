"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm not sure I'm ready to accept a 40/60 split just yet.  Let's see what other options are available."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Alice. 50/50 seems like the most equitable way to divide the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was fair, Bob, but let's be practical - we both lose money with each round. I propose a slight adjustment in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a 50/50 split, I'm aware the value of the money is dropping with each round.  Accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all."
