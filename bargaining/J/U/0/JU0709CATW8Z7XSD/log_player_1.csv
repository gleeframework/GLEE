Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think 60/40 is a bit too much in your favor. How about we do 55/45? It's a more even split, and we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Plus, remember that the money is worth 10% less with each passing round, so let's not drag this out too long! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
