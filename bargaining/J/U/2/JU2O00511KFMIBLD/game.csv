60.0,40.0,Let's start fair! I propose we split it 60/40.  We can always adjust later if needed.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It reflects the slight advantage I have due to the faster inflation rate on your side. Let's make this quick and get the money!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's be reasonable.  We both lose money with each round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get something.  What do you say?,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
