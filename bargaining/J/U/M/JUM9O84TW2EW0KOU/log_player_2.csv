Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 80%, and you get 20%.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it avoids further inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000
