"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about splitting it down the middle, but it's a relatively fair offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
