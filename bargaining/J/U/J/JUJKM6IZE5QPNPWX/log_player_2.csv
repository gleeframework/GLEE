"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  I know inflation is a factor, and I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than 50/50. I'm willing to give you 40% of the pot, but I'll need the rest to account for inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need a bit more for myself to account for the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would like more, I'm worried that if I reject this offer, Alice will be the one to propose next and inflation will make my share even smaller. Accepting this offer gives me a decent share despite the inflation, and it ends the game."
