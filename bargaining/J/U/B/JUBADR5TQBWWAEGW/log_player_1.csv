"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by being generous and offering Bob a small portion of the money.  This is to see if he's willing to accept a small share early on or if he'll hold out for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not a great deal, accepting this offer is the best option.  Inflation is a real threat, and I can't be sure how much it will affect Bob's future offers. Getting 100,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing later on."
