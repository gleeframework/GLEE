"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you half, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too generous, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```

{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not 50%""

I'm trying to balance the fairness with the reduced value of my gain due to inflation."
