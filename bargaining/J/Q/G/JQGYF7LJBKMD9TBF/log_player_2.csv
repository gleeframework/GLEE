"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice is offering a very uneven split right off the bat. I'm not convinced this is a ""reasonable"" offer, and I want to see what she'll do if I push back.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable split. This proposal reflects a more balanced approach, acknowledging the time pressure we're both facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we both lose with each passing round.  This offer is fair and leaves us both with a substantial sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first, it's still not a fair split considering the time pressure we're both under.  I'll continue to push for a more even division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution that works for both of us. This offer is a compromise, reflecting the shared risk of letting time run out. Let's agree on a fair division before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we're running out of time. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than reasonable considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is still not ideal, but we're running out of time. Accepting this offer ensures we both get something, and the potential for further negotiation is now very risky.  I'll take it, but I'm not happy about it."
