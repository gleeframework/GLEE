"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm thinking of getting the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give you the majority just yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3,200. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of its original value as well, which is $4,800.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite fair, Bob. I'm still looking for a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain will be worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2560,
  ""bob_gain"": 7440,
  ""message"": ""I'm still looking for a good deal, Bob. This is my revised offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much ground yet. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,800 is now worth 51.2% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512), which is approximately $2,964.80.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I'll take it. This is a decent deal, considering the inflation.""
}
