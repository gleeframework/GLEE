"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle this time. I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation much more than I am. While her offer is better, it's still skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, knowing that each round makes the money less appealing to her."
