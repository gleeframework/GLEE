I propose a split of 90/10 in my favor, as I am the first proposer. I think this is a fair initial offer, considering the possibility of inflation."

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is simply too low, even considering the enormous inflation on Bob's side. It's better for me to get nothing than accept this.  There's a chance Bob might change his mind, but I'm not willing to take such a small amount."
