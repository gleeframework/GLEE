I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming to get the money quickly. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less now, I can still potentially get more if I keep playing. I need to see if he'll be willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to decrease my offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that the inflation will pressure Bob into accepting a fairer deal."
