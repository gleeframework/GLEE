"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a smaller share last round, now it's my turn to make a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth $540,000, and Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth $380,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
