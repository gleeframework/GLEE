"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'll lower my initial offer slightly to 80 for me and 20 for Bob.  This is a more balanced split, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly skewed in his favor, and the inflation is hitting him harder now. I need to keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to secure a decent amount.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that the inflation is hurting him more than me, and we can reach an agreement before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I would consider fair, but I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting him much harder than me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm willing to concede further to 60/40, hoping Bob will see the risk of getting nothing at all.  The inflation is now significantly impacting him, and I think he needs to start taking the risk of getting nothing more seriously."
