"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 in a 4:1 ratio, with you receiving $20. This way, we can ensure a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures we both get an equal share, and as the money is losing value for me, I'm not willing to accept a smaller portion. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
