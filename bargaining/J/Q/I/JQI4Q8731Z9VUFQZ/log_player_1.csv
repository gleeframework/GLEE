Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This is a fairly generous offer, but it still leaves me with a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
