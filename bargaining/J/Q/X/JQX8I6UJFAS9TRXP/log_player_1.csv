"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm taking the risk of proposing 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd receive are:

* My gain: $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53
* Bob's gain: $6,000 / 0.9 = $6,666.67

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
