"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and leaves Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 550,000 is worth 95% of the initial 800,000 I was hoping for, so it's a bit of a loss for me. But it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
