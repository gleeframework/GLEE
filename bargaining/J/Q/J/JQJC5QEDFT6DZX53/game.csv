6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose we take $6,000 and you take $4,000. It's a good deal for a quick agreement.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation is hurting you more than me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is working against me, so my offer from Round 1 is off the table. How about we meet in the middle - $5,500 for me, and $4,500 for you?  We both benefit from settling this sooner rather than later.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Inflation is taking its toll on your share, Alice. I think it's only fair I get a bigger cut. Let's settle this before it gets worse for you.",Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm adjusting my offer slightly, but I need you to meet me halfway. $5,200 for me and $4,800 for you. Let's end this before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, you're losing value with each passing round. I'm willing to take a bigger share to end this, but I won't go lower than this. Consider the inflation and think about the future rounds.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's time to be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now. This is my final offer.  If you refuse, you're gambling on getting a slightly larger share while risking getting nothing at all. Don't be greedy, Bob.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"Alice, your 'final offer' wasn't as final as you thought. With inflation eating away at your share, I'm willing to take an even bigger cut. You should consider accepting this before it gets worse.",Bob,8,
