Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is decreasing, but yours is getting worse with inflation. Let's meet in the middle - 65/35. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The value is slipping away with every round. I'll be generous and offer you 450,000.  Take it before it shrinks even further!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns, but I'm giving you a chance to grab a larger share while it's still worth something. 62.5/37.5, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Value:**  The value of Bob's potential share is rapidly decreasing. He's already lost almost 60% of the initial value due to inflation.
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice's offers have been getting progressively worse for Bob. It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a significantly better deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer in the hopes of a slightly better deal in later rounds is too risky. The potential loss from further inflation outweighs the potential gain of a few more percentage points. 

While 37.5% isn't ideal, it's better to secure something now than risk getting even less later.
