"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob something to hopefully secure his acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better offer considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to offer me a good chunk of the money. It's a good deal for me at this point."
