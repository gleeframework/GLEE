"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going for a slightly unfair but not outrageous split in the first round. I want to see if Bob is willing to play ""fairly"" or if he's going to try to squeeze out more for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting this offer. While I'm not expecting a perfectly even split, this is way too lopsided. It's clear Bob is being greedy and isn't interested in a fair division. I'm going to try to counter-offer and show him I'm not afraid to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split this round. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise or if he's going to be stubborn and risk getting nothing."
