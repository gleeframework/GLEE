Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4800

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds left, the looming threat of getting $0 each becomes increasingly significant. The rapid devaluation makes each round critically important. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the negotiation drags on, the less valuable the potential winnings become. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now might be better than risking a worse outcome later.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's ""final offer"" message suggests he might be less willing to negotiate further. Pushing him further risks stalemate and a complete loss.

While Alice ideally wanted a larger share, accepting $5200 now, even with the 48.8% inflation, is better than the potential outcome of receiving nothing."
