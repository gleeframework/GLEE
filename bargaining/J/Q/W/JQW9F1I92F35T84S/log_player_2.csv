"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to secure a deal due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a good starting point, but I believe I can get a better deal, especially since the inflation rate is hitting Alice harder.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I believe this split is fairer given the current inflation rates, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation rate significantly impacts my share.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. This offer is a compromise, and I believe it's in our best interest to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is impacting Alice more severely, and this offer represents a significant compromise. It's in my best interest to accept and secure a deal before the value of the money drops further."
