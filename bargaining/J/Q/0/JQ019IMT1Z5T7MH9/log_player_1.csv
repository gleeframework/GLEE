"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think I can accept this offer. Bob is taking a significant advantage, and I'm not willing to give up $2,000 more than I would have in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not that much!""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a balance. I'm willing to give up $500 more than in the first round, hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise."
