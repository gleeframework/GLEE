"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting with a stronger offer. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $60 from the first round is now worth $57 (95% of $60).

Bob's offer is $20 for me, which is worth $19 (95% of $20).

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's still better than nothing. I'll accept.
