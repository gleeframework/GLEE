"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start, a fair and simple way to begin. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  I'm willing to give you a little less, but I'd like a little more for myself.  Let's see if we can find a way to agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think 60/40 is a fair compromise. Let's see if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd like to get more, it seems like Alice is firm on her offer. Accepting now means I get at least something, and the inflation is making things worse with each round."
