"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting an offer of just $1000 out of $1,000,000. That's not a fair split! I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, 40% for me, 60% for you.""}\n\nI'm making a more reasonable offer, giving Alice the majority share but still getting a decent portion for myself. Hopefully, this will be more acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still deserve a larger share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer since Alice is willing to compromise and give me a larger share than before. It's still not a 50/50 split, but it's better than the previous offers. I don't want to risk getting a worse offer in the next round, so I'll take this one.
