"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 20% less, I think this offer is a good one for me.
