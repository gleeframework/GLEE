"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. I'll take the lower amount, you can take the higher amount. We can call it a day.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a lower amount, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's try again. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer, since I can get a better deal than this in future rounds. The money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, so I'm not motivated to settle for less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again!

Considering that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me. I'll take a bit more, but it's still a fair deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the previous offer, taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about compromising. I'll try to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, since it's a fair compromise and I don't want to risk going to another round. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less due to inflation. I think it's a good time to call it a day.
