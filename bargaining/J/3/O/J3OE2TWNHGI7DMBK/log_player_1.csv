"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming to get the majority, knowing that the money will be worth less to Bob in later rounds. Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob's offer is better than his first one, I still believe I can get a larger share. I'm willing to gamble that Bob will cave in later rounds to avoid losing out entirely."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm lowering my demand slightly to make it more tempting for Bob. Let's see if this is enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer.  Even though it's lower than my ideal, the inflation is really starting to hurt Bob's side of the deal.  It's risky to keep going, as the money keeps losing value for him.  I think this is a good compromise."
