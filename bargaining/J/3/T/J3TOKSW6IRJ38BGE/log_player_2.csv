Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share. I'm proposing a compromise that's slightly more in my favor considering the inflation disparity. This is a fair deal for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
