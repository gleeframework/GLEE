"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\n(Note: I've decided to offer a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a proposal that gives me a slight advantage.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll evaluate the offer considering the inflation. With 20% less value, the $4500 offered to me is actually worth $3600 in terms of the original value. Given this, I don't find the offer favorable enough, especially since Bob's gain remains unaffected by inflation. I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please let me know how Bob reacts to my rejection."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my offer to try to find a mutually acceptable division. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to compensate for the loss in value.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this offer. I'm trying to negotiate a better deal while taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, the pot is shrinking for you. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in the fourth round, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. This means the $5500 offered by Bob is actually worth approximately $2826 in terms of the original value. Considering this significant decrease in value and Bob's message stating this is his final offer, I must weigh the options carefully.\n\nGiven the substantial loss in value due to inflation and the risk of further devaluation if we continue, I've decided it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. Continuing the game risks further diminishing the value of my potential gain, and this offer, despite being less than ideal, provides a certain outcome.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've chosen to accept Bob's offer, concluding the game. The division will be $5500 for me and $4500 for Bob, according to the terms of the offer in round 4."
