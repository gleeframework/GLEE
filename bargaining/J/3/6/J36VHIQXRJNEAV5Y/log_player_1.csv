I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  It's a fair starting point, and hopefully Bob will see the value in accepting it early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob is being greedy! While he's offering me a larger amount, it's still significantly less than what I initially offered him. I'm not going to let him get away with that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. This should be a more appealing offer for him, especially given the inflation.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in settling now before the money becomes worth even less for both of us!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too stubborn!  Even with inflation, I'm not going to settle for such a low share.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  After all this back and forth, it's time to be reasonable.  We both have lost a lot of money due to inflation.  Let's just divide the remaining amount fairly."
