7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair distribution while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This acknowledges your initial offer and the decreasing value of the money for me. I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.,Bob,2,
