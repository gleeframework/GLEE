Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a bit too even-handed for my taste. I'd rather have a slightly larger share to account for the risk of future rounds.
