"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both have to play the game. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I'm not sure if I want to give up 55% of the remaining money so quickly. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm looking forward to making a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's compromise and finish the game soon!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,700 and keeping $6,300 for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and ending the game quickly."
