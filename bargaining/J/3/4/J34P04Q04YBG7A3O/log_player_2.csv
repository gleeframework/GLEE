**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split in her favor. While time is running out, accepting a bad deal just because of inflation isn't the best strategy. There's still a chance to negotiate a better outcome, even if it means accepting slightly less than ideal in the later rounds."
