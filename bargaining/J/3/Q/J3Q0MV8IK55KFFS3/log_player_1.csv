"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor that will kick in later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is still quite even, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
