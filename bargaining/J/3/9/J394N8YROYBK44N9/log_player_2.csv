"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly Bob. 70 for me, 30 for you. It's a fair offer considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. With the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, I don't think 70-30 is a fair split at all! It's too skewed in Alice's favor. I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's be more fair, 55 for you, 45 for me. Inflation is coming!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer. 65/35, take it or leave it. We're both losing money with each round! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think this is the best deal I'm going to get. The money is worth less with each passing round, and Alice's offer is slightly more generous than before. I don't want to risk losing even more value, so I'll take the 35 dollars and end the game here. It's not the best outcome, but it's better than taking an even bigger loss in the next round."
