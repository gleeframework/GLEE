"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  I'm keeping 90% and giving Bob 10% to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is simply reversed, and while the money is worth less for both of us due to inflation, it's still significantly more beneficial for him. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but I'm still offering a significant portion to Bob, hoping to find a compromise. The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to secure a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the inflation is making his offer worse and worse for me. While it's painful to lose a lot of money, I'm confident I can do better than this. I need to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share to myself again, but I'm still aiming for a fair split.  Bob's greed is escalating, and the inflation is becoming a serious issue.  I need to find a way to settle before we both lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed is getting out of hand, and the inflation is making his offer even worse for me. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal.  The clock is ticking, but I'm not giving up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. Bob's offers are getting more and more unfavorable with inflation, but I'm also feeling the pinch. Hopefully, this offer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give up everything."
