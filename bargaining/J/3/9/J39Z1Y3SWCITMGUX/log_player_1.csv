"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of the original amount.

In this round, the money I gain (300,000) is worth 90% of the original 600,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is 270,000. The money Bob gains (700,000) is worth the same as in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous rejections, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I'll get a slightly higher share, but still leave room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gains for me in this round. The money I gain (400,000) is worth 73.9% of the original 600,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately 439,400.

Considering this, I'll decide to accept the offer.
