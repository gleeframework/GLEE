"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 45%."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth significantly less for me now, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems more balanced, but I'll have to consider the inflation effect.
