I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, keeping in mind that the money will be worth less in future rounds. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the future due to the inflation. Accepting this will give me a decent amount, and it's better than getting nothing after 12 rounds."
