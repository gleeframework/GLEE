"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, and keeping $80 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we can both walk away with something! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after the first round, Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is more attractive to me now.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
