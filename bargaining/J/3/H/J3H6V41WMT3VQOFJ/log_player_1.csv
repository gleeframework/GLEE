"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it rather than risk getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I still think I can get more in the long run. While the value of money is decreasing, I have a good chance of getting closer to my ideal split if I continue to play."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway,  offering a slightly higher share for him than my previous offer.  I think this will encourage him to accept, but still gives me a good portion of the money."

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm realizing that inflation is having a bigger impact than I expected.  I'm still confident that I can secure a more favorable deal if I continue to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8200, ""bob_gain"": 1800} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer than my previous one, but still a higher share for Bob than my initial offer. With the increasing rate of inflation, I need to be more careful with my offers and be willing to make concessions.  However, I believe this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. The inflation is getting serious now, and my ideal split is looking less and less likely. But I'm going to stick with it. I'm still confident that I can secure a more favorable deal if I continue to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7800, ""bob_gain"": 2200} 
```

Inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share than my last offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Hopefully, Bob will realize that the value of the money is dropping quickly, and he'll be more willing to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting really close to my bottom line, and I'm feeling the pressure of inflation.  But I'm still going to reject it. I'm hoping that Bob will start to feel the pressure too, and that we can reach a compromise that is fair to both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share again. I'm starting to get really worried about the inflation, but I'm hoping that this offer will finally convince Bob to accept. We are running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. The inflation is really biting now, and the offer is significantly lower than what I originally hoped for. However, with only 2 rounds left, the chance of getting a better deal is slim. It's better to accept this offer and secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
