"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more this time, as the money is losing value. Let's see if we can reach a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is losing value, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55% is a fair compromise given the inflation.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal."
