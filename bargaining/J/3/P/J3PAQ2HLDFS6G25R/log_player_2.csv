"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer. While it seems fair, I know there's inflation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time, as the money is losing value. Let's see if we can reach a compromise!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55% is a fair compromise given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept the offer. While it's not as much as I wanted, the inflation is taking its toll and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
