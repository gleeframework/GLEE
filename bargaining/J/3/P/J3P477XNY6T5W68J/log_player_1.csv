"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 10% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a decent one, to see if he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept it. I think I can do better than 20% of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can end the game sooner.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less, which means I need to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, and I'm not getting a better deal.
