Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but ensures you get a good chunk right away.

# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a fair deal, but the inflation hits me harder. Let's meet in the middle - this still gives you a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
