"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time.  I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money. This is a good deal, let's wrap it up.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it down the middle.  I think we're both tired of this game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While I could try to push for more, Bob's offer is now fairly reasonable.  The longer this goes on, the less his share is worth to him due to inflation, making my negotiating position weaker. Accepting a 50/50 split now is a safe bet to ensure a reasonable gain."
