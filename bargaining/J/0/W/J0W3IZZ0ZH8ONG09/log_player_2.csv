"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is working against you, but your previous offer wasn't quite fair considering I'm taking on more risk. This offer is a slight adjustment in my favor, but still allows you to secure a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
