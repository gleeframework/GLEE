"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $50 is worth 5% less than my gain in the first round, so I'll receive $50 * 0.95 = $47.50.

I accept this offer.
