"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing a 2:3 split, where I take 400,000 and Bob takes 600,000. The message is just a friendly reminder that we can keep things simple and split it evenly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than an even split. This offer gives you a good share and leaves more for me. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This way, we both get a slightly better share than before.""}

I'm proposing a 4:6 split, where I take 420,000 and Bob takes 580,000. The message is an attempt to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground."
