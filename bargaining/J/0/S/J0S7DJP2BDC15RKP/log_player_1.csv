"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a better deal.  By rejecting this offer, I get to make the next proposal and I can take advantage of the fact that Bob's gains are worth 5% less now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm offering a split of 81/19 in my favor. Even though my gains are worth 10% less than in the first round,  I still believe I can get a better deal than Bob's offer.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While his offer is higher than the previous round, it's still not enough to make up for the inflation I'm experiencing.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal by making the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm offering a split of 72.9/27.1 in my favor. This offer is still better than Bob's previous offer, even with the inflation. Hopefully, he'll accept it before we get to the point where inflation makes it impossible for either of us to get a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed I'm only getting 300,000, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Accepting this offer will give me some money to work with, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get anything better if I continue rejecting."
