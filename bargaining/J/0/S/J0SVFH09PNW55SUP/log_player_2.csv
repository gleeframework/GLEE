"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25:75, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but slightly more in my favor. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 28, ""alice_gain"": 72}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 31 
# Alice gain: 69 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is still a 69:31 ratio, which is closer to my desired ratio, I'll accept this offer.
