"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 50/50!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to give away the whole thing 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I would only get $200,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial offer. I'm looking for a more equitable split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that's better for me than the previous offer, but still gives Bob a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the whole thing, again 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The reduction in value due to inflation is significant, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $300,000. I'm looking for a better deal, and I'll reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing that I get $350,000 and Bob gets $650,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that's better for me than the previous offers, while still giving Bob a significant portion of the money."
