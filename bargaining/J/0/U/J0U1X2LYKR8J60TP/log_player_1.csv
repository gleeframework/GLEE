"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I think it's a good way to begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% loss due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept the offer for now, as it's a 50-50 split. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise.
