"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to try and get a better deal than 40. I'll try to propose a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect us differently.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I still think a 60/40 split is fairer, I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing."
