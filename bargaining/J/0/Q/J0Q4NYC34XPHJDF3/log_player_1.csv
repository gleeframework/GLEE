"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, a 3:2 split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
* Bob gain: 60

I'm not too thrilled about the 3:2 split, but it's a compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
