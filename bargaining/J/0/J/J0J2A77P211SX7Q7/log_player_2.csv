"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and I'll take 90%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""That's a very generous offer, Alice, but I think we can find something a bit more equitable. How about a 65/35 split in my favor?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. Rejecting it was essential to signal that I'm aiming for a fairer division.
* **Counter-offer:** My offer is still tilted in my favor, recognizing that I have more to lose from inflation as the game progresses. 
* **The message:**  I'm starting with a relatively strong offer but maintaining a polite and somewhat playful tone to keep the negotiations amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 625000,
""alice_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice! I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle on a 62.5/37.5 split?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a fair split, accepting 60/40 now would mean I've lost a significant chunk of potential gains to inflation. It's worth pushing a little further.
* **Counter-offer:**  I'm reducing my demand slightly to show flexibility but maintaining a firm stance above the 60/40 split. 
* **The message:** I'm acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate while making it clear I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome. Keeping the tone positive and encouraging further compromise is key."
