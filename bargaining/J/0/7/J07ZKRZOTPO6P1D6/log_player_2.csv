"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. It makes sense to settle now rather than risk losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair share, but time is working against us. I'm proposing $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a good deal considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
