"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I need a bit more due to inflation costs. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know I'm taking a hit from inflation, but I'm willing to take that risk to get a better deal. Meet me in the middle or we'll keep playing. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and trying to frame the situation as a ""risk"" for him. However, the inflation is steadily working in my favor.  He's offering me significantly less than my starting offer to him. I need to hold strong and aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, the longer we wait, the worse it gets for you. I'm offering you a deal that's still fair considering the inflation. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting desperate:** His offers are getting worse for him, indicating he's feeling the pressure of inflation. 
* **Show strength:**  I'm increasing my demand to take advantage of his desperation. He might be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer now than before.
* **Time pressure:** By framing this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer, I'm putting pressure on him to make a decision quickly."
