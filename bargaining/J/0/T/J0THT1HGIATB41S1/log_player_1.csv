"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9,000 for myself and giving Bob $1,000. This is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept. I'm aware of the inflation, but I'd rather secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation makes taking a lesser share in this round a better option than risking getting even less in the next round. This offer is a fair split, and I'll accept it."
