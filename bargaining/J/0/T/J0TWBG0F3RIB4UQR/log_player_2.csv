"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a middle ground. My offer is a slight compromise from the previous round, but I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. It's crucial to remember that she doesn't experience any inflation. My bargaining position weakens with each round, while hers remains constant. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to play further and am seeking a more balanced outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  This offer reflects the time pressure and acknowledges the need for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's seal the deal and avoid further losses to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I am proposing a 52.5% / 47.5% split in Bob's favor. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, inflation eats into Bob's potential gains.  A deal needs to be reached soon.
* **Fairness:** While a 50/50 split seems intuitively fair, Bob is operating under a significant disadvantage due to inflation. This offer is a compromise. 
* **Closing the Deal:** Alice's offer in Round 3 suggests she's willing to negotiate.  This offer might be tempting enough for her to accept, avoiding further risk and delay."
