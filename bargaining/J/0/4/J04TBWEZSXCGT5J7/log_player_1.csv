"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to settle for it."
