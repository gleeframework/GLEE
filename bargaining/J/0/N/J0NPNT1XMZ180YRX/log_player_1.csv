"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money equally. This way, we both get a good share, even considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer seems reasonable. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up the advantage of potentially getting more in later rounds. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to split it equally yet. Let's see what happens in the next round.""

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000
