Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one last chance. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The value of waiting any longer is getting perilously low. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 yields a better outcome than rejecting and risking an even worse deal (or nothing at all) in a potential Round 6."
