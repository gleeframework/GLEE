"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take a small share and we can both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a very low offer, and even though it's round one, I'm hoping to get a better share later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, considering the money is losing value.  Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  This is the fairest way, given the declining value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Even though the money is worth less now, it's better to take the even split than risk getting nothing."
