"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the value of the money might decrease.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I understand Bob's reasoning. Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than my initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
