"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll get 40 dollars, which is still worth the same as in the first round. But Bob will get 60 dollars, which is worth 20% less than in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, since I'm giving up some potential value. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.
