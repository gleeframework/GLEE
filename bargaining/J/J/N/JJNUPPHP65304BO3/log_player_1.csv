I'm going to start with a proposal that's heavily in my favor. Since the money depreciates for Bob, I think he'll be willing to take a smaller share now than he would later.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, Bob is still taking a huge share of the money.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. Since the money is depreciating for Bob faster than for me, I think he'll be more motivated to take a fair deal now."
