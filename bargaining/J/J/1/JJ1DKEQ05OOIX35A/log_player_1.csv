"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's end this quickly!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original, so I'll get $7,200 (9000 * 0.8).

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
