"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, it's now worth $9,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round. My current gain of $9,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's $8,100. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $6,000, which is 60% of $10,000.

I'll accept this offer to get a better share of the money, even though it's not the best I could get.
