"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, but it's a good starting point and leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to split the money 50/50. I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the money, but it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
