"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very lopsided offer, and there's a lot of rounds left. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly. I'll take 55%, you get 45%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further inflation."
