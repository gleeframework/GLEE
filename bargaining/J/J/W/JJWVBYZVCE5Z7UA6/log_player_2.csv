"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you still get a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I will make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I will try to be a bit more aggressive in my proposal. Here is my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. We both get a decent share.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.
