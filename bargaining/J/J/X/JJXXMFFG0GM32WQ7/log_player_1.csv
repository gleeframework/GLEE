"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think carefully... I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
