Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better split, accepting this offer is the best option.  Each round is making Bob's share less valuable, and I'm not sure how much more he'll be willing to give.  It's better to take what I can get at this point."
