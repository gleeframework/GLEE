"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite unfavorable to me, even with the inflation adjustment. I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 85, hoping that will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  The inflation is starting to take effect, so I want to secure a good chunk of the money before it becomes too much of a disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm starting to run out of time.  While Bob's offer isn't great, it's better than getting nothing at all.  I'll accept and secure some money before it's too late."
