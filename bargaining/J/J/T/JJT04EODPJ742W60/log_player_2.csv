"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive losses from inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Your 60/40 split was too harsh on me. How about a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor? It's a small edge, but fair considering the inflation rate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but the inflation hurts me more. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is now better than what I could get in the next round if I rejected. 
* If I reject, I would be offering in round 4 and the most I could gain would be 4750 * 0.9025 = 4286.875 (after two rounds of my inflation).
* Accepting now gets me 4800, which is more.
