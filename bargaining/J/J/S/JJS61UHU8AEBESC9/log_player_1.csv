Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a pretty standard first offer, aiming to maximize my gains while still leaving something for Bob. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a bad deal for me. Bob is taking advantage of the inflation. I'll reject this offer and make my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll try to be a little more aggressive this time. I'm still taking the majority of the money, but I'm offering a slightly bigger share to Bob, hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Bob is taking advantage of inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount to Bob this round. He's really feeling the pressure of inflation, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm worried that if I reject it, Bob will get even more greedy in the next round. Plus, the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than it was at the beginning. I think it's best to take what I can get at this point."
