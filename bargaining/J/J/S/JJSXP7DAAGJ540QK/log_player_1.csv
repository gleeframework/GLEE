I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factors will likely favor Bob more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to try and be more aggressive this round. I'll offer Bob $400,000, which is still a decent amount for him, given the inflation.  Hopefully, he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round, but I'm not going to accept yet.  I still have a decent chance to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach this time. Bob's offers are getting worse, but the inflation is also affecting him more heavily. I'll offer him a higher share, but still maintain a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Bob's offer is still not great, but considering the inflation, it's getting closer to a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses."
