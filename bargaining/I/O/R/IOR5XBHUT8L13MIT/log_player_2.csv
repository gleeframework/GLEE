**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value is decreasing significantly with each round. By continuing to reject her offers, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk getting nothing to get a fairer share.  There's a chance she'll start panicking as we get closer to the final rounds and offer a more agreeable split."
