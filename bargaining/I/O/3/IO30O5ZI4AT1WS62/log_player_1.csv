I propose a 90/10 split, giving me 900,000 and Bob 100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, giving me 600,000 and Bob 400,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, acknowledging Bob's rejection and the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a better deal than my previous offer considering the inflation. It's a slight loss from the first round, but it's the best option in this scenario."
