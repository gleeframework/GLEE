I'm going for a big share, but I'm leaving Bob with something to make him think about accepting.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to play the same game, but I'm not going to let him.  I'll take my chances with inflation and propose a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time, acknowledging that we both need to compromise to get something. It's still a decent amount for me considering the inflation, and I hope Bob will see the value in a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedier, but I'm not giving in. I still believe there's a chance to get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm still holding out for a fairer deal, but I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. I'm going to offer a slightly higher share to Bob, hoping he'll see the value in a deal before it's too late."
