I'm going to offer a slightly more even split again. I think Alice is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  Maybe this will be enough to convince her to accept."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is getting closer to a more even split, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  The inflation is hitting Alice harder than me, and with only a few rounds left, I think I can get her to accept something closer to what I want."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to stick with offering a slightly more even split. With the inflation increasing, Alice has fewer and fewer rounds to try and get a better deal. I think she'll accept this offer before the game ends and both of us get nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.

This is a great offer! While the inflation has affected my gains, I'm happy to accept an even split. It's better than risking getting nothing at all."
