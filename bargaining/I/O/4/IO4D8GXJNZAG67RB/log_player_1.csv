"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start by offering a generous 90% to myself and 10% to Bob. I'm hoping that this will be enough to secure a deal in the first round and avoid any potential inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it seems like a good deal at first glance, the inflation means that I'm only getting 8% of the original value of $100. It's better to risk further rounds and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the remaining value.  Since we're both losing value with each round, I want to try and get a deal done before things get too bad. I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of this offer in comparison to the risk of further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still reject this offer.  Even though it seems like a generous offer from Bob, my share is now only worth 16% of the original value of $100.  The risk of further rounds still seems preferable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering 30% to Bob, hoping that he'll see the value in securing a deal before the inflation cuts into his potential gain even further.  I'm still holding out for a better deal, but I recognize that we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering me a significant amount, my share is now only worth 24% of the original value of $100. It's not a good deal for me, and there's still time for the inflation to shrink my potential share even further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining value. The inflation is getting really bad, and I need to secure a deal soon. I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of getting something rather than risking losing everything in the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take anything at this point, my share is now only worth 32% of the original value.  It's still better to try and get a slightly better deal in the next round, even though the inflation will only continue to worsen."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering an even split. With the inflation hitting both of us hard, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. It's a chance for us to avoid losing everything in the final rounds."
