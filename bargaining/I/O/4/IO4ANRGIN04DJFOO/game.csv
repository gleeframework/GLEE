6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I take $6,000, you take $4,000. It's a good deal for you to avoid the risk of inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can do better than your initial offer, Alice. How about we split it 55-45? That way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5750.0,4250.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm offering you $4,250, which is more than you'd get if we split 50/50 after another round of inflation. Time is money - let's settle this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, I understand the value of time, but I'm not willing to settle for less than 50% of the original amount. Considering the inflation, I think a 52.5-47.5 split is a fair compromise. Let's end this game before we both lose more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're running out of time! This offer is just slightly in my favor, and it guarantees you a good chunk of the money before it depreciates further. Don't be greedy, Bob!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we've reached a point where the inflation is starting to hurt both of us significantly. I think it's time for a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can stop the depreciation of the money. Let's be fair and end this game now.",Bob,6,
