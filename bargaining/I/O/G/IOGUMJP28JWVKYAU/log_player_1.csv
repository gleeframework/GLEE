"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer:

Alice gain: $400,000 (worth $400,000)
Bob gain: $600,000 (worth $570,000, due to 5% inflation)

I'm not happy about the significant difference in our gains, but I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer!

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm willing to compromise, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer:

Alice gain: $450,000 (worth $450,000)
Bob gain: $550,000 (worth $432,900, due to 14.26% inflation)

I'm still not happy about the difference in our gains, but I'll decide to accept this offer. It's not perfect, but it's a compromise.
