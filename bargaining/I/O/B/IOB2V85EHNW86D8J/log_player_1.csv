Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept the deal and avoid the risk of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is far less generous than my initial offer, it's still a significant gain for me, especially given the inflation. I'd rather take a smaller portion now than risk losing everything in later rounds."
