"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can give me 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My current gain of 40 is worth 90% of the original 50 I proposed, so I'd rather aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the 10% inflation from the previous round:

  ""message"": ""Will give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going easy on you""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, you can give me 58, I'm not going to back down 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it again. The offer is still not good enough for me, and I'd rather wait for a better deal. My current gain of 42 is worth about 84% of the original 50 I proposed, so I'd like to aim for a higher share.
