I'm going to be greedy and try to get a big chunk of the money. I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is already hitting hard.  I don't want to risk getting nothing at all, especially with Bob's offer being significantly higher for him.  I'll accept and take what I can get."
