"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is tempting, it's a lot better to try and negotiate for a larger share. 10% is too low, especially with the inflation factor in play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. This ensures we both get a good share, and we avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor.  Let's split it 70/30.  It's a fair deal given the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 70/30 is better than the previous offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Given the inflation, I can afford to hold out for more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about inflation, but 70/30 is still too one-sided. Let's meet in the middle at 65/35. This is a fair split that accounts for the inflation and ensures both of us get a substantial share.""}
