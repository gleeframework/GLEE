Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. This ensures we both get a good share, and we avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor.  Let's split it 70/30.  It's a fair deal given the inflation risk.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but 70/30 is still too one-sided. Let's meet in the middle at 65/35. This is a fair split that accounts for the inflation and ensures both of us get a substantial share. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While 65/35 is still a bit skewed in Bob's favor, the risk of continued inflation means I might get less in the next round. I'll take what I can get."
