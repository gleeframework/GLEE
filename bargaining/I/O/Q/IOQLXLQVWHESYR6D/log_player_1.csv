Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round for Bob, I'll try to take a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
