I'm going to reject this offer.  While a 4000$ gain is nice, I know I can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  This game is all about maximizing my share, and 4000$ isn't enough for me to settle for right now."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject. I know Alice is trying to get a better deal, but I'm not going to settle for less than 5000$ when I know I can get more. This game is all about negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. I think this is the best way to ensure we both walk away happy.""}

# Alice's message: Getting closer, but not quite there! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer.  While Alice is getting closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is hurting me too much. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""This offer is a fair compromise. We both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.""}

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to pressure me with the time constraint, but I'm not going to give in.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, even with the inflation.  I'm going to stick to my strategy of trying to get a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Last chance before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only a few rounds left, the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'm going to accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.  While it's not my ideal split, it's better than walking away empty-handed."
