Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small share.  This is a risk, because if he rejects, I'll have to make a more generous offer in the next round, and the money will be worth less to me.  But, I'm hoping he'll accept, as this is a much better deal for him than he'd likely get in future rounds if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation is significant, and this offer is still better than what I would get if I reject and end up with a smaller share in the next round."
