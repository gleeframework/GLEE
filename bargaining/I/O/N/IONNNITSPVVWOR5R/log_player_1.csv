"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping this is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth only 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $45.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, but I'll assume it's $40.

I'm happy with this offer, as it's a 50/50 split. I'll accept it.
