Alice's offer:

Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable split. This way, we both get a significant portion, and I'm willing to take a bit less to ensure we both benefit.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting late in the game. This is a strong offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the inflation is making it increasingly risky to keep rejecting."
