"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money is worth 20% less now, Bob's offer is actually equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 300000 / 0.8 = 375000
* Bob gain: 700000 / 0.8 = 875000

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. My goal is to get a good share while keeping some room for negotiation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! The money is worth even less now. Let's calculate the equivalent values:

* Alice gain: 450000 / 0.5208 ≈ 865769
* Bob gain: 550000 / 0.5208 ≈ 1053691

This offer is actually quite generous from Bob's perspective. I think I can do better than that, but I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy. For now, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now. My goal is to get a good share while keeping some room for negotiation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer. Let's calculate the equivalent values:

* Alice gain: 400000 / 0.3237 ≈ 123609
* Bob gain: 600000 / 0.3237 ≈ 185411

This offer is actually quite close to a 2:1 split, which is quite generous from Bob's perspective. I think I can do better than that, but I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy. For now, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now. My goal is to get a good share while keeping some room for negotiation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for an 80-20 split, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. I'm leaving Bob with a smaller share, but I'm also taking a risk that he might reject this offer and I'll get an even worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting extremely scarce. Let's calculate the equivalent values:

* Alice gain: 250000 / 0.2084 ≈ 120193
* Bob gain: 750000 / 0.2084 ≈ 360193

This offer is actually a very small share for me, but I don't have much room for negotiation at this point. I'll have to consider whether it's better to take this offer or risk waiting for a better one. For now, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is almost worthless at this point. My goal is to get as much as possible, even if it's a small amount. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I'm taking the majority of the remaining money, but I'm leaving Bob with a tiny share. I'm not sure if he'll accept this offer, but I'm running out of options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is almost worthless at this point. Let's calculate the equivalent values:

* Alice gain: 100000 / 0.1342 ≈ 74453
* Bob gain: 900000 / 0.1342 ≈ 670511

This offer is a very small share for me, but I don't have many options left. I'll have to consider whether it's better to take this offer or risk waiting for a better one. However, I'm not sure if Bob will make a better offer in the next round, and I'm running out of time. For now, I'll reject this offer.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is almost worthless at this point. My goal is to get as much as possible, even if it's a tiny amount. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,

```

This way, I'm taking almost the entire remaining amount, leaving Bob with a tiny share. I'm not sure if he'll accept this offer, but I'm running out of options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round, and I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. Let's calculate the equivalent values:

* Alice gain: 500000 / 0.0846 ≈ 5887
* Bob gain: 500000 / 0.0846 ≈ 5887

It's a 50-50 split, and the money is almost worthless at this point. I'm not sure if I should take this offer, but I don't have any other options left. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
