Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and then we can reassess and adjust as needed based on the outcome of the game."
