Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 7000 is a fair amount for the diminishing returns, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
