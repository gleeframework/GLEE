Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  This leaves room for negotiation if you'd like to increase your share in the next round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a split of 4500 for me and 5500 for you. This aims to be a fairer distribution considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
