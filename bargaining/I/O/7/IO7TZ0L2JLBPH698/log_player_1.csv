I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a good deal early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation.  I'd rather take the guaranteed 50% than risk losing more in future rounds."
