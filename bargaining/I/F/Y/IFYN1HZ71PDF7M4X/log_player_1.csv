"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 60% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 84% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer yet. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping it's more favorable to me this time."
