"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I believe this is a fair offer to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: I am rejecting this offer because I believe I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds. Since we have 12 rounds to divide the money, I want to negotiate for a more favorable split. Additionally, the threat of inflation, which reduces the value of the money by 5% each round, adds pressure on both of us to reach a mutually acceptable agreement sooner rather than later. By rejecting this initial offer, I am hoping to signal to Alice that I am willing to negotiate and potentially compromise, but I need a more equitable distribution of the funds."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split, considering the decreasing value of money over rounds.""}\n\nReasoning: In this round, I am making an offer that slightly favors me but still gives Alice a substantial amount. By doing so, I am trying to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us, taking into account the pressure of inflation. My message to Alice emphasizes the need for a balanced split, acknowledging the impact of the decreasing value of money over the rounds, which affects both of us equally. This approach aims to encourage Alice to consider the long-term implications of delaying an agreement and the potential benefits of settling on a division sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for balance, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: I am rejecting Alice's offer in round 3 because, although she has moved closer to a balanced split, I believe there is still room for negotiation. The effects of inflation are starting to show, with the money now worth 9.75% less than in the first round, which adds urgency to reaching an agreement. However, since we are only in round 3 out of 12, I feel there is time to try and negotiate a slightly better deal. By rejecting this offer, I am signaling to Alice that while her move towards the middle is appreciated, I require a bit more compromise to accept a division. This strategy is based on the hope that Alice will be motivated to avoid further losses due to inflation and thus may be willing to concede more in the next rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, let's aim for a more equitable division that reflects the urgency of the situation.""}\n\nReasoning: In this round, I am making an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than the previous one but still represents a compromise. Given the increasing pressure of inflation, which has now reduced the value of the money by 9.75% compared to the first round, I believe it's crucial to reach an agreement relatively soon. By offering Alice 4750, I am acknowledging her desire for a substantial share while also emphasizing the need for a more balanced split due to the decreasing value of the money. My message to Alice highlights the urgency of the situation, aiming to encourage her to consider the long-term implications of further negotiations and the potential benefits of accepting this offer. This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is also aware of the negative impact of inflation and may be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out Bob, this offer is good for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: I am accepting Alice's offer in round 5 because, considering the significant impact of inflation, which has now reduced the value of the money by 18.55% compared to the first round, I believe this offer represents a reasonable compromise. Alice's message emphasizes the urgency of the situation, and I agree that time is a critical factor at this point. By accepting this offer, I am securing a substantial amount of money, even if it's not perfectly balanced. The risk of continuing negotiations and potentially facing further devaluation of the money outweighs the potential benefits of trying to negotiate a slightly better deal. Additionally, Alice's offer shows a willingness to meet closer to the middle, indicating that she is also motivated to reach an agreement. Therefore, accepting this offer seems like the most prudent decision, given the circumstances."
