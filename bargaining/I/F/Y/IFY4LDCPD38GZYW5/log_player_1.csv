I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to get the game over quickly. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge drop from what I proposed. It's not worth it to accept such a low amount, especially with inflation. I'll counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's. I hope this makes him reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than last round, and the inflation is really biting now.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a fair split. The inflation is making things difficult, but I'm hoping Bob will realize it's better to accept a reasonable deal rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is hurting me badly, but I still need to hold out for a better deal. Bob's offers keep getting worse, and I'm not giving in to his greed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm making one final attempt at a reasonable compromise. This offer reflects the significant inflation impact, but I'm still giving Bob a fair share.  It's getting risky, but I believe this is the best option for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is getting out of hand, but I'm still not going to cave in. Bob's offer is becoming more and more unreasonable, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount.  I'm determined to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

With only 3 rounds left, the inflation is a serious threat.  I'm going to offer a compromise that gives Bob more, hoping he'll accept before we both risk getting nothing.  It's a gamble, but I believe it's our best chance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only two rounds left, and the inflation continuing to erode my share, I have to accept Bob's offer.  Even though it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
