"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this seems like a fair split initially, it's important to consider the inflation.  Since Bob loses 20% of the value with each round, accepting this offer early means losing a significant chunk of potential gains. It's better to see if Alice will budge a bit more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly.  It's the fairest way to start, and avoids any potential losses from inflation.""}
