Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob. Hopefully, this encourages him to accept, and we can avoid the risk of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. Even though it's a significant amount of money, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll aim to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share this round, but still a substantial amount. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his previous offer, but I'm ready to push for a higher percentage if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. The inflation is really starting to hurt my potential earnings, and while I would prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get at this point."
