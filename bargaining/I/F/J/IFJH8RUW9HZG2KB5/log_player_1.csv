"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making the proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000 / 0.9 = $5,555.56
* Bob gain: $5,000 / 0.9 = $5,555.56

I'll accept this offer.
