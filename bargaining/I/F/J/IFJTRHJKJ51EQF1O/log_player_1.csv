"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a bit more. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision in the format specified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut decreases significantly next round, let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to consider the adjusted value of the offer. However, considering Bob's message that my cut decreases significantly next round, I have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus potentially getting a worse deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nGiven the adjusted values and Bob's warning, I decide to accept this offer to secure a reasonable gain rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
