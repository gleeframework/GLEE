6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering the inflation we are facing. Let's close the deal now and avoid losing money.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. You'll lose 10% of the value if we go to the next round, so let's settle now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  My offer is now 51/49.  Another round and the money shrinks again.  This is fair considering the time pressure.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"The inflation is really hurting your share. I'm willing to take a bit more, but I'm still being generous. 58/42 is my final offer. Don't let the money lose more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now.  It's the only fair outcome given the circumstances.  Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
