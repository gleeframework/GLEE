"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm keeping the rest for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's offer is 4500, that's equivalent to 4,500 / 0.95 = 4737.89 in the original value, which is a bit less than my original offer.

However, I still think this is a reasonable offer, and I'd rather accept it than risk going to the next round.
