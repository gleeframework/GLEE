"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she takes $600,000 and Bob takes $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair division. It's now Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an even split to ensure a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine, I believe I can propose a more favorable division in the next round. The even split seems fair at face value, but the inflation factor gives me leverage to potentially gain more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my proposed gain to $700,000 and decreased Bob's to $300,000, arguing that considering the inflation affecting Bob's gain, this is still a generous offer. The strategy here is to press the advantage given by the inflation factor, making it more enticing for Bob to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his message framing it as a final offer and the threat of further losses from inflation, the numbers still favor me. Given that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round and Bob's share continues to devalue, I believe there's room to push for an even better deal in the next round. Bob's urgency might be a tactic to pressure me into accepting, but the economic advantage remains on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, this is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my proposed gain to $750,000 and decreased Bob's to $250,000, emphasizing that the significant devaluation of Bob's share due to inflation warrants this adjustment. The strategy is to continue leveraging the inflation factor to my advantage, presenting this offer as a reasonable and pragmatic decision given the circumstances. The aim is to make it clear to Bob that further resistance would only lead to him losing more value."
