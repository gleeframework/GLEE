This is a terrible deal! I'm going to try to get a better deal."

I'm offering Alice a small share, hoping she'll take it to avoid the risk of losing more in the next rounds."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is much better than my previous offer. While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer secures me some money and avoids the risk of losing everything in the next rounds."
