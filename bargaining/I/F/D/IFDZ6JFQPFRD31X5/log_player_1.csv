"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split in my favor is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
