"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $100,000. I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so I need to adjust my decision accordingly.

Since the money is worth 20% less, the value of my potential gain of $300,000 is actually 80% of $300,000, which is $240,000.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.
