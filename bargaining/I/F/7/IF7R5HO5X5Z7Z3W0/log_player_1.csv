"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my offer for the first round. I'm taking a large share, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept this early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. It's not fair to me and I am hoping to get more money. I am aware of the inflation, but I am willing to risk it and see what happens in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my initial demand, but still trying to secure a majority of the money. It's a gamble, but I believe that Bob might be more willing to compromise after rejecting my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with the offer, and I'm hoping to get more than $4000. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm now offering a more balanced split, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation is significant, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing in the end."
