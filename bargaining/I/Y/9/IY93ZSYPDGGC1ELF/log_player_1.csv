"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and give Bob 40% ($400,000), with the message ""Let's be fair"". This division is not equal, but considering the inflation that affects both players differently, Alice might be trying to compensate for the higher devaluation of her share in subsequent rounds if the game continues. It's now Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight hit to speed things up. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer. Despite the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for both players, Alice might believe that accepting 40% of the money (now worth less due to inflation) is not the best option, especially since her share is devaluing faster than Bob's. By rejecting, Alice chooses to proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal or to make an offer that Bob will accept before the value of the money decreases further for her."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice takes into account the inflation that has affected both players' potential gains. Given that her share devalues faster, Alice adjusts her proposal to take 55% of the money ($550,000), offering Bob 45% ($450,000), and includes a message suggesting that this division is a compromise considering the impact of inflation. This approach aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both, but particularly for Alice."
