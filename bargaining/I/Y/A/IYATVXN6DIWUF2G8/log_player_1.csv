Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. I've attached a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This is more than fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you""
}

I've taken into account the inflation and made a slightly more generous offer to Bob, while still trying to get a good deal for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
