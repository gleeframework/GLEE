Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Analyze the current situation and previous offers.
We are in Round 3 of the game. In Round 1, I (Alice) offered a 60-40 split in my favor, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob countered with the same split but in his favor, which I rejected.

### Step 2: Consider Bob's perspective and the need for compromise.
Given that we both offered the same split but in our own favors and both were rejected, it's clear we need to find a middle ground to avoid losing the money.

### Step 3: Determine the next offer, aiming for a compromise that might be acceptable to Bob.
Since the 60-40 split did not work in either direction, the next logical step is to propose a 50-50 split. This is a fair and equitable division that should appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, as it does not favor either party.

### Step 4: Craft the offer and message to Bob.
The offer will be a 50-50 split, with a message emphasizing the fairness and the need for compromise to ensure we both receive a share of the money.

### Step 5: Finalize the offer in the required JSON format.
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle for a fair share.""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle for a fair share.""}"
