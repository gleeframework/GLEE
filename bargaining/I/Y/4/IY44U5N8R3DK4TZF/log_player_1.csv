"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer. I'll keep 90% and give Bob 10%. I'm hoping he'll accept it since we both get something. But I'll be prepared to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's true that the money I'm getting is worth 10% less due to inflation, Bob's offer is still very unfair. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time. I'm willing to reduce my share to 80% and give Bob 20%. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation that's already happened."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, it's still not a fair split considering the impact of inflation on my earnings.  I'm going to reject it and hope for a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a fair deal. This time I'm reducing my share to 70% and offering Bob 30%.  I'm hoping he'll realize that we need to reach a compromise before the value of the money drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While the value of the money is rapidly diminishing for me, I can't accept a deal where I get only 30% while Bob keeps 70%.  I'm determined to keep negotiating for a fairer share, even though time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

With the money rapidly losing value, I'm willing to make a significant concession this time. I'm reducing my share to 60% and offering Bob 40%. This is a substantial shift towards a more equal split, and I hope he'll recognize the urgency of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still not fair considering the inflation impact on my share. I'm losing a significant portion of my potential gains with each round.  I'm going to reject this offer and try for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With the money continuing to lose value, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair and equal division, and I hope Bob will finally recognize the need to come to an agreement.  We're nearing the end of our time, and the consequences of failing to reach a decision are becoming more significant with each passing round."
