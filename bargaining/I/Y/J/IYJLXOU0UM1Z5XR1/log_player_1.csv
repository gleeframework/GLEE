"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider that the money I gain is still worth 80% of the initial amount, but Bob's gain is worth only 90% of the initial amount (due to the 10% decrease in value).

Considering this, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
# Alice gain: 5000 (initial value)
# Bob gain: 4500 (initial value, due to 10% decrease)
```

Since my gain is worth more than Bob's gain in this round, I'll accept his offer.
