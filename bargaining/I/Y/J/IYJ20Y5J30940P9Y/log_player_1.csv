Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think I can do better. How about we split the difference from your offer? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's analyze why this is a good strategy:

* **Time Pressure:** Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor. While he gets a seemingly small increase from his perspective, the impact of inflation on my potential earnings is significant.  I need to push for a better deal quickly.
* **Future Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a fairer share.  This puts me in a stronger position to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer gives you a decent share considering the time pressure and inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Position:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I've demonstrated I'm not desperate and won't accept an unfair deal. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  I'm offering slightly less than my previous offer to account for inflation, but still aiming for a larger share than Bob proposed. 
* **Direct Communication:** The message is firm but not aggressive, aiming for a  mutually beneficial agreement."
