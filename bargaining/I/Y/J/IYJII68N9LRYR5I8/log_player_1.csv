"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but still a decent chunk of the total, while keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to get a larger share, considering the money I gained in the first round is still worth the same, and I'd be giving up half of that amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 30% to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to secure at least 40% to make it worthwhile for me. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is to give me 600,000, which is worth 72.9% of the original 600,000, I'll decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer because it's a decent compromise, and I'd rather get 72.9% of 600,000 than continue negotiating further."
