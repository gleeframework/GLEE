"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob, considering the risk and uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's risky to accept in the first round. There's a chance that Alice will offer a better deal in the future, and the inflation will only hurt Bob's potential gains further. It's better to see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
