"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob will get $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you get a small share. Accept? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, the actual value of my share is $30 * 0.8 = $24.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $24, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
