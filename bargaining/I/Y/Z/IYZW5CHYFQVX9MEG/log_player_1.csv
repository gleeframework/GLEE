"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 8000 and Bob gets 2000. This is a 4:1 ratio, which seems fair to me since we're starting from scratch."

# Alice gain: 4000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 6000 for him and 4000 for me, I'll try to adjust the numbers to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing that I get 5500 and Bob gets 4500. This is a 1.22:1 ratio, which is slightly more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're getting the best deal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
