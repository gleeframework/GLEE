Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very uneven split. I figure Bob will probably accept it in the first round, since he's only losing 5% per round.  It's worth a shot!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with the inflation, this offer is still much better than what I'd get if we keep going. It's risky, but I'll take it!"
