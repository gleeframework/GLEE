"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a 90/10 split. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 90/10 split is tempting, it's better to see if Alice will budge a bit more. There are still many rounds left and inflation will make the money worth less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can reach a more equitable split. Let's try 60/40.  It's still a fair deal, and it shows we're both willing to compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  Let's try a 65/35 split. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it shows we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500
