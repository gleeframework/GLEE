Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, especially now. This is a fair offer considering the decreasing value. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer means Bob will get even less.
* **Alice's Offer Improvement:**  Alice has shifted the offer slightly in Bob's favor compared to her Round 1 offer.
* **Risk of Further Rejection:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee he can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Alice might become more aggressive, and the shrinking pot due to inflation makes it less likely for Bob to come out ahead. 

**In essence, taking the sure, albeit slightly smaller, amount now is preferable to the risk of getting even less later.**
