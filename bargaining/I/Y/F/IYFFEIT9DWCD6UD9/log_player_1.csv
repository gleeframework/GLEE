"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm trying to maximize my gain, but I'm also leaving a decent amount for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gain!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 500,000 is equivalent to 400,000 in the first round. That's a significant reduction.

I'll have to weigh the benefits of taking a smaller share now against the risk of potentially getting a worse deal in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, my potential gain is now worth even less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to maximize my gain.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You can't do better than this, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but don't get too excited! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain of 400,000 is equivalent to only 207,200 in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

Considering the offer, I'm getting a smaller share of the money, but at least it's a better deal than my previous offer. I'll have to weigh the benefits of taking a smaller share now against the risk of potentially getting a worse deal in future rounds.

However, I'm not sure if I should trust Bob's message. He says it's a ""better deal"", but I'm not sure if he's just trying to lull me into a false sense of security.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll try to get as much as possible while still leaving Bob with a decent share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or walk away!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain of 300,000 is equivalent to only 123,200 in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

Considering the offer, I'm getting a very small share of the money, and Bob is getting the majority. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, but I also don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds.

However, Bob's message suggests that he's not giving up yet, and he might make a better offer in the next round. I'll have to weigh the benefits of taking a small share now against the risk of potentially getting a better deal later.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be extremely aggressive in my offer. I'll try to get as much as possible while still leaving Bob with a tiny share.

However, considering the number of rounds left, I'll have to be more realistic and accept that I might not get the best deal. I'll aim for a slightly better share than my previous offers.

Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential gain. My gain of 100,000 is equivalent to only 20,800 in the first round, which is a tiny fraction of what I could have gotten earlier.
