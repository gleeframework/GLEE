Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now I'm taking more! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is killing me.  Taking $3800 now is better than risking even less in the next round. 
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:**  She's shown a willingness to play hardball, and my negotiating position is only getting worse. 

It's not ideal, but it's the most logical choice given the circumstances."
