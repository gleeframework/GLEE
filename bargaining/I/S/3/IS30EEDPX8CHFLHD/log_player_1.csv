"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both have an equal chance of being the proposer in the next round, so why not be fair? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. It's a fair proposal, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing more value due to inflation.
