"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially with inflation in play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous this round, but I'm sure you'll be more agreeable next time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's only fair! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Let's call it a day. A 50/50 split is fair, and with the uncertainty of inflation, it's a good deal."
