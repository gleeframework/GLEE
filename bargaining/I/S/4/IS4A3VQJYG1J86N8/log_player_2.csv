"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly! Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. It's round one, and I have nothing to lose by holding out.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I'm going to take the lion's share this time.  It's the price of waiting.  Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of. Let's find a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing."
