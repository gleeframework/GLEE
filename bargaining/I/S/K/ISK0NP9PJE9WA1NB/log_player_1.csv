"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me 70% of the current value of the money, as I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but still being cautious and not giving up too much."
