"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good deal for myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my initial offer would be worth 90% of its original value, so I'm now considering a proposal that's worth 90% of $6000, which is $5400.

Since Bob's offer is $5000 for me, which is less than $5400, I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, my offer is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll aim for a higher share to account for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my initial offer in this round. The money is worth 90% of its original value in round 1, and then another 27.1% less, so the value of my initial offer is 0.9 * 0.271 = 0.2439 (or 24.39%) of its original value.

Since Bob's offer is $4000, which is more than 24.39% of $6000 (=$1464), I'll accept it.
