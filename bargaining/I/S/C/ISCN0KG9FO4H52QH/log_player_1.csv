"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more money!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60 for him and 40 for me, and considering the inflation, I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the reduced value of the money for Bob.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than he initially proposed, but still a decent amount considering the reduced value of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really trying to take advantage of the inflation!

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money for Bob, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him a 70% share. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.
