"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting for a potential better offer. I'll accept Bob's offer.
