"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to settle for just $5,000, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share of the money and being reasonable, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try to get closer to a 60/40 split. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway on the 60/40 split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being reasonable and getting a decent share of the money, while also acknowledging the impact of inflation."
