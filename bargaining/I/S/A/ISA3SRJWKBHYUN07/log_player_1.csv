"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This offer gives me a significant amount of money upfront, but still leaves Bob with a substantial share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.
