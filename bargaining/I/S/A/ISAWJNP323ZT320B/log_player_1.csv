Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in later rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 in this round is worth 90% of $8,000, which is $7,200.
