"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understand the offer
Alice is offering a split where I, Bob, get $45 and she gets $55.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
Since there's no inflation for me but a 10% decrease in value for Alice with each passing round, waiting could potentially give me more bargaining power in future rounds.

## Step 3: Evaluate the fairness and potential future offers
The offer seems somewhat fair but slightly biased towards Alice. Considering the inflation impact on Alice, she might be willing to offer a better deal in the next round to avoid further devaluation of her potential gain.

## Step 4: Decide based on current offer and potential future gains
Given that I lose nothing by waiting and Alice's share devalues over time, it might be beneficial to reject this offer and see what she proposes in the next round.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","## Step 1: Determine my offer
Given that Alice's share devalues by 10% each round and we're now in round 2, her perception of the money's value has decreased. I will offer a split that slightly favors me more than the previous offer, considering the devaluation.

## Step 2: Calculate the offer
Alice's initial offer was $55 for her and $45 for me. Considering the devaluation, I'll adjust the offer to $50 for me and $50 for Alice, which seems fair given the circumstances.

## Step 3: Formulate the message
My message will emphasize the fairness of the offer and the consideration of the devaluation of money for her.

## Step 4: Finalize the offer
I will send the offer with a clear message explaining my reasoning.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Considering the devaluation, let's split equally to be fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the devaluation, I'll take a bit more, but still being fair 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understand the new offer
Alice is now offering a split where I, Bob, get $48 and she gets $52.

## Step 2: Consider the increased devaluation for Alice
The money for Alice is now worth 19% less than in the first round, which means she's more motivated to close the deal.

## Step 3: Evaluate the fairness and potential future offers
Given the increased devaluation, Alice's offer is somewhat fair but still slightly biased towards her. However, considering the trend, she might be willing to offer a better deal in the next round.

## Step 4: Decide based on current offer and potential future gains
Given the situation, it's likely that Alice will offer a more favorable deal in the next round due to the increasing devaluation of her share. I can afford to wait.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","## Step 1: Re-evaluate the situation
Considering Alice's increasing devaluation, now at 19% less than the original value, she's likely more eager to reach an agreement.

## Step 2: Adjust the offer
Given the circumstances, I'll adjust my offer to slightly favor myself more than the previous round, while still being somewhat fair.

## Step 3: Calculate the new offer
I'll propose $52 for myself and $48 for Alice, considering the increased devaluation of her share.

## Step 4: Formulate the message
My message will acknowledge the devaluation and express the need to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

## Step 5: Finalize the offer
I will send the offer with a clear message explaining my reasoning.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Given the increasing devaluation, this offer balances our interests.""}"
