**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings decreases.  While her offer isn't terrible, we can likely squeeze out a better deal in the next round or two.  I'm betting she'll be more willing to compromise significantly soon."
