"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."

# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not going for 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much more""}

I'm offering a 55.5/44.5 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I want more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it.

However, I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split. I was hoping to get a better deal than that. But I don't want to risk going to the next round and getting an even worse deal.
