Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the initial offer.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given that I am taking the risk of being rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to have more, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and the remaining money is worth less now due to inflation. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
