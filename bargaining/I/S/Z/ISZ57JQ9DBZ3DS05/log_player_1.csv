"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous too, Alice. How about a 95/5 split?  It's a fair offer considering the next round will be worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
