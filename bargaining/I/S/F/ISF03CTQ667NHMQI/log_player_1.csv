"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to get the negotiations going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I'm sure we can both agree this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll calculate the actual value of the money we'll gain, considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation.

My gain would be $5,000, but due to the 5% decrease in value, it's actually worth $4,750 to me.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since the money is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to make up for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, but I'm taking $7,000 for myself to try to make up for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is making things tough, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. This is my final offer before I accept whatever you propose next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the money we'll gain.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. My gain would be $4,000, but due to the decrease in value, it's actually worth $3,429.40 to me.

Bob's gain would be $6,000, but due to the 48.8% decrease in value, it's actually worth $3,124.80 to him.

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. However, I'll decide to reject it for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate. This is my last chance to get a decent share before the money is almost worthless.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob only $1,000, but I'm taking $9,000 for myself to try to make up for the decreasing value of the money."
