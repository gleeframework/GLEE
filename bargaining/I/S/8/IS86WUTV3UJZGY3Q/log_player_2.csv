Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. 70-30 seems fair now. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll accept a 70-30 split this time, but I'm not sure I can afford to keep going much longer with the inflation. Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given your last offer was essentially a return to my first proposal and considering the significant impact of inflation on your potential gain, I'm willing to take a firmer stance. 80-20 seems appropriate at this stage. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

At this point, the inflation has severely reduced my potential gains. Accepting the 80-20 split is the best way to salvage something."
