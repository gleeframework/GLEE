Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option in the long run, especially since our money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Bob's money is losing value faster than mine.  I need to aim for a better split in the earlier rounds to take advantage of this. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round when it's my turn to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll come down a little from my previous offer. This accounts for the time pressure and the fact that your money is losing value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 50/50 is still the best way to go.  The longer we wait, the less we'll both get. Let's avoid that! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to 50/50, likely hoping I'll panic as the rounds go on. However, it's still beneficial for me to wait a bit longer. Accepting a worse deal now would be a bigger loss than the gradual inflation. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share, but I also don't want to seem unreasonable and risk running out of time."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
