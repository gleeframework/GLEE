Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I need at least 60% to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it. The inflation is making this a risky game, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
