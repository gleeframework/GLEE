"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I don't think a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is fair, especially since I'm the one making the next offer. I'll wait for the next round to try to negotiate a better deal.

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, with a message suggesting a 55-45 split."
