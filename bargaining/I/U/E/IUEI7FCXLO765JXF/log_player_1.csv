"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can both go home!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. Let's talk! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to negotiate a more even split. However, I'm not willing to give up that much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the next round."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a more even split, but still trying to get a slightly larger share for myself."

Round 4

# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split is much fairer than your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to reason with me, but I'm not convinced that this split is fair. I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not settling for 40% yet!""
}
