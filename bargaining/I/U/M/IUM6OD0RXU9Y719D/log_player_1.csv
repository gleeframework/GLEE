"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is a compromise, I'll consider it. However, I'm not thrilled about giving away 400,000 more than I initially proposed. I'll have to think about whether I can do better.

For now, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Meeting you in the middle, but I'll take a slightly larger share""}

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a bit more than Bob's initial offer, while still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the direction this is heading, but I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

While Bob's offer is still a compromise, I'm not happy about giving away 600,000. I was hoping to get closer to 500,000. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing more.

For now, I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
