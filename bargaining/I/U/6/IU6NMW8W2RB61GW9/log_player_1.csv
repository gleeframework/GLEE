"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a relatively even split. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give you everything 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a bit.

I'm not thrilled with the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round!"
