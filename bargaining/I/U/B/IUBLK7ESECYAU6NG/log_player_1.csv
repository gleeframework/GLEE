"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total money, and I'll take $6000, which is 60% of the total money. I also sent a message to Bob saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. He can either accept my offer and finish the game or proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. If he proceeds to the next round, I'll have to decide whether to accept his offer or make another proposal. The catch is that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, while it's worth the same for Bob.\n\nLet's see what Bob decides to do!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! This offer is more than fair for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he claims it's more than fair considering the inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. With inflation, the $4500 he offered me is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a better share of the money.\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise""}\n\n###\n\nI've made a new offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation that's affecting my share of the money. I've proposed that I receive $5800 and Bob receive $4200, which is a slightly more even split than my initial offer. I've also included a message saying ""I'm willing to compromise"" to try to persuade Bob that I'm being reasonable and willing to work together to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn again. He can either accept my offer and finish the game, or reject it and make another counteroffer. Let's see what he decides to do!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to accept Bob's offer. Although I was initially hoping to get a better deal, the inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of the money for me. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I think it's time to cut my losses and accept Bob's offer. Additionally, Bob claims that this is his final offer, so I don't think I'll be able to negotiate a better deal. I'll take the $4900 and end the game here."
