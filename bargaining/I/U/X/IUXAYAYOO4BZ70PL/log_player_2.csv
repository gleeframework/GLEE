# Alice gain: 5050

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is inching closer to a more even split, the offer is still unacceptable. The longer this goes on, the more the value decreases for Bob, and Alice knows this.  It's likely she's trying to pressure Bob into accepting a less favorable deal. Holding firm on a 50/50 split is the best strategy for now, even though time is running out."
