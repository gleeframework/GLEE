"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, and you get 30%. I'm starting with a fair split, hoping we can build on this foundation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time.  I'm willing to take a bit less, but I think we can both do better than the last round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $32 (since it's 20% less than the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round).

I'm not too thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
