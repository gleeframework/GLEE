"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, I can compare the values directly.

My gain of 300,000 in this round is equivalent to 600,000 in the first round, which is less than my initial offer. Bob's gain of 700,000 in this round is equivalent to 700,000 in the first round, which is more than his initial offer.

I'll accept this offer.
