"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain in the first round to be $60 * 0.95 = $57. Since I was offered $55 in the second round, it's a slight decrease. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit lower than mine in the previous round. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}
```

This offer is a slight increase from my initial proposal, but still gives Bob a decent share. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is even more aggressive this time!

Let's calculate my gain in the first round with the inflation effect: $60 * 0.85126 = $51.076. Since I was offered $52 in the fourth round, it's actually a slight increase from my expected gain. I'll decide to accept this offer.
