"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount is $1,000,000. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or propose a new offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth less with each round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less with each round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55-45 is fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no need for haggling!""
}
```"
