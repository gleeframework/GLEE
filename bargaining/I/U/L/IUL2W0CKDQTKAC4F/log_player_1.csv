"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 55 for me, 45 for you""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. This is a slightly unequal division, but it's close enough to being fair that Bob might consider accepting it, especially since the value of the money will decrease in subsequent rounds. My message to Bob is a simple statement of the offer, with a hint that it's a reasonable and fair division.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he rejects it, he'll make a counteroffer in the next round, and we'll continue negotiating until one of us accepts the other's offer.\n\nLet's see what Bob decides to do!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this round, Bob has offered a division of $49 for me and $51 for himself. Considering the effects of inflation, my $49 is now worth 5% less than it would have been in the first round, and Bob's $51 is worth 10% less. This means that, in terms of the original value of the money, I'm being offered slightly less than I was in the first round, while Bob is offering himself slightly more.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the fact that the value of the money will continue to decrease in subsequent rounds. If I reject this offer, I'll have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth even less. Given the relatively small difference between Bob's offer and my original proposal, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round.\n\nSo, my decision is to accept Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI hope this is the end of the game! Let me know what happens next."
