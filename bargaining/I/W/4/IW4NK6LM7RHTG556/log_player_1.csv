Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more equitable.  Let's be reasonable - inflation is working against me. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money! This is my final offer before your share dwindles even further.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my last offer.  It's clear you won't accept anything less than a majority, but consider the impact of inflation.  This is the best I can do. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is now barely better than a 50/50 split considering the inflation working against him. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance his next offer will be even less favorable to me due to the shrinking pot from his perspective. It's time to take the sure thing and end the game."
