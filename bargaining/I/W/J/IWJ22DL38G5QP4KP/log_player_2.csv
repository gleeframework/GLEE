**Reasoning:**  Even though Alice is slowly increasing the offer, time is running out.  We're past the halfway point of the rounds, and I want to put more pressure on Alice to make a significant move towards a more even split."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  The clock is ticking, and we need to apply real pressure. By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling a strong stance and increasing the risk for Alice if she rejects it.  She'll be left with even less if we don't settle now."
