"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, it seems like he's trying to take advantage of me. I'd rather not give him 70% of the remaining value. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but not too greedy."
