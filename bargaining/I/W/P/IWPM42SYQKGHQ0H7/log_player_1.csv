"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's only fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but it's still too early to accept.  The inflation is working in my favor, and Bob is feeling the pressure to make a deal. I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""This is a generous offer considering the inflation. Don't miss out!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my demand to take advantage of the inflation pressure on Bob. He's already feeling the loss from the initial round, and this round will hurt him even more if he rejects.  My message aims to make him feel like he's getting a good deal before the value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but still fair considering the original amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still unacceptable.  While he frames it as a loss compared to the original amount, it's important to remember that the value of that original amount is steadily decreasing for him. I need to hold firm and aim for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  The clock is ticking, Bob!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply more pressure and potentially offer a concession to close the deal.  Bob is likely feeling the weight of the inflation by now, and this offer is still heavily in my favor. By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and may lead him to accept before the value diminishes further."
