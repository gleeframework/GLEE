Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a slight advantage to account for the inflation difference, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

``` 

This offer is better than what I proposed last round and the time pressure is becoming a significant factor. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, even with the inflation."
