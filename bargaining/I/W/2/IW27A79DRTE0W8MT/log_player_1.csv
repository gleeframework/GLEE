``` 
Let's start with a fair 50/50 split.  I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or try to get more!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept a deal where Bob gets more than me, especially since my share is worth less due to inflation. Let's see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

Since Bob rejected my fair offer and then tried to take more for himself, I'm going to try to get a slightly larger share. I'm still trying to be reasonable, but I want to show him that I'm not afraid to fight for what I deserve."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy!  I'm not going to accept a deal where he gets 70% and I get 30%, especially with inflation hurting my share.  Time to make another counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still leaving a good amount for Bob.  He needs to understand that his greed is going to backfire, and we both might end up with nothing if he continues to be unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable. I refuse to accept such a low share, especially with the increasing impact of inflation. I'll continue to fight for a more fair division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm pushing even harder now. Bob's greed is getting out of hand, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm offering him a decent share, but it's time for him to realize that we both need to be reasonable to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  This offer is insulting and a sign that he is only interested in maximizing his own gains, regardless of fairness or collaboration.  I will not accept this offer and will continue to negotiate for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm taking a big gamble here, but I'm starting to get desperate. Bob is being incredibly greedy, and I'm running out of time.  This is my final attempt at getting a fair share. I'm offering him a decent amount, but I need to get something for myself.  If he rejects this, I'm afraid we'll both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is outrageous! I am not going to accept such a small share, especially with inflation drastically reducing the value of my portion.  I've tried to be reasonable, but Bob is clearly only interested in maximizing his own gains. It appears this game is heading towards a disastrous outcome for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

This is my last chance. I'm taking a huge risk, but I have to try. I'm pushing for a bigger share, hoping that Bob will realize that we both need to compromise if we want to get anything at all. I'm offering him a decent amount, but I'm not willing to accept anything less than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is absolutely ridiculous! Bob is being completely unreasonable.  I refuse to accept such a small share, even with the looming threat of losing everything.  I've tried to be fair and compromise, but Bob's greed has gotten the best of him.  It's clear that we're both going to end up with nothing."
