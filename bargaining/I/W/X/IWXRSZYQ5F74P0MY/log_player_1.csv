"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept since the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation hits my gains more than Bob's, and if we reject, I risk getting a worse deal in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
