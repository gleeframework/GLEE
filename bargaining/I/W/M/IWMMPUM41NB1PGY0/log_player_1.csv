Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split given the inflation risk.  Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round, the value of the money decreases, especially for me. I need to push for a better deal quickly.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob's offer in Round 2 was heavily in his favor.  My rejection signals that I'm serious about getting a larger share.
* **Calculated Risk:** This offer is still a compromise, but it leans more towards my favor. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that a deal now is better than the risk of further depreciation."
