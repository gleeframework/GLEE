"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself. It's a fair starting point.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a decent chunk of the money, but also keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to split it 50/50, as it would mean I'd be giving up a significant amount of money. However, it's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
