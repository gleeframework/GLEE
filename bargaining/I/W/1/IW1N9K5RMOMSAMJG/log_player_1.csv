Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'm giving Bob 10% of the money, keeping 90% for myself.  Let's see if he's happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 500,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still less than what I offered Bob in the first round (after accounting for inflation). I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm going to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, hoping to entice him to accept. Due to inflation, I'm only receiving 800,000 for myself, but I'm still getting a good amount of the money. Let's see if this convinces Bob."
