Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money in the first round.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept such a lopsided offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more than 5% of the money, and he only gets 5% less because of inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
