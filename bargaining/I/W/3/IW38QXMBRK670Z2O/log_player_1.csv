"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leave $2,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 split seems like the most logical way to start.   
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my thinking.

Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $5,000 in this round is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 5% less, but I'll assume it's $4,750.

Considering the inflation effect, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 55% and take 45%, that way I get a slightly better deal considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 55% and take 45% of the current $10,000."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my thinking again.

Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $4,000 in the previous round is equivalent to $3,200 in this round.

I'll offer a new proposal to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% and take 60%, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation""

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $3,200 in the previous round is equivalent to $1,664 in this round.

* Bob's gain of $6,000 in this round is equivalent to $11,904 in the first round.
* Bob's gain of $4,000 in this round is equivalent to $7,692 in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $4,000 is really worth 14.26% less, but I'll assume it's $3,431.

I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my previous proposal, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think about it...

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really crippling the value of the money now!
