Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, this is a serious offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While time is ticking, accepting an offer where I consistently get less than 50% is a losing strategy. I need to show firmness to make her budge from her position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is it - a final offer for a fair deal. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on now.  Offering a 50/50 split sends a strong signal that I'm serious about fairness and unwilling to accept a bad deal due to the time constraint. It's a gamble, but the alternative is likely getting stuck in a loop of progressively worse offers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't final, was it? 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly toying with me and banking on me cracking under the pressure of inflation.  However, accepting this offer would mean getting less than half of the initial value, a terrible outcome.  I need to hold my ground and make it clear that her stalling tactics won't work."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I need to accept an offer that makes sense for me too.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show some flexibility, but not too much.  Alice is unlikely to accept a 50/50 split at this point, but I'm also not budging much lower. This offer still gives Alice a slight advantage but ensures I don't get completely lowballed in the remaining rounds. It sends a message that I'm willing to negotiate but within reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of options, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough pill to swallow, but with only three rounds left, the effects of inflation are too severe to ignore. Accepting this offer is a better outcome than risking getting zero or accepting an even worse offer in the final rounds. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and while I'm not happy with the outcome, it's the most logical choice in this situation."
