Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a slightly more even split is fairer, as the inflation rate may be unknown to us both. This offer keeps the possibility of negotiation open for subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
