"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can see how the game progresses from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a small share, but I'm taking the majority 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my money is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a fair cut""
}
```"
