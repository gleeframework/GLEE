Let's see how Bob reacts to this offer.  I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself, but leaving Bob with a decent amount to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take 100,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Even with the inflation, 100,000 is a decent amount."
