"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I think a 90/10 split is fair. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current split doesn't seem fair to me, and the inflation rate affects me more significantly. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a more even split, taking into account the inflation rate that affects me more.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 45/55 split is more reasonable. It's a starting point for negotiation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering the inflation we've both experienced. Let's work towards a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is an improvement, I still feel that the split doesn't adequately account for the significantly higher inflation rate I'm experiencing. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a more balanced division, considering we both have fewer rounds left before the money becomes worthless. Let's see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to find a compromise, considering the increasing inflation and the need for a mutually acceptable deal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Given the rising inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. A 48/52 split should account for both our losses. Let's settle before our shares devalue further.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
