Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. Accepting a 42/58 split is far from ideal, but it's better than waiting another round and getting even less."
