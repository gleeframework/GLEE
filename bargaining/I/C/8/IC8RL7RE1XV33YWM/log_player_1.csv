"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider that in my decision.

I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I'll consider Bob's offer. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation (5% in the first round and another 5% in the second round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher share to myself, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable with each round! Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in real terms:

 Initial amount: $100
 Inflation after 3 rounds: 1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 ≈ 0.8626 (or 86.26% of the original value)
 Actual amount I'd gain: 42 * 0.8626 ≈ $36.21

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
