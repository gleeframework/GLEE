Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve more than half 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stalling, likely hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress. While she's losing value due to inflation, my $46 offer still stands as a fair deal given the circumstances. I need to remain firm to maximize my potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 47,

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think I can get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this is the same offer I made in Round 2.  Given the inflation working against Alice, she's unlikely to offer more. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
