"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For Round 1, I would have received $70, which is now worth 90% of its original value, so I would have received $63. However, in Round 2, the money is worth 90% of its original value from Round 1, so I would receive $63 * 0.9 = $56.70.

Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I would receive $50.

I'll accept Bob's offer to meet halfway. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
