"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 99/1 split in my favor.  While this might seem unfair, I believe it's a good starting point.  Bob can either accept it and we both get something, or he can reject it and risk losing more in subsequent rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it is better than the previous round, it is still a very unfavorable split. I am confident that I can get a more equitable deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable division, and I believe it is in both of our best interests to reach an agreement before inflation further erodes the value of the money."
