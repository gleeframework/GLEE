"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a ridiculously unfair offer, even with the risk of inflation. It's worth taking a chance to see if Alice might be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This is a more balanced offer, giving Alice a smaller share but still ensuring a significant gain. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to her than her previous proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than the first round, it's still significantly skewed in Alice's favor.  I'm hoping that by continuing to reject, I can push for a fairer split. The inflation is a factor, but I still have a good chance of getting a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable solution, and hopefully, it will convince Alice to accept. The risk of inflation is still there, but I believe a fair deal is more important than maximizing my potential gains in this round."
