"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the million!""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 300,000 * 0.9 (10% less than 600,000) = 270,000
* Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.95 (5% less than 740,000) = 665,000

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I would gain:

* My gain: 450,000 * 0.7269 (27.1% less than 600,000) = 327,141
* Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.85574 (14.26% less than 640,000) = 471,509

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob. I'll reject his offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair and equal split, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
