"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to propose a pretty uneven split. I want to get most of the money since I'm making the first offer. Hopefully, Bob is reasonable and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I would prefer more money, the inflation makes it a better deal than rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the next round.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal, and I risk losing even more money due to inflation."
