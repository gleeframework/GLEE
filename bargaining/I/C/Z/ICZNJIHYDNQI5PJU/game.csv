6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money evenly. I suggest we each take $6000 and $4000 respectively.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your fairness, but I think I can get a better deal.  Let's try a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share.  This way, we both get a fair amount while still leaving room for negotiation in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose we divide the money as follows: I'll take $5250 and you'll receive $4750. This keeps our shares roughly equal to what they would have been without inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"While I appreciate you acknowledging inflation, I think we can find a split that's more fair for both of us. I'm willing to offer you $4500, but I need to secure at least $5500 for myself to make it worthwhile. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
