I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the deal done early. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy. I'll take my chances with a higher offer in the next round.  The inflation is affecting him less than me, but I still have time to turn things around."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for inflation, but still giving Bob a decent share. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't give in to his unreasonable demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation!  I'm not going to give in to his demands. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is hitting me hard now, but I'm still holding out for a fair share. This offer is a compromise, but I'm not giving in to Bob's greed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed is getting out of hand. I'm still losing more to inflation than he is, but I won't settle for a deal that's so unfair. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm making a significant concession to Bob, offering him 6000, hoping he'll finally see reason.  We're both losing value to inflation, and I'm running out of time.  Hopefully, he'll realize it's better to take a decent deal than to risk getting nothing at all."
