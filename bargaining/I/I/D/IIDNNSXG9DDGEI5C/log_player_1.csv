"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount of $1,000,000. I'm giving Bob a significant chunk of money, but I'm also keeping the majority for myself. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you can have it now and avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. This way, we can both get something and avoid further negotiation.""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a smaller share, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 48.8% less than the original amount. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

However, since Bob's offer is still a compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and facing further inflation, I'll accept this offer.
