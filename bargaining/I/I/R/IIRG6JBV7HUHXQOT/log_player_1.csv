"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 70% of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```

I'm offering 75% of the remaining value, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 72 
# Bob gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the continued decrease in the value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as the difference between 72% and 75% is relatively small, and I'm not confident I can do better in the next round."
