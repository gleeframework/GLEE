"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a classic game theory scenario!  While $10 is better than nothing, I'm going to reject. I have 12 rounds, so I can try to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to offer Alice $10 and keep $90 for myself.  This is a risky strategy, as Alice could reject and then get a better offer in the next round. However, it maximizes my potential gains and puts the pressure on her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is starting to see the pressure. While $20 is more than the initial offer, it's still not great. I'm going to keep rejecting and try to get a better deal. The inflation is hurting Alice more than me, and she might be willing to compromise more in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a very unequal split and hoping Alice will cave. The inflation is hurting her more, so she might be more inclined to accept a smaller share to avoid getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get a better deal, but I'm not going to budge. I know the inflation is hurting her much more than me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to keep increasing my share while offering Alice a very small portion. The inflation is starting to get to her, and she might be desperate for any money at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to keep pushing my luck. The inflation is really starting to hurt Alice now, and I think I can still get a better deal. I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to keep increasing my share, but I'm starting to worry about the time pressure. Alice is probably getting desperate, but there's a chance she'll keep rejecting until the last round and we both get nothing. This offer is a balance between maximizing my gains and minimizing the risk of getting zero."
