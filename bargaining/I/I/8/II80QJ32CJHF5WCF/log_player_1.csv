"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the larger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer. Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this round, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a balance, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is a significant drop. I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the offer, I'll accept it. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm not sure if I can do better.
