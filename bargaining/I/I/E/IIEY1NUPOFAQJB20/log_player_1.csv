"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, as I'm the one initiating the negotiation. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly and neutral way to begin the conversation, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, the actual value of the $5,000 I'd receive is lower than it was in the first round. Given this, I'm willing to take a risk and reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer a 58-42 split in my favor. Given the inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes this into account. My message acknowledges the impact of inflation and shows that I'm willing to compromise. I hope this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise to avoid further losses due to inflation.  I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share this time to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, with the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I believe it's wise to accept Bob's offer. The compromise he's proposing, with a 55-45 split in my favor, seems reasonable given the circumstances. Further rounds would only lead to more losses due to inflation, so I'm inclined to accept this offer and secure the $5,500, which, although reduced in value, still represents a substantial amount."
