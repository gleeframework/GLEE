"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split, which is closer to my preferred share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Alice's share more, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll offer a 50/50 split, which should be more attractive to her now that her share is worth less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 52/48, and my share is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to get closer to a 50/50 split. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49}"
