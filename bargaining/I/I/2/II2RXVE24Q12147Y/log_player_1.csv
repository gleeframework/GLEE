"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you get 20. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can have 60, and I'll take 40. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 60 is actually worth 48 (60 * 0.8) and Bob's gain of 40 is worth 36 (40 * 0.9).

I'm not thrilled about the 3:5 split, but it's an improvement over the previous offer. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
