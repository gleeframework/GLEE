Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  While it hurts both players, Alice is hit much harder by inflation.  Her 6000 is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. 
* **Better Than Previous:** This offer gives Bob more than his previous proposal, and Alice is likely desperate at this point. 

Let's see how this plays out!"
