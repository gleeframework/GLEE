"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good share, but I want more for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I now have $9,000 - 5% = $8,550 in effective value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept it. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low, I'd like to make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so my effective gain is $8,550 - 5% = $8,102.50.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, hoping he'll accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you an equal share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I now have $9,000 - 14.26% = $7,709.14 in effective value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd like to accept it. It's an equal split, and I'd rather not risk going further into the game.
