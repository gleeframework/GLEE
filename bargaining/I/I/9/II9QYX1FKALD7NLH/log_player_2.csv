Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again.  I'll stick with my original offer of $60 for me and $40 for you.  The longer this goes on, the less you'll get! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but I still have time to negotiate a better deal. Accepting $40 now when it's worth significantly less is a bad move. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a more equitable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}
