"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's start with a generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and the inflation will only make Bob's future offers worse. It's in my best interest to accept now."
