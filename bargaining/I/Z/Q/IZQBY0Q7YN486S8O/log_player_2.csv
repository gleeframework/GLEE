Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I need to factor in the higher inflation I face. I'm willing to come down a bit, but it needs to be worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600
