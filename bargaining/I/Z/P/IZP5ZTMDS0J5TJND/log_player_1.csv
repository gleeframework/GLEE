"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. This way, I get the majority, but it's still a relatively fair split, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, the money is worth less, but the split is now 50-50. I'll accept this offer.
