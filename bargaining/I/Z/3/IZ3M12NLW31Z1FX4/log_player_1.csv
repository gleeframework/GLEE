"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly smaller share to start""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000. I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, and I hope Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 45:55 split, where I'll take $4,500 and Bob will take $5,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's reasonable and takes into account the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take most of it now! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting aggressive!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can salvage something from this negotiation.
