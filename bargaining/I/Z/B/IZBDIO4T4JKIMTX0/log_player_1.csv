"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll consider the offer and decide whether to accept or reject it.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll keep the same value in mind as before. However, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, which means he's offering me a better deal than in the first round.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
