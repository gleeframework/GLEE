"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can have the rest. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively getting 47 (40 * 0.95).

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
