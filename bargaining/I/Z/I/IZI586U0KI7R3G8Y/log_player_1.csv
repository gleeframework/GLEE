"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

I'll think for a moment... Considering the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is actually worth 405,000 (10% less than 450,000), and Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 522,500 (5% less than 550,000).

I'll reject this offer. I want a better deal!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more aggressive split. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000

Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 480,000 is worth 362,400 (27.1% less than 500,000, which is 10% less than 1,000,000), and Bob's gain of 520,000 is worth 445,200 (14.26% less than 600,000, which is 5% less than 1,000,000).

Hmm... a 50-50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. Considering the inflation, I'm actually getting a better deal than I was in the first round. I think I'll take it.
