"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get a good starting point. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a better deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share. You can't blame me for trying! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the offer is slightly less than my previous proposal, it's still a good deal after inflation.  I'll take it!"
