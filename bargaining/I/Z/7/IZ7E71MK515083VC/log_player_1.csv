"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good starting point. I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less than before, I'll have to weigh the benefits of taking $5,000 now against the potential for a better offer in the next round.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping for a better deal, but I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share. You can't blame me for trying!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, hoping to take advantage of the reduced value of the money. My message is a bit cheeky, but I'm trying to negotiate a better deal."
