"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

For me, $5000 is now worth 95% of $6000, so it's a decrease of $300 from my previous offer. For Bob, $5000 is now worth 80% of $4000, so it's an increase of $400 from his previous offer.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is now:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the offer:

For me, $4,000 is now worth 85.74% of $6,000, so it's a decrease of $1,600 from my previous offer. For Bob, $6,000 is now worth 52.2% of $4,000, so it's an increase of $2,000 from his previous offer.

Considering this, I'll accept the offer.
