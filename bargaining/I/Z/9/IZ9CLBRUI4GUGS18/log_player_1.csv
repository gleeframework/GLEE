"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share now. I accept Bob's offer.
