"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and take 60% for me!

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a reasonable cut too. This offer ensures we both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The money loses value for me with each round. Accepting a bad deal now is worse than potentially getting a better deal later.
* **Fairness with Edge:** My offer is slightly in my favor, reflecting the time-pressure disadvantage I face. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message to Alice acknowledges her desire for a larger share while firmly stating my need for a fair portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous, take it! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Worsening Offer:** Alice's offer is even worse than her first one, taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me now.
* **Holding Strong:** Accepting a bad deal sets a bad precedent. It shows Alice I'm desperate and willing to take unfavorable terms.
* **Hope for a Better Deal:** While the inflation hurts, there's still a chance Alice will offer a more reasonable split to avoid risking getting nothing in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is a fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this and both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation is really hurting now.  Each round makes accepting even a marginally unfair deal more appealing. 
* **Finality:** Offering a 50/50 split is the strongest message I can send that I want a fair deal and won't be pushed further. 
* **Strategic Risk:** There's a risk Alice will reject this, hoping I panic and take a worse deal in Round 5. However, the 50/50 split is simple, logical, and puts the pressure on her to justify further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient. Take this and end it. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Critical Inflation:** The inflation is becoming a serious problem. Accepting even this unfavorable deal is better than risking getting a worse offer or even nothing in the next round.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The potential gains from continuing are outweighed by the increasing losses from inflation. My negotiating position is significantly weaker. 
* **Alice's Resolve:** Alice seems determined to get a larger share and is using the inflation to her advantage.  It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better than this. 

While it's not ideal, taking this offer cuts my losses and ensures I get something."
