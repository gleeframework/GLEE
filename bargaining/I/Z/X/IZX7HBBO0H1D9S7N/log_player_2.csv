"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair play! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to maximize my gain before the value decreases further. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since I'm taking the risk of inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Alice 45 dollars, while I take 55 dollars. My reasoning is that, since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I need to try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob. Let's end this before inflation eats away more of our gains. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round, I need to try to maximize my gain even more to compensate for the loss in value. I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get an even better offer. Let's continue!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, I need a better deal to make up for it!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my offer to 58 dollars for myself, while Alice gets 42 dollars. With the money now worth 14.26% less to me than in the first round (5% decrease per round, compounded), I'm feeling the pressure to get a better deal to make up for the loss in value. I'm hoping Alice will understand my position and accept this offer, but if not, I'll have to weigh my options carefully in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  We're both losing money with each round.  Let's settle before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (18.55% less than the initial value), I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer at this point. The difference between our proposed offers is relatively small, and the risk of losing more value in subsequent rounds outweighs the potential gain. Alice seems resolute in her message, indicating that this is her final offer. I'll take the 45 dollars, which, although not ideal, is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. It's time to settle and end the game!"
