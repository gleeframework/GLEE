I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, leaving a small amount for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as I get a huge share, and he'll get something, which is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much better for him, but I'm not willing to accept a 75% reduction in my share just yet. I believe I can do better in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money. Since Bob rejected my last offer, I hope he'll see that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering more to himself, and while this is an improvement from his last offer, I believe I can still get a better deal. Inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm not desperate yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping that with each round, Bob will realize that he needs to give me a fairer share if he wants to secure a deal before the remaining money becomes too small."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is starting to really hurt, and I'm getting closer to the end of the game.  I'm no longer in a position to hold out for a better deal. While I'd prefer to get more, this offer is at least fair and will give me a decent share of the money before it disappears."
