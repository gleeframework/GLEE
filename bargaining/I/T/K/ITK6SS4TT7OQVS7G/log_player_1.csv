"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'll try to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
