"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split, considering the uncertainty of inflation. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
