Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this is the best I can offer. Let's make a deal and avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains.
