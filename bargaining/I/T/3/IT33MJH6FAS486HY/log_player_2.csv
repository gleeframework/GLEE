Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob, but I'm not giving away too much! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation has hit hard, accepting this offer is the best option for Bob at this point. While he's getting significantly less than what he originally proposed,  rejecting the offer means facing even more drastic losses from inflation in the next round.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
