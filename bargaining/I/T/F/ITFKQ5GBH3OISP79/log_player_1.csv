"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, but it's a strategy to see if Bob is willing to accept a very small amount right away.  It's a bit of a gamble, but I think it's worth it to get the ball rolling!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting and potentially ending up with a worse offer later."
