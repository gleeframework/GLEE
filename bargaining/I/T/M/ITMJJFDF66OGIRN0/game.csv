900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, you drive a hard bargain, but time is literally money in this game. I'm offering you a larger share than last time.  Let's be practical and end this here before inflation hurts you further.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this back and forth is getting us nowhere. I'm serious about getting a fair share. Here's a compromise. It's less than my last offer but still a strong deal for both of us. Let's be done with this.",Bob,6,

800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, this is it.  My offer stands. It's clear you're aiming for a 60/40 split, but with each round, inflation eats away at your potential gain.  This is your last chance for a sizable share. Don't be stubborn to your detriment.",Alice,7,
