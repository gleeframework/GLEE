Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous, hoping to get this over with quickly. I think 90/10 is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation makes it risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting 50/50 is a fair outcome, especially considering the potential for further losses due to inflation."
