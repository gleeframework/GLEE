"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, which is a pretty aggressive start. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the original amount, I'll make a more modest proposal this time.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less, I'll consider Bob's offer. A 50:50 split is a reasonable proposal, especially considering the decreasing value of the money.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
