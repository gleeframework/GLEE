Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. Take it while it's still a good deal for you, considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair. We both need to compromise.  I'm offering you 40%, which is more than your previous proposal, but less than your desired 65%. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to being reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the accelerating inflation hitting her harder than me.  She's feeling the pressure to settle, and I can leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 55/45.  The inflation is eating away at your share faster, so take this chance to secure a decent amount.  It's a fair deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from round 2, showing a willingness to negotiate, but making it clear this is my bottom line.  The emphasis on the quickly devaluing money adds pressure on Alice to settle now."
