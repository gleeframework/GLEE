Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one! While unfair, time is working against me.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Inflation:** The value of my potential gains keeps decreasing.  
* **Alice's Stance:** She seems to be holding firm at a higher percentage for herself.
* **Future Rounds:**  If I reject this, there's no guarantee she'll offer even this much in future rounds, and the value will continue to decrease for me. 

It's better to take a smaller, but still somewhat reasonable, amount now than risk getting even less later."
