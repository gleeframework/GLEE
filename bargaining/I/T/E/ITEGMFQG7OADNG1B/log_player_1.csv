"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer, aiming for a big chunk of the money.  Since I get to propose first, I'm taking advantage of the fact that Bob's money will be worth less in the next round if he rejects. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, I'm going to reject this offer. My money is worth less in each round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I hold out. Let's see what Bob offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to stick with a strong offer, but I'm going to slightly adjust it.  I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm recognizing that Bob's offer shows he's willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this shows him I'm also willing to negotiate, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, and while 4000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a larger share.  With each round, the value of the money is dropping for me, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that I'm not going to settle for a small amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer again, but I'm still holding onto a significant majority of the money.  We're getting closer to the end of the game, and while the money is worth less for both of us, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally see that it's in his best interest to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable.  While I'm losing value with each round, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to hold out, hoping Bob will realize that he needs to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The pressure is mounting.  The money is worth significantly less for me now, but I'm still going to try to secure a good share.  I'm lowering my offer again, but hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair deal for both of us, considering the time constraints and the value of the money dropping.  If he rejects, we might both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. While I'm losing value with each round, I'm not going to accept such a small share. I still believe there's a chance to reach a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The money is rapidly losing value, and we're running out of time. It's the best offer I can make while still ensuring that I get a decent share. Hopefully, Bob will realize that it's the most reasonable way to avoid getting nothing."
