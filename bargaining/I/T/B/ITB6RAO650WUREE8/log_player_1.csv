"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less in this round, I need to consider the reduced value. Considering this, Bob's offer of $450,000 for me is actually worth $427,500 (450,000 * 0.95). Meanwhile, Bob's share of $550,000 is worth $495,000 (550,000 * 0.9) to him due to the 10% reduction. Given these adjusted values, I don't think the offer is fair enough for me to accept. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each round, we need to adjust the values accordingly.\n\nLet's assume the initial value is 1,000,000. After two rounds, the money I gain is worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value, and the money Bob gains is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.\n\nConsidering this, I'll make an offer where I take 570,000 (which is worth approximately 514,425 to me) and Bob gets 430,000 (which is worth approximately 348,300 to him).\n\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's recalculate the split""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
