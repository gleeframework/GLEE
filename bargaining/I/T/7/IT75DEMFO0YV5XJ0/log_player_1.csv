"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for my next proposal!

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about getting such a small amount. However, the alternative is to continue playing and risk getting even less in future rounds. Given the significant drop in value, I'll take what I can get.
