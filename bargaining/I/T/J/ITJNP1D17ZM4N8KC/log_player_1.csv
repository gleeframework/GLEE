"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with an even split. This way, we can avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation, and we can build a fairer agreement from there. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
