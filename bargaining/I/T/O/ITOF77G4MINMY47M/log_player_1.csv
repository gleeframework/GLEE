"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is fairer considering the inflation. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, considering the inflation, but I still think I deserve a larger share.""}\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, considering the inflation, but I still think I deserve a larger share.""}\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's clear we both value our share, but the longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for you. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. The inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential gain, and I don't think I can negotiate a better deal at this point. Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'd rather take the 4900 now than risk losing more value in future rounds."
