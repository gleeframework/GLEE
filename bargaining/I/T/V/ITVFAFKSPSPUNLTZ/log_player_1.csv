Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting since it's better than what I proposed, but it's still skewed in Bob's favor. I need to counter with something that incentivizes him to accept before inflation eats into my potential gains too much.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is closer to your proposal, but with a slight advantage for me. Given the inflation, it makes sense to settle this sooner rather than later.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is a good compromise, Alice.  It acknowledges the time pressure from inflation while aiming for a fairer split.  Let's close this deal and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tricky. Bob is clearly aiming for a slightly advantageous split, and while this offer is closer to even, it's still not in my favor. However, inflation is starting to become a significant factor. Accepting now would still give me more than I countered with last round.
