"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'd rather wait for a better offer. My current offer was 60% of the initial amount, and Bob's offer is 50% of the current amount. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This way, I'll get 48% of the current value, and Bob will get 52%. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
