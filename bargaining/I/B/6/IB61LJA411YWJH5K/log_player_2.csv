"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer aims to balance our shares while considering the potential inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since the money loses 10% of its value each round, accepting a 40/60 split in the first round means getting significantly less in real terms if the game goes on for several rounds.  It's better to reject and see if Alice's offer improves in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a more balanced approach than your previous offer, acknowledging the potential inflation but still giving you a fair share.""}
