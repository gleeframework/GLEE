I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 1:9 ratio, especially since I know the money is worth less due to inflation.
