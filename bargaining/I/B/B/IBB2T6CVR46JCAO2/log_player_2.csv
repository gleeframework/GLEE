Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating our potential gains. This offer is a good compromise. Don't let greed get the best of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is eating into our potential gains, but she's using that as leverage to offer me increasingly worse deals.  I need to hold firm and demonstrate I'm willing to walk away, otherwise she'll keep lowballing me."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we're running out of time!  This offer is my final attempt to meet you somewhere in the middle. It's a deal we can both live with. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but she's still trying to take advantage of the situation. It's unlikely she'll offer me anything significantly better in the remaining rounds. I need to call her bluff and demonstrate I'm serious about walking away. This will hopefully push her towards a more reasonable offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're running out of time, and this is the best I can offer.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law. By offering a slightly lower amount than my previous offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about my position and willing to walk away. The message is blunt and leaves no room for interpretation.  Alice is running out of options and will likely accept this offer rather than risk losing everything."
