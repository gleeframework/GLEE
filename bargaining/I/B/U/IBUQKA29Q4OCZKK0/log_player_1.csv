"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that tries to persuade him to accept. Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer of $40 for me would be equivalent to $32 in the original value, and his $60 would be equivalent to $54 in the original value.

Given this, I don't think the offer is fair enough for me. I'll reject it and try to make a better offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation""
}


I'm taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable for both of us. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
