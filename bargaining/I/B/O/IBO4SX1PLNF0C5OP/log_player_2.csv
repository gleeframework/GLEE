Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, but I still think I can get a bit more. This is my most generous offer yet, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, and her offers are getting worse for me with each round.  While time is running out, I need to hold firm. Accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half, even with the inflation, sets a bad precedent and signals I'm desperate.  There's a chance Alice will panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer something more reasonable."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's end this now with a clean, fair 50/50 split.  Otherwise, we both lose.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Firm Stance:**  Continuously going back and forth with gradually shifting offers isn't productive. A firm 50/50 proposal shows I'm serious about a fair deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal has diminishing returns. The risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly with each passing round."
