Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make an offer that takes into account the 5% decrease in value for me. Since the money is worth less for me now, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, Bob, but I'm still willing to split it more evenly than your offer. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven that the money is now worth 9.75% less for me than in the first round, I need to consider whether Alice's offer compensates enough for this loss in value. Her offer of a 45-55 split does not favor me, especially considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I will reject this offer in hopes of negotiating a better split in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the money is now worth 14.26% less for me (compounding the 5% decrease each round), I'll adjust my offer to try and find a balance that compensates for this loss. Given Alice's last offer and my need for a better split due to inflation, I'll aim for a division that slightly favors me more than my previous offer but is still reasonable for Alice.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I believe this split is more equitable.""}"
