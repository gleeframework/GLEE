"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts would be:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

I think this is a fair compromise, so I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
