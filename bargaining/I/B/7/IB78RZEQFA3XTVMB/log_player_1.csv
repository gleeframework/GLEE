"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm letting Bob know that it's his turn next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful. Taking 40% of the current value of the money is actually a pretty good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
