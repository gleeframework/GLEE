"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we should settle on this division to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need a bit more. This is my counter offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I initially offered Bob $4000 and he rejected it, and now he's offering me $4500 while taking $5500 for himself, I still think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation doesn't affect me, I have the upper hand in waiting. I'll reject this offer to see if I can negotiate a better split in the next rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself. Given that inflation affects Bob's gains and not mine, I've slightly adjusted the offer to still appear reasonable but also to my advantage. The message ""Consider the inflation"" aims to remind Bob that waiting further will only decrease the value of his potential gain, hopefully prompting him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a better deal for you than last round considering the inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation affecting Bob's gain, he's still offering me less than what I think I can get. Since his gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round and he's offering me only $4900, which is less than my initial offer of $6000 for myself, I believe there's room for further negotiation. The fact that inflation doesn't affect my gain gives me leverage to wait for a potentially better deal in the next rounds. Let's proceed to see if Bob becomes more willing to compromise as the value of his potential gain continues to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, settle now""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4300 and keep $5700 for myself. The message ""Inflation is biting, settle now"" is intended to pressure Bob into accepting this deal by highlighting the ongoing devaluation of his potential gain due to inflation. Since Bob's portion is now worth significantly less than at the start, and mine remains unaffected, I'm trying to persuade him that accepting this offer is in his best interest before the value of his share decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground, but we need to consider the impact of inflation on my end. This offer is a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's attempt to meet me closer to the middle ground, the impact of inflation on his end means that the actual value he's getting is significantly less than what the numbers suggest. Given that my gain remains unaffected by inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Bob's willingness to compromise is a good sign, but I think there's room for further negotiation, especially considering the increasing pressure of inflation on his potential gain. Let's proceed to see if Bob becomes even more willing to compromise in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's too late""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4400 and keep $5600 for myself. The message ""Last chance before it's too late"" is meant to convey a sense of urgency, emphasizing that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, the value of his potential gain will continue to decrease drastically due to inflation, and he might end up with much less or even nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. I'm trying to leverage the pressure of the game's time limit and the impact of inflation to persuade Bob to accept this deal."
