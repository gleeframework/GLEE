Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I want to secure a good portion of the money early on, but I'm also being mindful of the fact that Bob might reject this and make a counter-offer. We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer and I don't want to risk losing even more money to inflation. Accepting this deal is the best way to ensure I get something."
