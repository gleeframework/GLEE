"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm hoping you'll come back with a better offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $70, which is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping for a bit more. I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 30% of the total.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. 60/40 seems fair, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up more, but I think 75% of the total is a bit too much. Let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is a significant increase from his previous one! With inflation, the money is worth less for Bob, so he's giving up more of his share.

I'll consider this offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 25% of the total. I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering it, I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take 75% of the total. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to call it a day.""
}
```"
