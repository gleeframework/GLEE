"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't get a better deal than this! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm getting less than half of the original amount.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 400,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
