"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can go grab a coffee""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the coffee!"
