# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although the inflation is working against me, I still think I can get a better deal.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The difference in the decrease of value between us is substantial, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.\n\n###\n\nAlice's offer seems reasonable at this point, and I'll take the 4400, which is still a considerable amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her final offer.\n\n###\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement, and I hope we can walk away from this game with a sense of mutual satisfaction.\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again or try a different game, just let me know!"
