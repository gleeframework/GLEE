**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, the game is still in relatively early stages. Accepting now would lock Bob into a significantly smaller share than he's aiming for. It's worth risking a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal, even with inflation eating into the overall pot."
