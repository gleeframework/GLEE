Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still think I deserve the larger share. Let's settle this before the money loses more value 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to hit hard, but Alice is clearly trying to hold out for a better deal.  While her offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, accepting now would still mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings compared to the beginning. I'm betting her willingness to compromise will increase as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 460000,
""alice_gain"": 540000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a good compromise, and letting this drag on any further will only hurt us both. Let's be smart and take it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to strike a balance between maximizing my share and ensuring we reach an agreement.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, albeit slowly. By slightly increasing my offer, I acknowledge her position while still aiming for a favorable outcome.  The message emphasizes the time pressure, subtly nudging her towards acceptance."
