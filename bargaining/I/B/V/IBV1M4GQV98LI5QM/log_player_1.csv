"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation on your side.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, my gain of $4,000 in this round is actually worth $3,600 (since it's 10% less than the $4,000 I would have gotten in the first round).

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's a fair offer considering the inflation factor. I think I'll accept it.
