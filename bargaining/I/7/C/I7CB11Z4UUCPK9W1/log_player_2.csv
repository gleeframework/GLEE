Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure. It's in your best interest to accept now before inflation eats further into your share. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000

``` 

I'm very reluctant to accept this, but it's the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains.
