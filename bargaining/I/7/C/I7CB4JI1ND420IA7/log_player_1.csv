"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'll have to deal with the inflation that will affect my share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my share of $7,000 in this round is actually worth more than my initial offer of $8,000 in the first round. I'll accept this offer.
