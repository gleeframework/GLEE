Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're playing hardball, but I'm not willing to go much lower. This is my final offer, if you reject it, we both lose more. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is getting more desperate to make a deal.  I need to hold firm to get a better offer. While his offer isn't terrible, I believe I can still push him further in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but this is my final offer. Let's end this before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is acceptable. While I'd prefer a higher share, Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and there's a real risk he'll lowball me in a later round out of fear of getting nothing. This deal secures a significant majority of the money while avoiding the risk of walking away with nothing."
