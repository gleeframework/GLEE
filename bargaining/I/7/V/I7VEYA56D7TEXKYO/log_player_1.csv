"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the higher amount, it's only fair since the money loses value over time.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a majority, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I proposed in the first round, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share to maintain some purchasing power.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, but still giving Bob a larger share. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me significantly less than I proposed in the previous rounds, considering the rapid inflation. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to make sure I'm not getting taken advantage of by inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still giving Bob a significant share. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
