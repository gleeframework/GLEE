"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer gives us both a good share. Let's settle it now and avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer. While it seems like a good deal at first, the inflation rates are very different for us. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split that accounts for our different inflation rates. This way, we both get a significant portion of the money, and we avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose with every round. This offer still gives you a significant amount, and it's better than what we'll have left if we wait much longer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer ensures I get a sizable portion of the money, and it's better than risking further losses."
