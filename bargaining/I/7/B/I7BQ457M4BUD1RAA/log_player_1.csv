"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk, so I'm keeping a large portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation risk is too high to reject this offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better to secure half of the shrinking pot than risk getting nothing."
