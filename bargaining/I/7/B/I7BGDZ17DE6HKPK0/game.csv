6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  What do you say?",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation factor will affect me more than you. Let's settle this now.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm feeling the inflation pinch already. How about a compromise? $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this offer is the most balanced you'll get, considering the inflation working against me. $5,200 for me, $4,800 for you.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, it's clear we're both feeling the pressure of inflation.  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I get at least $5,300 to make this worthwhile. Let's make a deal!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of the inflation.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. $5,000 each.",Alice,7,
