"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 60/40 is a good starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to counter with 55/45 in my favor. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like a slightly bigger share.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer. I think 55/45 is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm trying to hold my ground and get a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further. 52/48 seems like a reasonable split, considering the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original, I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 52/48 is a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'd rather get something than risk going into further rounds and potentially getting even less."
