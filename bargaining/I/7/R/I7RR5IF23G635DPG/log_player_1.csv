Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a better compromise. This offer is fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's break it down:

* **Bob's Offer:**  He's offering me $4000 while he takes $6000. This is the reverse of my offer, and heavily favors him.
* **Inflation:** This is the crucial factor.  While the nominal amounts are the same as Round 1, the money is worth less now. My potential gain is declining faster than his.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to stall. He's hoping that as inflation eats into the value, I'll get desperate and accept a bad offer. Rejecting keeps the pressure on him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, and it's literally costing us both. I'm offering a compromise to close this out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to the middle ground, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be walked over.
* **Time Pressure:** Highlighting the inflation factor puts pressure on Bob to settle quickly. He's losing value too, even if it's at a slower rate.  
* **Clarity:** The message is direct and avoids any ambiguity that could lead to further stalling."
