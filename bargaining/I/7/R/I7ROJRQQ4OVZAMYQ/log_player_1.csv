# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair.  Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a compromise, Alice. This is a fair split considering inflation is working against you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  While the deal is getting worse, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than half of the initial amount."
