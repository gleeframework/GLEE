"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. I get slightly more since I proposed. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next.  It's worth taking the risk and seeing if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, as I'm now making the proposal. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This is a slight adjustment to my previous offer, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor now. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not drastically different from the initial offer."
