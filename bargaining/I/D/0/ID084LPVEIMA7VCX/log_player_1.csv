"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, $500,000 is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'm also considering the fact that Bob's share is equal to mine, which might be a sign that he's trying to negotiate a fair split.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.
