"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage this time to show good faith. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too pleased with the slight disadvantage in the offer, but I appreciate the good faith gesture.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer, considering the inflation and the slight disadvantage in Bob's proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more this time.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
