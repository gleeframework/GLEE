"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer. In this case, I'd be getting $4,000, which is 80% of $5,000.

I'll reject this offer since I'd prefer to wait for a better deal, considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was $6,000 for him and $4,000 for me, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800 and keeping $4,200 for myself, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation."
