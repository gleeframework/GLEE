Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a more even split is fairer given the potential for inflation. Let's go for a 51/49 split in my favor this time, as I am the one making the offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
