"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to do slightly better. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! Okay, I'll think carefully... My previous offer was 420,000, and Alice rejected it. This offer is slightly worse, but only by 10,000. I'm not sure if Alice will improve her offer in the next round, so I'll accept this one.
