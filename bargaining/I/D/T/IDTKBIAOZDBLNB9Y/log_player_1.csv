Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose an 80/20 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the risk of inflation, and allows us to both get a significant share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
