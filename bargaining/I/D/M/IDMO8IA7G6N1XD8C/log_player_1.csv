"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but it aims to secure a large portion of the money before inflation can significantly devalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I've lowered my offer slightly to account for the inflation and to make it more appealing to Bob.  I want to secure a good portion of the money before it's worth even less!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although the inflation has hit hard, it's likely that the next round will be even worse for me.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid risking getting a much lower share in the future."
