``` 
At this point, it's clear that Bob is trying to take as much money as possible, and the inflation is heavily favoring him. It's not worthwhile for Alice to accept an offer with such a small amount of money.  The game is a losing proposition for her at this point."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 94, ""bob_gain"": 6}
``` 

Alice is taking a risk here.  While the inflation is still hurting Bob, he's likely to accept this offer as it's much better than what he was getting previously. It's a gamble that Bob will see the value in settling the game rather than continuing to risk the further decline in his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice should reject this offer. While Bob is getting a much larger share due to the inflation, it's still a risky proposition for Alice.  She's better off continuing to play and hoping to secure a more favorable deal in the next round.  At this point, the game is truly a gamble for both players."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 12.
Round 13
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 93, ""bob_gain"": 7}
```

Alice is pushing her luck here, offering a slightly better deal than the previous round, but still keeping a significant portion of the money.  It's a risky move as it's still a very small amount for Bob, but the inflation is making each round more perilous for him. It's a last-ditch effort to get Bob to settle before the next round, where the money he gains will be worth even less."
