"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation to devalue the money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical move. Inflation is a significant factor, and taking 5000$ now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
