"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'm getting a slightly better deal this round. However, I'm still getting a relatively equal split, which is a good opportunity to get a better outcome for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
