"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm aiming for a slightly larger share for myself to make up for the lost value due to inflation."
