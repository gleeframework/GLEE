"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll consider the actual amount I'd gain as $45 (70 * 0.9 = 63 * 0.9 = 56.7 * 0.9 = 50.83 * 0.9 = 45.74... approx 45.7).

I'll accept Bob's offer.
