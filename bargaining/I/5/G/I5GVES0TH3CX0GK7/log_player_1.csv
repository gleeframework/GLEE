"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get a smaller share, but we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're offering me a low share, so I'm offering you a low share too. You might want to reconsider my offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to back down that easily. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer was already quite generous to me, I'll try to take a more moderate approach this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. Let's split it 42-58. It's a fair deal, and we can end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is closer to the middle ground, but still slightly biased towards me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about ending this. I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not happy about it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more even split, but his message suggests he's not entirely happy about it. I'll consider this offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the extra 1,200$ I could get if I wait another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll try to make a stronger case for myself. I'll propose a slightly higher share, but still not too high, since I don't want to scare Bob off.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's split it 55-45. It's a fair deal, and we can end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still relatively close to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting more aggressive with the offers, but I'm not getting more generous. I'll stick to my original plan. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns, and I'm not getting any closer to getting a better deal. At this point, I think it's worth accepting his offer, since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round.
