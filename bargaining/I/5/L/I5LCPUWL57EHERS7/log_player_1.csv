"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable and fair proposal. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement as soon as possible. By giving Bob a significant share, I'm hoping he'll be inclined to accept and we can conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better split. Accepting this offer would mean I'm getting only 30% of the original amount, which is significantly less than what I initially proposed. Since the game is still in its early stages, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable offer or to make a counteroffer that will sway Bob into accepting a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for me. Given that Bob's previous offer was too skewed in his favor, I'm trying to find a middle ground. By offering a split that is closer to 50-50 but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on my share, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. The goal is to end the game as soon as possible to minimize further loss of value."
