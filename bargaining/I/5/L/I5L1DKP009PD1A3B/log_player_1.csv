"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. The message I'm sending to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"", implying that I'm giving him a reasonable share and we can end the game quickly without losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's find a more equitable solution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although he's trying to negotiate for a more equitable solution, his proposed split of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for himself is the opposite of what I initially offered, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same for me, I have no incentive to accept a lower amount. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $420,000 and keep $580,000 for myself. The message I'm sending to Bob is ""Meet me in the middle"", implying that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. I've decreased my share slightly from the initial offer, hoping that Bob will see this as a gesture of good faith and be more willing to accept."
