**Reasoning:**

The game has strong elements of a ""melting ice cube"" scenario for Bob.  Here's why I made this decision:

* **Inflation's Bite:** Every round, the value of the money significantly decreases for Bob.  Waiting means getting a smaller and smaller slice of a shrinking pie.
* **Alice's Advantage:** Alice isn't affected by inflation, so she's incentivized to wait for Bob to become more desperate.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's offers are getting closer to a 50/50 split, but the value he loses to inflation outweighs the potential gains from holding out for a slightly better deal.

While $430,000 is much less than what Bob could have gotten in Round 1, it's the best offer he's likely to receive at this point. Continuing to reject offers will likely lead to even worse outcomes for him as the value diminishes further."
