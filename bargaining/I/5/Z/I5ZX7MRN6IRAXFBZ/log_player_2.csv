"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal, given the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think we can do better than 50/50.  I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm confident we can both come out ahead with this deal."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. This way, we can both benefit from the negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation means my share is worth significantly less than it would have been in the first round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a portion of the money, which is better than risking getting nothing due to further inflation and rejection."
