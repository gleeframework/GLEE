Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, as Bob is getting 55% of the total amount.

I'll decide to...

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a bit more reasonable now. The money he gains is worth less due to inflation, so his proposed 52% share is actually a bit more generous.

However, I'm still not thrilled about the uneven split. I'll decide to...
