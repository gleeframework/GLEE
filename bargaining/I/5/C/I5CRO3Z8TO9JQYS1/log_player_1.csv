"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll have to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation is still affecting the money, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly better split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
