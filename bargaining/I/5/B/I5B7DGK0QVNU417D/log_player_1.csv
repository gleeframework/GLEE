"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to be fair, but I'm also looking out for my own interests.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is a bit more appealing, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous on your part, Bob. I think I can do better than that. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less again, so the total amount is now 9,000$. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I think this split is fair and gives us both a good deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. We're both losing money with each round, and this is getting nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  Let's call it a day and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate and wants to end the game. A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd rather try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to settle for 50/50 just yet, Bob. I'd like to try to get a bit more. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to give away too much. I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
