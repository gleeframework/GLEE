"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering that I am the one making the first proposal. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, taking into account the inflation that will affect us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe that the split is still not fair, considering the inflation rates. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I am effectively getting less value than the numbers suggest. I want to make a counteroffer that takes into account the different inflation rates and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation!""}\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob 30% of the money and keeping 70% for myself. Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I believe this offer is more reasonable. The message ""Consider the inflation!"" is intended to remind Bob of the different inflation rates and how they affect the value of the money we receive. I hope this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  We both need to consider the inflation, but this split is still fair. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI am accepting Bob's offer in this round. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for my share which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I believe that meeting in the middle as Bob suggests is a reasonable compromise. The split of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for Bob, considering the inflation, seems fair at this point in the game. Continuing to reject offers and proceeding to further rounds would likely result in even less value for both of us, so I decide to accept this offer and conclude the game."
