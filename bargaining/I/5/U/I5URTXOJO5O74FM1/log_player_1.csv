"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars and let Bob have 1 dollar. This is a classic strategy to ensure I get the most money, as any further rounds could lead to a lower amount for me due to the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, it is a gamble to reject this offer.  Bob is offering a 50/50 split, and while inflation might be a factor, I am not certain how much it affects him, or even if it affects him at all. This seems like the most reasonable option to ensure I get at least half of the money."
