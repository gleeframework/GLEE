"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the total amount. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4750.

I'll consider Bob's offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I agree with your reasoning, Bob. I think a 50/50 split is a bit too generous for you. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation again, my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4750, and Bob's gain of $5000 is still worth $5000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise considering the inflation. I'm not willing to give up too much more. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Initial $10,000 is worth 95% of its original value after 3 rounds of inflation (1 - 0.05)^3 = 0.857375, or 85.7375% of the original value.

So, my gain of $4800 is actually worth $4800 * 0.857375 = $4115.40.

Considering the values, I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not happy with the terms, Bob. I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 85.74% of its original value, my gain of $4800 is actually worth $4115.40.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the remaining difference and finalize the deal.""
}
```"
