"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount to try to negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is the same as mine in Round 1, and I'm now getting a worse deal due to inflation, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was to give me $40, which is a bit more than my initial offer, I'll try to increase the amount I offer to Bob. However, I'll also try to get a better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob a bit more than he offered me last round, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
