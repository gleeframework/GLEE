"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount and can end the game quickly.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be a bit more aggressive. I'll give you 50, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's aggressive offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $50, hoping that he'll be more reasonable in future rounds."
