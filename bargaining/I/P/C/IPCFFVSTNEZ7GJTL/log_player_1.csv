Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split. We can both get a good amount, and we'll save time by not going through more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Although not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Waiting further rounds significantly devalues the money. 
* **Slightly Worse Offer:**  While Bob's offer is slightly worse than what I proposed, it's still a reasonable split. Accepting ensures I get a decent amount now. 
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob might propose even less favorable splits."
