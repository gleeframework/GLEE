"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Since I'm getting 70% of the original amount, and Bob is getting 30%, it's a slightly more favorable offer for me than the previous one. I'll accept this offer.
