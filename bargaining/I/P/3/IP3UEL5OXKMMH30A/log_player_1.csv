"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a terrible offer!  While I understand Bob is trying to get a better deal, this is extremely unfair.  I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split, which is much fairer than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise, especially considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. I'm willing to continue negotiating to get a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500} 
```

I'm willing to concede a bit more to try and reach an agreement. This offer gives Bob a slight majority, but it's still closer to a 50/50 split than his previous offers.  With inflation continuing, we need to find a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision, but with inflation continuing, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting. While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer guarantees me at least some gain."
