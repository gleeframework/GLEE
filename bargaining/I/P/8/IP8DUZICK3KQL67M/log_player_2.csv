**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, considering the inflation, Alice's offer is getting closer to 50/50. This is the best I can get at this point.  

**It's important to consider:**

* **Inflation:**  My gains stay the same, but Alice's are significantly decreasing with each round. This means the further we go, the less she will be willing to give up.
* **Risk:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance she'll make a counter-offer that's even worse for me. 
* **Potential for deadlock:**  We could keep rejecting offers, and the value of the money will keep decreasing.  

Accepting is the most logical move to secure some of the money and avoid further losses."
