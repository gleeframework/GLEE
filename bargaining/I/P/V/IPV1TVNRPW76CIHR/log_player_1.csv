"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, which is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round before the inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 4:1 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $180,000.

I'm not thrilled with the 4:1 split, but I think it's a good opportunity to get some money before the value of the remaining amount continues to decrease. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
