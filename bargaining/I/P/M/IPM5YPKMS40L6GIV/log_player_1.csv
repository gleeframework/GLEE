"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly uneven split, aiming to get a good deal while also being fair. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split this time. Since we've both rejected offers, I think it's time to be fair and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less now, I'm going to accept this offer. Bob has been stubborn, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round.  I'm willing to take the 45 dollars, rather than risk getting nothing at all."
