"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but you have to negotiate harder if you want more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less now, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob's offer is 40, that's 40 * 0.8 = 32 in real value. Not bad, but I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% of the original value), I'll aim for a higher share.

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 45, but I'm not getting any lower""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll give you less than 50, but I'm not getting less than 35! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! With the money being worth 51.2% of its original value now (80% of 64% of the original value), 35 is actually a decent offer in real value, which is 35 * 0.512 = 17.92.

However, I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll try to squeeze a bit more.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, so I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll! With the money being worth 32.77% of its original value now (80% of 40.96% of the original value), 30 is actually a relatively decent offer in real value, which is 30 * 0.3277 = 9.83.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now. With the money being worth 20.97% of its original value (80% of 25.64% of the original value), 20 is actually a pretty meager offer in real value, which is 20 * 0.2097 = 4.194.

I'm not going to get much better than this, and I'm running out of time. I'll take what I can get.
