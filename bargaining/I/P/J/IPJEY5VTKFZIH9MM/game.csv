50.0,50.0,Let's start fair. 50/50 split seems like the best way to go.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's be realistic, Alice. I make the proposals in even rounds, and the value decreases for me over time. This is a good deal for you now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I don't think your offer was fair. Let's split it closer to 55/45, where we both get a decent share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
44.0,56.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking, and every round costs us. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"I understand the time pressure, but I'm not going to accept a deal that's increasingly unfair to me.  Let's split it 60/40.  It's a better deal for both of us than the current trend.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but the decreasing value is making this difficult. This is a compromise, and we need to agree soon.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
65.0,35.0,"I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that gives me less than 65%. Let's split it 65/35. It's a reasonable compromise, considering the time.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're running out of time, and I'm making a significant concession by offering a 50/50 split despite the inflation. Let's end this now and both get something.",Bob,8,
