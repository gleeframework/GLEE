Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy approach here, hoping Bob might accept a small share in the first round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's tempting to try and keep bargaining, the inflation factor is a huge unknown.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and Bob has shown he's willing to play hardball. Taking $1 is better than risking getting nothing at all."
