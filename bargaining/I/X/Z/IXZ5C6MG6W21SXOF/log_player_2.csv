Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you're feeling ambitious. Let's compromise. I'll take 55, and you get 45. This way, we both still get a decent amount, and we avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
