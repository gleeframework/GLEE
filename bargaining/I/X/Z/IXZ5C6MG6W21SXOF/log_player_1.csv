Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time, since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. We both get more money this way in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
