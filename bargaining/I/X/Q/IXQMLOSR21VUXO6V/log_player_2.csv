"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, but I'm not going to accept a 40/60 split right off the bat."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer to avoid risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and the chance of getting a better deal in the next few rounds is slim."
