Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to accept a lower share, but I need more than this to make it worthwhile. We need to reach a compromise before the inflation eats away at my share even more. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are getting better for Bob. While this is the same offer as Round 2, we're now two rounds closer to Alice losing a significant chunk of value. Holding out a bit longer is still the best strategy for Bob."
