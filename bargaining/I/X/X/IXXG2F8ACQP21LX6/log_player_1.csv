"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of the original $6,000 I proposed, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $4,000 he would have gotten.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll accept the offer to end the game.
