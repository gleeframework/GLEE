"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to revisit the same split!

Considering the inflation effect, I think I can do better than the original 40-60 split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 40 is enough for me, considering the original proposal was 60. Can we meet in the middle at 55-45?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a new split of 55-45, which is closer to my original proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the inflation."
