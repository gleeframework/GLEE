Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an 80/20 split in my favor.  While the money is losing value with each round, I'm hoping we can find a solution that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
