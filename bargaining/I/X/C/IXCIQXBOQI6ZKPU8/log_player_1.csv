Round 4

**Reasoning:** 

While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor.  It's likely he's banking on me panicking about the decreasing value and accepting a bad deal. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even with the inflation penalty."
