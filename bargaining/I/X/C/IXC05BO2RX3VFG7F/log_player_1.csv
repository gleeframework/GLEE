"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll get a bit more for being the first to propose.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the 100$ and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, given that I get to make the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no more, no less 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll be getting $64 (80% of 80). Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'll be getting $47.50 (50% of 95).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the 50:50 split, as it's a fair and reasonable offer."
