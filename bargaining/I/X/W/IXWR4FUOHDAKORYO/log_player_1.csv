"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave something for Bob to make the game worthwhile for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're being a bit greedy, Alice. Let's try to find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $5,400.

I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than mine, but I'm still not willing to give up that much. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so I'll aim to get a bit more this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more to make this worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up that much more, Alice. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,800 is worth 68.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to about $6,896.

I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, and I'm starting to get a bit desperate to get a deal done. I'll accept his offer.
