Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  While time pressure is increasing, accepting a bad deal isn't the solution. I need to show Alice I'm serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play strong.  By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating: 
* **Fairness:**  It's clearly the most equitable division.
* **Resolve:** I'm willing to risk it all for a fair deal.

This puts the pressure on Alice. She can either accept a fair deal now or risk getting a worse outcome later as inflation eats away at the value."
