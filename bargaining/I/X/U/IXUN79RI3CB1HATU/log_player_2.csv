Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, every round hurts you more, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  While the offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor and doesn't reflect the increasing pressure on me. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not intimidated by your threat. The longer we play, the more you lose. I'm still willing to give you a reasonable share, but don't expect me to go any lower. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly playing hardball.  Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is eating into my potential gains.
* **Alice's Resolve:** She doesn't seem scared of my threats and might be calling my bluff.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, there's a chance she'll offer even less next time, banking on my desperation as we approach round 12.

It's risky, but I can't afford to let this drag on much longer.  I need to call her bluff and show I'm willing to walk away.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm hoping this finally pushes Alice to negotiate more realistically."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll take what you can get at this point. This is my offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, and time is running out.  Here's the dilemma:

* **Accepting:**  It's not a good deal, especially with the inflation, but it's better than nothing. 
* **Rejecting:**  I might be able to force a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds, but Alice might not budge, and we'll both lose everything.

This is incredibly risky, but I have to call her bluff one last time.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Let's hope this forces her hand. If not, I may have to swallow a very bitter pill in the next round or two."

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've been consistent in my offers, and you've been consistently rejecting them. I think you're bluffing about walking away. I'll give you one last chance to accept a reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is incredibly stubborn and playing a dangerous game.  Let's analyze the situation:

* **Time:** This is the second to last round. If I reject, and she doesn't budge in the final round, we both get nothing.
* **Alice's Pattern:** Her offers have remained largely consistent. There's a chance she's not bluffing and won't go any higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting carries a massive risk of getting nothing. Accepting guarantees a less than ideal, but still substantial, sum.

This is incredibly frustrating, but I can't risk it all on a bluff that might not pay off. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice played hardball, and while it's not the deal I wanted, it's better than walking away empty-handed."
