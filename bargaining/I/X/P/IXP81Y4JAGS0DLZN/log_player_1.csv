"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise given the decreasing value of the money. Let's end this now and both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
