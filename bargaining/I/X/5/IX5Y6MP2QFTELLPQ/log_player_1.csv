Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even with inflation. I'm going to reject this and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to propose a split that's closer to what I originally offered.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that we're not going to get much if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial offer, but with inflation, my gains are significantly lower.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
