"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start with a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a small portion. I'm hoping he'll accept it early on, rather than risk seeing the money shrink in value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is unfair, and while I'm losing value with each round, I'm not desperate enough to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger portion, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'll increase Bob's share slightly, hoping this will be more appealing than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm still not willing to accept such an unequal split.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm still trying to negotiate a fair deal. This offer gives Bob a larger share, but I'm hoping he'll recognize the increasing value of his share if he rejects and we continue to play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to bite. This is still a better deal for Bob, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out without seeing a significant loss. I'll accept this offer and hopefully avoid losing even more."
