"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob, I have an advantage in waiting. However, starting with a more even offer might encourage Bob to accept early, considering the significant decrease in value for him if he waits. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to fairness, although the offer is slightly skewed in my favor, reflecting the asymmetry in the value decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although he's being ""generous"" by offering me 45% of the money, considering the inflation doesn't affect me but significantly impacts him, I believe I can get a better deal if I wait. In the next round, the money will be worth even less to Bob, which might encourage him to offer me a larger share or accept a less favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the future value""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my share to 65% and decrease Bob's share to 35%. Given that the value of money for Bob decreases by 20% each round, I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting this offer is better than waiting for another round, where his potential gain would decrease even further. The message ""Consider the future value"" is meant to remind him of the impact of inflation on his share if he chooses to wait."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Despite his claim that this is his last offer, the fact that the money's value decreases significantly for him with each round puts pressure on him to settle. Given that I'm not affected by inflation, waiting another round might push Bob to accept an even less favorable deal due to the diminishing value of his potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Final offer, inflation hurts""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my share to 70% and decrease Bob's share to 30%. At this point, Bob has seen the value of his potential gain decrease significantly due to inflation. Given that I've rejected his ""last offer,"" I'm betting that he'll realize further resistance will only decrease his share's value even more. The message ""Final offer, inflation hurts"" is meant to drive home the impact of waiting further and to convey that I'm not willing to compromise much more."
