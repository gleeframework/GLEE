Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. We both lose money each round, so the longer we go, the less we both get.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it gives us the best chance to actually get something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
