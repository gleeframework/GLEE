# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. The difference between 5500 and 5200 is not that significant, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting a worse deal due to further inflation."
