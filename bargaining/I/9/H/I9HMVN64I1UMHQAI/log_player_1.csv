"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 70/30 split in my favor, as I'm taking the risk of continuing.  This is a fair compromise, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
