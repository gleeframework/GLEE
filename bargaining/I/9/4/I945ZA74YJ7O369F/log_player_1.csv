Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can both benefit from the reduced inflation later. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
