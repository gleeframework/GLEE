"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to split it down the middle, but I think I deserve more, don't you? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! My gain of $6000 is still worth the same, but Bob's gain of $4000 is now worth $3200 due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is too generous to himself, considering the inflation effect. I'm hoping he'll come back with a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation effect. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, but I'm not giving away too much. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving away too much? I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite a change from his previous one! Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth only $3120, which is a significant decrease. My gain of $7000 is still worth the same.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still too generous to himself, considering the inflation effect. I'm hoping he'll come back with a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation effect. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, you'll have to do better than that!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fine, we'll split it down the middle, but I'm not giving you any more than that! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to revert back to the original proposal, but with a smaller amount due to inflation.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain of $5000 is now worth only $1,632.77, which is a significant decrease. My gain of $8000 is still worth the same.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation effect, and I'm willing to end the game here."
