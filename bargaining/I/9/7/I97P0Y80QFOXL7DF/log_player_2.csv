"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90% and you can have the remaining 10%, but be warned, this is just the beginning, and the money will depreciate for me in every following round. So if you reject this, I will be pushing for a bigger share in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  The value depreciates for both of us, so dragging this out only hurts us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you're playing tough. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go lower than 40% for me.  Remember, every round that passes means I lose more value.  Let's end this before we both lose too much. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
