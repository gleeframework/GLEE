"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob, considering the slight advantage he has due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the greater inflation rate I face. This is still a good deal for you, as you'll get a larger portion than you would with a 3:1 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
