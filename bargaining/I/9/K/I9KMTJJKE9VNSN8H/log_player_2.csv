"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the amount equally considering the first round's inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, it's crucial to consider the inflation factor.  Even though I'm getting 400,000, the value of that money will be reduced by 5% in the next round. It's better to reject and see if I can get a better deal by proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I believe this offer is fair, considering the impact of inflation in the next round. I'm willing to share a larger portion of the money with you now to avoid further devaluation.""
}
