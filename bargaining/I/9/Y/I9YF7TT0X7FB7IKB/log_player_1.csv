Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split it 95/5, considering the inflation will make my share much smaller if we keep playing. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
