"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting with a high number, I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping to get a better deal than a 70:30 split. I'll try to negotiate further to get a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much yet.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not giving up too much. I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your numbers, let's meet in the middle now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle. I'll consider his proposal for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50:50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to split the money evenly."
