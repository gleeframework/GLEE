This is a tough situation, but rejecting this offer is too risky.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and Alice likely knows I'm getting desperate. If I reject this, there's a good chance she'll offer me even less next round, and I'll be forced to take a worse deal or risk getting nothing at all."
