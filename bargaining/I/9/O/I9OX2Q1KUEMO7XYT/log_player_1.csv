"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering Bob 60 dollars, which is 60% of the total amount. This way, I'll get 40 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, the money I gain is worth 36 dollars (40 dollars in the first round, but with 10% less value).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll get 30 dollars, which is worth 30 dollars in this round. It's a good offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let's try again!

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my thinking. In this round, the money I gain is worth 32.4 dollars (36 dollars in the previous round, but with 10% less value).

My new proposal is:

{""alice_gain"": 32, ""bob_gain"": 68}

I'm offering Bob 68 dollars, which is 68% of the total amount. This way, I'll get 32 dollars, which is 32% of the total amount."
