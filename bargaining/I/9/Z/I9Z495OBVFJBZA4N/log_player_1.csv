"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game going!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's work together to make this worthwhile for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll consider the actual values:

* Alice gain: $4,500
* Bob gain: $5,500

Considering the reduced value, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to think about my own gain. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
