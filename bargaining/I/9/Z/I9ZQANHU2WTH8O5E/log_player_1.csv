"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 75/25 is too extreme. This 60/40 split is a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
