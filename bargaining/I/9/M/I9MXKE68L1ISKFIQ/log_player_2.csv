Round 3

# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on the money's value.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. It's still a 52/48 split, but the reduced value means I'll get less than I would have in earlier rounds.
