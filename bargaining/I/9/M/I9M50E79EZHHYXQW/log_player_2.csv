Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value keeps decreasing. This is my final offer to secure a reasonable share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, this is as generous as I'll get 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gains. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, rejecting it risks an even worse outcome in the next round, where the money will be worth even less to Bob. It's better to secure something rather than risk getting a much lower amount or even nothing if the game continues."
