"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide what to do!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're being entirely fair with your first offer. I'll match your fairness now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a fair split, but I think I can do better. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offers. Now it's up to Bob to decide what to do!"
