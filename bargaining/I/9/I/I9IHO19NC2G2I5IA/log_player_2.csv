"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60

While Alice's offer is decent, it's worth considering the inflation rates. Bob only loses 5% per round, while Alice loses 20%.  It's in Bob's best interest to see if he can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a little more this time, but we can still split it fairly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While it would be nice to get a larger share, inflation is working against both of us, and the longer we wait, the less value the money will have. This offer is close enough to what I proposed in the previous round, and it's likely to be better than what I might get in the future."
