Alice's offer:

This is a terrible deal. While it's tempting to take something, it's better to see what Alice will offer next round. The inflation will decrease the value of the money Alice has, and it might make her more willing to give up a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is still a bad deal, my gains are worth 36% less than in the first round. It's better to take 10$ now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
