"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty lopsided split, Bob. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the pot. I'll propose a counteroffer: 420000 for me and 580000 for you.""
}
```

I'm trying to push back on the 70-30 split and propose a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""My previous offer still stands. Will you accept a 58-42 split?""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer, hoping Bob will accept it."
