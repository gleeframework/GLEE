I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly and avoid inflation. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

Since Bob was greedy in round 2, I'm going to reduce my offer.  I'll take 80% and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  Even though the amount of money is decreasing with every round, I still believe I can get a better deal. I am confident that I can get a higher share than 200,000 in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I'll offer Bob a slightly bigger share to encourage him to accept. 70% for me and 30% for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I will continue to reject Bob's offers.  The amount of money decreasing with each round is a significant concern, but I believe I can still get a better share than 300,000 in the remaining rounds.  I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, offering Bob 40% of the remaining money.  This is a significant share, but I need to secure an agreement before the inflation makes this a truly bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I still believe I can get a better deal.  The money is worth very little now, but I'm going to keep pushing for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're down to the wire here, and the value of the money is dwindling rapidly.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will finally accept and we can both walk away with something.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal at this point, but I'm willing to compromise."
