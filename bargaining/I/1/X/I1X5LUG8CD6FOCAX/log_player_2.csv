"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob! I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  While it's a ""fair"" split in terms of a simple percentage, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  I know the money is worth less to me each round, so I need to be strategic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the risk of the money losing value with each round.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split the money 50/50 this round. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is getting to me, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might end up with nothing at all.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise."
