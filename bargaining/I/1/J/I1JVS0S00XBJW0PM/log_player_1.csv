"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, my gain of 50$ is actually 40$ in real value. Since Bob's gain of 50$ is worth the same as in the first round, it's 20$ in real value.

I accept this offer.
