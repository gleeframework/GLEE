Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Inflation is affecting us both, and an even split is the fairest outcome at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's painful to accept an even split at this point, but the inflation is killing me.  It's clear Alice won't go any higher, and it's only going to get worse for me if I keep holding out."
