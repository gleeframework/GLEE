Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, let's compromise. 65/35 seems like a fair split, given the inflation. I'm willing to give you more, but I'm not letting you take the majority.   
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice, and our money is vanishing.  I'm offering 55/45.  It's better than your last offer even considering the inflation, and gives you a decent share. Let's be reasonable and close this deal!""}
