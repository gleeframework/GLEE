"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55-45 split. The money is losing value fast!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is depreciating quickly, Bob.  Let's split it evenly this time, 50/50. It's the fairest way to avoid losing too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the money is losing value rapidly, especially for me, accepting the 50/50 split now seems like the best option to minimize further loss."
