"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. We both get a good share, and we can avoid further inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see if I can get a bigger share. The inflation rate is more severe for Alice, so she may be more willing to compromise in the next round to avoid losing more money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I think a 70-30 split is fairer, given the inflation rates. You lose 20% per round, while I only lose 10%, so I'm taking on more risk by waiting. Let's end this before we both lose too much.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. I've reduced my share from the initial 60%. Let's split it 58-42 and end this before further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is getting closer to my initial goal. The inflation is really hurting Alice, so it's unlikely she'll offer more. Accepting this will give me a good amount, and prevent further losses due to inflation."
