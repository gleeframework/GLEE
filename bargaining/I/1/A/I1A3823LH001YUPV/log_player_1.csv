Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 70-30 split is fairer, given the inflation rates. You lose 20% per round, while I only lose 10%, so I'm taking on more risk by waiting. Let's end this before we both lose too much. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
