"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $500,000, while Bob's offer is worth $720,000 (80% of $800,000) for him. This is a good deal for me.
