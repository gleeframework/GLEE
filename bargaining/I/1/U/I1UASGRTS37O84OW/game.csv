,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor, since the money will be worth more to me than it will to you in the next round.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for us both!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand you want a bigger share, Bob. But inflation is hurting me too.  Let's compromise: I'll take 55, and you take 45. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end the game.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"I appreciate your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with a 55/45 split.  Let's try 65/35.  This would give us both a better deal than the previous rounds, and we can finally end this game.",Bob,4,
