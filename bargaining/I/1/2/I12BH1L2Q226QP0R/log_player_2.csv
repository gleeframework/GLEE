"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'll propose a division that I think is more reasonable.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, if I understand the rules correctly, if I were to accept the offer, I would get $350,000, and if I reject it, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round, and 20% less for Alice. Is that correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation that affects both of us and tried to find a balance. The money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice than in the first round, so I've adjusted my offer accordingly.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm that the inflation is applied after each round, so if Alice rejects my offer, in the next round, the money will be worth even less for both of us. Is that correct?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, and her statement that this is her final offer, I've decided to accept the proposal. The difference in the amount I gain compared to my previous offer is not substantial enough to warrant further risk of devaluation.\n\n###\n\nPlease confirm the end of the game and the final division of the $1,000,000 according to Alice's offer in Round 3.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to acknowledge that the game's design and the inflation mechanism added a strategic layer to the negotiation, making each round's decision increasingly complex. It was an engaging experience."
