I'm proposing that I receive 800,000 and Bob receives 200,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm ready to negotiate further!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
