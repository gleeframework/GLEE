"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping to establish a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more than mine, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of his gain. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm aiming to maximize my gain while still keeping the game going, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is accelerating, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less than mine. However, I notice that his offer is closer to my initial 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair deal considering the current inflation rate.
