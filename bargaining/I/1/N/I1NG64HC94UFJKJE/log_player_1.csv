"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to establish a fair foundation for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 5% less, so I'd get $4,000 instead of $4,000. However, considering the offer is still slightly skewed towards Bob, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to adjust the ratio. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not willing to give up more than this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 14.26% less, so I'd get $3,450. Considering the offer is still slightly skewed towards Bob, I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and trying to adjust the ratio. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to ensure I get a decent amount considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and protecting my own interests, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation, so I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 22.62% less, so I'd get $2,340. Considering the offer is still skewed towards Bob, I'll reject it.
