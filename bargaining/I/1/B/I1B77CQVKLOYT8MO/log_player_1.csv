"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can move forward with the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a bigger share for himself.

Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $300,000 (which is 30% of the original $1,000,000)
* Bob gain: $700,000 (which is 70% of the original $1,000,000)

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 70% of the original amount, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less than the second round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $550,000, which is a 55% share of the original $1,000,000. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share for myself and giving Bob a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the 27.1% decrease in value, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $400,000 (which is 40% of the original $1,000,000, but 27.1% less than my initial gain in round 1)
* Bob gain: $600,000 (which is 60% of the original $1,000,000)

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than 40% of the original amount, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better.
