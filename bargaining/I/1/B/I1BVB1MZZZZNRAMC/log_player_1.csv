I'm taking a very greedy approach in the first round. I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it to avoid getting nothing if the rounds keep going and the money depreciates.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is fair, and I'm sure the inflation will only hurt me further if I reject. It's better to take the 500,000 now while it's still worth something."
