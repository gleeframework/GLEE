I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see if he takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's a lot of money, I'm confident that I can get a better deal.  I'm not afraid to wait and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer.  He wants a 60/40 split, so I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since inflation is working against me, I need to get a good deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really hitting hard now. It's time to cut my losses and take this offer. I'm still getting a decent amount of money, and it's better than risking getting nothing if I keep rejecting."
