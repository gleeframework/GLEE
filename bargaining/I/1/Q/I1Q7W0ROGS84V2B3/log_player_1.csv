Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a strong opening offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it rather than risking losing value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is not even close to fair, considering the inflation.  It's a huge loss from the previous round and I'll bet on myself to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to stick to a strong split, but with a slightly lower starting point to account for inflation.  I believe Bob will recognize the value in taking this offer, as if he rejects it, the value of the money will drop again in the next round, and we both stand to lose more."
