"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still offer Bob a decent amount to make the deal appealing. Now it's Bob's turn!"
