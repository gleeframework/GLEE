"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm also leaving room for negotiation and inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, I'll reject it. I was hoping for a compromise, but this offer doesn't change the terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation has already taken a toll on the value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to protect my end""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think 55 is a better split for me 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I think I can do better than that. Considering the inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of the money, I'll try to push for a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the significant inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was to meet me in the middle. I'll try to push for a slightly better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I'm not getting any less""
}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation and the fact that Bob was trying to meet me in the middle."
