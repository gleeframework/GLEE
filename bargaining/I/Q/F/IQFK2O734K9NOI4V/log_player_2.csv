"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable split. I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  It's a good deal considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's worth pushing for a better deal. Even though Alice is taking more, we're early in the game and the inflation rate is significant.  Let's see if we can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a good deal considering the inflation rate and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer wasn't great considering the inflation. I need to get a decent share while it's still worth something. I propose $5,600 for me and $4,400 for you. It's a compromise, and we need to agree soon. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still better than the 50/50 split I initially proposed, and the inflation is making it increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers. It's time to secure a deal before the value of the money drops further."
