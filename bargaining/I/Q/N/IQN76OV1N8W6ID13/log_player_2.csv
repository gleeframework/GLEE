"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Meanwhile, Alice has an incentive to negotiate since the money loses value for her with each passing round. Let's see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I'll make an offer that slightly favors me more than the previous one, but still seems reasonable for Alice, considering the devaluation she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Considering the value loss you're facing, this seems like a fairer deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the inflation pinch. Let's settle this fairly now. 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Since the money's value remains the same for me but decreases for Alice, I'm in a stronger negotiating position with each passing round. Alice's offer is slightly better than the first one, but I believe she can be persuaded to offer more as the rounds continue and the value of her potential gain decreases further. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the continued devaluation of the money for Alice and the fact that I'm not losing any value, I'll make an offer that slightly increases my share again, while still being mindful that Alice needs to feel she's getting a somewhat fair deal to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 512500,
""alice_gain"": 487500,
""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I believe this adjustment is reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. I'm willing to accept this to end the game now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, considering the money's value has not decreased for me but has significantly decreased for Alice, I'm in a strong position to negotiate for more. Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, and each round decreases the value of her potential gain further. I'll wait to see if she's willing to offer me a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the substantial decrease in value for Alice and the fact that I've maintained the full value of my potential gain, I'll make an offer that reflects my strong negotiating position. However, I still need to ensure that Alice finds the offer somewhat acceptable to end the game.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe this is a generous offer at this point.""}"
