Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer still gives you a significant amount, and it's better than we'll both get if we wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Waiting any longer means a smaller reward for both of us.
* **Alice's Offer:** Her offer is still better than the initial split she proposed. Accepting ensures I receive a reasonable amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a potentially better offer in Round 4 is too risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and the value will further decrease.

It's better to secure a decent amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later.
