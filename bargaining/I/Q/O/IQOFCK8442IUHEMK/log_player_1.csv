"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering Bob 60 dollars, which is a relatively generous split, considering we're just starting out. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm not thrilled with the offer. However, I'll try to make the most of it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to make a better deal in the next round.
