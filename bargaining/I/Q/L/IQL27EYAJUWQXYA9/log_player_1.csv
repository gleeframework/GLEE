"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount to consider accepting, but still leaves me with the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While the initial offer was fair, it's clear Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'll hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'll propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less now, it's more important to secure a reasonable share. I hope Bob will see that this offer is more balanced than his last one, and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to really hurt. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. I reject this offer and will counter with a more equitable one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a compromise, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. This should show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want a fair share."
