Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but her offer is getting worse with each round. The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I'm still willing to gamble that I can get a better deal.  I need to increase the pressure and signal I'm willing to risk it all for a fair share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, stop this charade. You know this is going nowhere. I'm offering a fair deal. Take it or leave it; I'm done playing games.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  I'm mirroring Alice's language to create a sense of urgency and finality. 
* **Strategic Retreat (Slightly):** I'm slightly lowering my demand from 550,000 to 400,000. This might seem counterintuitive, but it makes my offer appear like a significant concession after two rejections. 
* **Strong Language:** Using phrases like ""charade"" and ""playing games"" is designed to unsettle Alice and potentially make her question her strategy."
