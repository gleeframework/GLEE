Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's split it and be done 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal significantly worse than a 50/50 split is not in my best interest. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the risk of getting nothing increases for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Okay, how about this?  We both know I'm losing value each round.  Let's be realistic and close this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I want a 50/50 split, I need to offer something slightly better to Alice to entice her. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. This offer is a compromise, aiming to end the game sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this before it's worthless 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer is far from ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds. Alice is playing hardball, but I need to cut my losses at this point."
