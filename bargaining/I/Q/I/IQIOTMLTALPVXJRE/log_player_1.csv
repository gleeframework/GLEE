"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This way, we both get a decent share and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

I'm taking a more aggressive approach and proposing a 50/50 split. This way, I'm not leaving much room for Bob to negotiate further, and we can finally settle on a division."
