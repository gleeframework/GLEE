"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the game's inflation dynamics. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation advantage I have in this round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me! However, I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split is fair, especially considering the inflation advantage I have in this round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking forward to making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my proposal will be adjusted accordingly. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Time to make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, taking into account the inflation dynamics and trying to squeeze a better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
