"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, a 50-50 split is actually a better deal for me than it was in the first round. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
