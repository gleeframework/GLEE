"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm also being smart. I'm sure we can both make a lot of money in the long run if we work together. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's best to see if she's willing to be more fair. There are 12 rounds, and the money will decrease in value, so it's important to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. We both have a lot to lose if we don't come to an agreement.  A 50/50 split is the most logical way to ensure both of us get a good share.""}
