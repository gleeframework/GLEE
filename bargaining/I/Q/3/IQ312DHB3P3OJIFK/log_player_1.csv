"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both have a lot to lose if we don't come to an agreement.  A 50/50 split is the most logical way to ensure both of us get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
