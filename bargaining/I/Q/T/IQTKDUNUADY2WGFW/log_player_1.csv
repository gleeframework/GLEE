"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 95$ for myself and giving Bob 5$. This is a fairly aggressive proposal, but I want to see how Bob reacts and if he is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting Bob's offer in round 2 is the best course of action. Due to inflation, my gain is worth less than it was in the previous round. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures I get a decent amount, and any further negotiation might lead to a smaller share in the next round."
