"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll compare the offers as follows:

My gain in round 1: $600,000
Bob's gain in round 1: $400,000

My gain in round 2: $600,000 (no change)
Bob's gain in round 2: $550,000 * 0.95 = $522,500

I'll accept this offer.
