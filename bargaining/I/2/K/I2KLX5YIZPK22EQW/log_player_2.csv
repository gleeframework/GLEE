Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. While $1000 is something, it's a very small portion of the total, and I'm confident I can do better in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose an even split. This is fair and maximizes our potential gains, as we both receive the same amount."
