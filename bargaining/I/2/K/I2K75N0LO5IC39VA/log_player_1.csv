Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal, as I want to see how Bob reacts and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is fair and I'd rather not risk further inflation."
