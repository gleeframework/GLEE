"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our shares.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob, but the clock is ticking.  Take this while it's still a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept getting a smaller share than in the last round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's a fair deal considering the lost value for you. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 325000 
# Alice gain: 675000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
At this point, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue. The value of my share is dropping rapidly due to inflation. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the possibility of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
