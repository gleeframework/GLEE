Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept getting a smaller share than in the last round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about meeting in the middle, the inflation heavily favors me. He's feeling the pressure, and I can leverage that.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 675000,
""bob_gain"": 325000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's a fair deal considering the lost value for you. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing Bob close to his last offer while still giving myself a significant advantage.  By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add pressure and make him seriously consider the deal. He's likely feeling the heat of inflation, and this offer, while not as good as previous rounds for him, is still better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
