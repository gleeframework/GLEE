"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. It's still a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4000 I would gain in this round is equivalent to $3200 in the first round. Not a bad offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is my bottom line.""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is my new bottom line. I need to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! In this round, the $3000 I would gain is equivalent to $1660 in the first round, which is a significant reduction. Considering Bob's message, I'm not sure if he's willing to go any higher, and I need to think about whether I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 61.44% less than in the first round. I need to be careful with my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is my last offer. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a bad deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
