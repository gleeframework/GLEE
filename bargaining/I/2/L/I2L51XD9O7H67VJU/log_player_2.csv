# Alice's message: I'm still trying to find a fair compromise. Let's try this. 
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is making concessions, the deal is still getting worse for me with each round due to the inflation.  I need to hold firm to signal I need a significantly better offer to account for this."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the inflation is hurting my end of the deal significantly.  I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This is my best offer.""}

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go any lower than this. Let's end this before we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is really starting to bite now, and Alice's offer is now reasonably close to my last offer.  While I could push my luck further, there's a real risk we'll both end up with nothing if we don't agree soon."
