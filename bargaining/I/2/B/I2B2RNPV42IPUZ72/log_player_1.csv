"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking $900,000 and giving Bob $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a large share but leaves Bob with something as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still losing a significant amount. I'll reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'll try to find a middle ground. I'm lowering my proposed share by $100,000, but still offering Bob a significant amount.  This should incentivize him to accept, as he will get a bigger share than he did in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal, even taking inflation into account. I'm still losing a lot of money, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my proposed share, but I'm still offering Bob a reasonable amount. This is a compromise considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, but I believe it's fair and could lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal, but it's still not good enough for me. I need to get at least 600,000 to make this worthwhile, considering the inflation. I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share to $600,000, which is significantly lower than my initial proposal. However, considering the inflation, it's the lowest I can go while still making a profit. I believe this offer is fair and leaves Bob with a considerable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still below my initial target, it's getting close.  Considering the significant inflation and the possibility of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement, I'm willing to accept this offer."
