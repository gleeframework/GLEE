Let's see if Bob wants to take a small share to end the game quickly.  I'm hoping he doesn't realize the inflation affects me, not him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I'm getting less due to inflation, it's still better than getting nothing if we go another round.  I'll take the 5000."
