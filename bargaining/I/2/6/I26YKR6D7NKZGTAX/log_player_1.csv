"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This is a fair offer, considering I am making the first offer and the risk of inflation is present.  It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm offering $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm slightly lowering my own take to encourage acceptance. I still think this is a fair offer given the inflation that's affecting the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. Even though the value of my share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'm still willing to compromise to reach an agreement before the time runs out."

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, I'm still clinging to the hope that I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm not ready to give in just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. This is a significant compromise given the inflation rate, but I need to reach an agreement soon to secure something for myself."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the value of my share has been drastically reduced due to inflation, I'm accepting this offer.  I'm at risk of getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers.  It's time to secure some money, even if it's significantly less than I initially hoped for."
