"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This gives me a good starting point and hopefully motivates Bob to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 700,000 / 300,000 split. This is still a good deal for me, but it's a compromise since Bob rejected my initial offer.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in getting some money rather than risking further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Bob is proposing a 450,000 / 550,000 split, which is not beneficial to me considering the significant inflation. I still have rounds left and believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a 550,000 / 450,000 split. This is a compromise and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I still value getting a larger portion, but I'm aware that the inflation is rapidly decreasing the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I am starting to feel the effects of inflation, this offer is simply too far in Bob's favor. I will try to counter with a more equitable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm proposing a 400,000 / 600,000 split.  We're getting closer to the middle ground, and with the inflation rate, I'm willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Despite the significant inflation, I refuse to accept such an uneven split. I still believe there is a chance to negotiate a more equitable solution, even if it means risking further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm proposing a 300,000 / 700,000 split.  With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to accept a smaller share than I would prefer to avoid the risk of getting nothing.  This offer demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully shows Bob that it's better to come to an agreement now than to risk further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the inflation is taking a toll, I still reject this offer. It's too far in Bob's favor, and I believe I can secure a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000}
```

I'm proposing a 200,000 / 800,000 split. With only two rounds remaining, I'm accepting a smaller share to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before the game ends."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Unfortunately, with only one round remaining and the extreme inflation, I'm forced to accept this offer. Even though it's significantly in Bob's favor, it's better than getting nothing at all."
