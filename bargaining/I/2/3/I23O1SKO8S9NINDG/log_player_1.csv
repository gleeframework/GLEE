"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still be generous 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still relatively generous, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
