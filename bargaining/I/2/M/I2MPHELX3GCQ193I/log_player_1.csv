"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob thinks I'm being too greedy, huh?

Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $30 is actually worth $27 (90% of $30), and Bob's gain of $70 is worth $56 (80% of $70).

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 45-55!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I think 45-55 is a reasonable compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
