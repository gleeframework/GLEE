750000.0,250000.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I take 750000 and Bob takes 250000. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money with each round.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a more balanced split that considers the value of money decreasing faster for me. Let's end this quickly and avoid further devaluation.,Bob,2,
