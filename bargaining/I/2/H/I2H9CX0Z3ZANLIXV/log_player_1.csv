"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. This offer is more fair, and it's time for you to be generous. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

I'm not going to fall for it, though. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, hoping this compromise will be more appealing to him."
