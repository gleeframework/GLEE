"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering you $3,000, and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $7,000 is now worth $6,300 (10% less), and Bob's $3,000 is now worth $2,400 (20% less).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since my previous $7,000 is now worth $6,300, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My previous $7,000 is now worth $5,050 (27.1% less), and Bob's $3,000 is now worth $1,550 (48.8% less).

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since his offer is relatively close to the original $3,000, and my gain is relatively close to the original $7,000, I'll accept this offer.
