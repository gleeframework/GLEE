I'm going for a fairly aggressive opening offer. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, but still leave some room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I need to consider the inflation. My initial offer was too aggressive, and Bob is clearly willing to stand his ground. Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option at this point. It ensures I get something, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
