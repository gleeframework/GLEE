Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a higher share. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

Considering the money is worth even less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor, I'll reject it and make another counter-proposal.
