Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give you a bit more to avoid further rounds of negotiation and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  Each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a smaller portion later.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's offer of $400,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $100,000. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting now locks in a decent amount."
