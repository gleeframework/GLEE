I'm starting with a fair 50/50 split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even with the 20% inflation, I'm worth more than $40. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to try and increase my share slightly.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as we're getting closer to the end and the value of the money will keep decreasing."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Even with the significant inflation, I'm worth more than $45, and I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, hoping to convince Bob that it's better to accept now than to risk getting nothing at all.  Inflation is hitting hard, and the value of the money is getting lower with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. I know the inflation is hurting me, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but I won't give in yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm going to take a gamble and raise my offer again.  I'm hoping Bob will see that the inflation is really starting to affect the value of the money, and that accepting this offer is the best way to get something out of this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is taking a huge toll. I'm not happy about getting only $38, but it's better than nothing. I'll take the offer and hope to learn from this experience."
