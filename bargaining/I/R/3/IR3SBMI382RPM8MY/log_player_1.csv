Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly uneven split. I want to get as much as possible while still giving Bob something, hoping he'll accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less to me now, it's still a better deal than if we continue and I have to offer him a larger share."
