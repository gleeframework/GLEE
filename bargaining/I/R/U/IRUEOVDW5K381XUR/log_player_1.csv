Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share early on, or if he'll be more demanding as the rounds progress.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option for me. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is worth less now, and I'm already losing 5% of its value.  
* **Fair Split:**  This is a relatively fair split, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better offer in the next round.
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer risks a less favorable deal in the next round.  

It's important to be pragmatic and secure a decent share before inflation eats away at the potential gains."
