"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving Bob a relatively small portion to start with. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less after inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is too skewed towards you, considering the inflation. I'll try to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more, considering the initial offer was 20% for you.""
}
```"
