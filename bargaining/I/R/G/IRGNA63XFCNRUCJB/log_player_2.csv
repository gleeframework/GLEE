"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a better split, with me getting the larger share this time. It's only fair, since you got the better deal in the previous round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing money with each round due to inflation. 55/45 is my compromise, and it's a better deal for you than what you'll get if we keep stalling. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
