Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40, still giving you a majority, but closer to an even split. This way we can both avoid the risk of losing more with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
