Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, that seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWe are in round 2, and Bob is already feeling the effects of inflation. His offer of an even split, 50/50, may seem fair at first glance, but considering the money is worth 10% less to him than in the first round, it actually gives him a slightly better deal than me. Moreover, since the money's value doesn't decrease for me, I have the advantage of time. I can afford to wait and see if I can get a better offer in the next rounds. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially leveraging Bob's increasing urgency due to inflation to get a more favorable split. Therefore, I choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob a slightly better deal than in the first round, but still not as good as the even split he proposed in round 2. Given that the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each round, I'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money for him. My offer of 58 for myself and 42 for Bob reflects this consideration. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency, implying that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, he might end up with less in future rounds due to the effects of inflation. By framing this offer as ""more than fair,"" I'm attempting to persuade Bob that he's getting a reasonable deal and should accept it before the value of the money decreases further for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not giving up much more. Let's try to make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this round, Bob has offered me 45, which is less than the 50 he offered in round 2, and significantly less than the 58 I offered myself in round 3. Given that the money's value hasn't decreased for me, I see no reason to accept a worse offer than I've previously rejected. Moreover, Bob's message suggests he's trying to negotiate, but the actual numbers don't reflect a genuine attempt at compromise, especially considering the effects of inflation on his gain. With the money being worth 27.1% less to Bob than in the first round, his offer of 55 for himself is more valuable than it initially seems. I believe I can still get a better deal, so I choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, be wise""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than in round 3, but still not as good as the even split he proposed in round 2. Given that the money is now worth 27.1% less to Bob than in the first round, I believe he should be more willing to accept a deal that gives him a smaller share. By mentioning inflation in my message, I'm trying to remind Bob that time is not on his side and that he should be eager to make a deal before the value of the money decreases further. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency, implying that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, he might end up with even less in future rounds. By offering 57 for myself and 43 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and giving Bob enough to make him willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's make a deal before inflation eats away more of our money. I'm willing to give you 40, but I can't go lower. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob has offered me 40, which is less than the 45 he offered in round 4, and significantly less than the 50 he offered in round 2.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly worse deal than in round 5, taking into account the increasing effects of inflation on his gain. With the money being worth 40.95% less to Bob than in the first round, I believe he should be more desperate to make a deal. By offering 59 for myself and 41 for Bob, I'm attempting to take advantage of Bob's worsening situation while still giving him enough to make him consider accepting. My message is brief and to the point, emphasizing that time is running out and that Bob should accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further.### {""alice_gain"": 59, ""bob_gain"": 41, ""message"": ""Time is running out, be reasonable""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to have to make a bigger move. This is my final offer. If you reject it, we both get nothing.  Let's be smart and make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob has made a desperate attempt to make a deal, offering me 35, which is even less than the 40 he offered in round 6. Given that the money's value hasn't decreased for me, I see no reason to accept a worse offer than I've previously rejected. Moreover, Bob's message suggests he's trying to create a sense of urgency, but the actual numbers don't reflect a genuine attempt at compromise, especially considering the effects of inflation on his gain. With the money being worth 52.17% less to Bob than in the first round, his offer of 65 for himself is more valuable than it initially seems. However, Bob's threat of ""this is my final offer"" is not credible, as he has no way of enforcing it. I believe I can still get a better deal, so I choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 9

With the money being worth 52.17% less to Bob than in the first round, I believe he should be even more desperate to make a deal. By offering 61 for myself and 39 for Bob, I'm attempting to take advantage of Bob's worsening situation while still giving him enough to make him consider accepting. My message is brief and to the point, emphasizing that Bob's options are running out and that he should accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further.
