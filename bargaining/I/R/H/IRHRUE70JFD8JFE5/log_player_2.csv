Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this back and forth isn't helping. I'm willing to come down slightly to 57/43.  It acknowledges your initial proposal while reflecting the impact of inflation on my end. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's getting risky to keep rejecting. Even though I'd prefer a 55/45 split, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
