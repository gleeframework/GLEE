{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my new offer:

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a big toll on my potential gain! With the money worth significantly less, I need to be more realistic. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm not sure I can do better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since Bob's last offer was 70/30, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my new offer:
