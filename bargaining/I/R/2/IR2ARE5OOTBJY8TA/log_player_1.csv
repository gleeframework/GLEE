"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, and hopefully Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept it.  There's a lot of rounds left, and I'm not willing to give away more than 10% just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing everything by continuing to play.  While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
