"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get a larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer considering I'm trying to set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to give Bob an even larger share, so I'll have to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
