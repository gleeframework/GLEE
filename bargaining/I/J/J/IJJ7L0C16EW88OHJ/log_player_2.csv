Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation, I think a 57-43 split is more reasonable. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but here's why accepting is the better choice for Bob at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. Waiting longer means getting even less in the end.
* **Alice's Offer Improved:**  Alice's offer is closer to the middle ground now. While not ideal, it's better than her initial 60-40 proposal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting carries the risk that Alice's offer in the next round will be even worse, and the value will have decreased further. 

Accepting the 57-43 split now guarantees Bob something reasonable before inflation eats away more of the potential gains."
