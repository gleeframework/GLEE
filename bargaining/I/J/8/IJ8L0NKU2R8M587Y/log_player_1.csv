"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is to see if Bob is open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Will you take 80-20? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not sure if I want to accept an even smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value in the money.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
