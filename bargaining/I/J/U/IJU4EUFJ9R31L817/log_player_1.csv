"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous just yet. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since my gains are worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm not getting as much value out of the deal as I would have in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit stingy, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob! I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think we can do better than 60/40.""}

Let's see if Bob will take the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With my money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I'm not willing to give up too much yet.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that he'll be willing to make further concessions in future rounds. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
