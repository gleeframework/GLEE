Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This back and forth isn't helping anyone. 50/50 is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is getting desperate and the deal will only get worse for her as time goes on. Accepting 50/50 now guarantees a decent payout before inflation eats away at her share even more.
