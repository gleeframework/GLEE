"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a very aggressive opening move, aiming to quickly secure a large portion of the money.  Let's see if Bob accepts this lopsided offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair and equal split. I accept Bob's offer."
