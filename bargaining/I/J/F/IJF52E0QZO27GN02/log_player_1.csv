"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you.  This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to think about the value of the money more carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round.
