"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, Alice.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less after the first round, the actual values are:

* Alice's gain: $8,000 * 0.95 = $7,600
* Bob's gain: $2,000 (no change)

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll calculate the actual values:

* Alice's gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750
* Bob's gain: $5,000

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since I was hoping for a bit more. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take 40% and let's move forward.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
