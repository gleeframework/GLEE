"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount!""
}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the money, which is a fair share, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is fair.  Let's both get a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to be more generous this time. However, I'm not convinced that 40% is a fair share for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the money evenly. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be more appealing to Bob."
