"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll aim to get a good chunk of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent amount.

Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
I'll take $700,000 and leave Bob with $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, my $700,000 is now worth $630,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll take the $500,000 he's offering, which is worth $450,000 after inflation. It's a decent offer, but I'd like to try to get more.

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so $1,000,000 is now worth $900,000.

I'll aim to get a bit more in this round. Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money after 4 rounds of inflation:

Original $1,000,000 → 90% = $900,000 (Round 2)
$900,000 → 90% = $810,000 (Round 3)
$810,000 → 90% = $729,000 (Round 4)

So, the money is now worth $729,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll take the $550,000 he's offering, which is worth $550,000 after inflation. It's a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
