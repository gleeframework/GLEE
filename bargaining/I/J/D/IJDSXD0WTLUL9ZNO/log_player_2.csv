"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you a fair share, Bob.  We can work out a better deal later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's risky to accept such an uneven split so early on. Even though the inflation is higher for Bob, it makes sense to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable. I'm offering you 40% and taking 60%. We both can get a better deal with this than with your previous offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split the difference from last round. This is a fair offer that gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While a 55/45 split is still in Alice's favor, the inflation is hurting me more than it is her.  Taking the offer is the safer choice at this point."
