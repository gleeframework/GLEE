Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous by not lowering my offer further 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept the offer at this point. The inflation is eating away at the value of the money Bob gains, and the offer is not likely to improve further. It's more advantageous to take what is available and end the game."
