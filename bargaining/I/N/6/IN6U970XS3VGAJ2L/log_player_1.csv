"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make it worth his while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial offer was actually quite generous. Now, Bob's offer is quite attractive. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
