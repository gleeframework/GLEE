Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer.  Even though it's a small gain, it's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 
Let's split it evenly. I don't want to take too much risk, and a 50/50 split seems fair."
