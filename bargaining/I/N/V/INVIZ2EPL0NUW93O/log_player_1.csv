I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since we're both starting out, I think it's important to make a clear statement of my desire for the majority of the money.  I'm also anticipating Bob might be a little greedy and try to get a larger share, but I think a good starting point is to set the terms for the negotiation."
