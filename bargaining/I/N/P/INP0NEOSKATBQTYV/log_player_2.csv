"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the total amount is now $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8).

I'll make a counter-offer to Alice. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80% = 64%), the actual amount being proposed is:

# Bob gain: 4000 * 0.64 = 2560
# Alice gain: 6000 * 0.64 = 3840

I'll accept Alice's offer this time.
