Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  We can keep going, but the money will keep shrinking for me.  This is the best deal you'll get.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said the last offer was your final one, but I'm willing to take the risk. This is my new proposal. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, the inflation makes it less appealing to keep rejecting. It's better to accept and secure at least something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
