"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem like a lot, but remember, the value of money decreases with each round due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair and simple solution, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
