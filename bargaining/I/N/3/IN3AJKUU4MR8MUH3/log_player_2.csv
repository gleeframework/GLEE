Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases for you with each round. I'm offering a 51/49 split. It's better than what you'll get if you keep stalling. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51
