"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. It's still a good compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of 80% of the original, which is 64% of the original. Bob's gain is still 20% of the original.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's an improvement over the first one. I'll accept it for now.
