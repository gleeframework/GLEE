"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 20% less, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is still a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money Bob gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his offer seems more reasonable now. I'll consider it.
