"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, with me getting the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose a 50-50 split to ensure fairness for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth 90% of 500,000, which is 450,000.

I'm not sure if I want to settle for a 50-50 split, considering I could potentially negotiate for more. I'll reject this offer and propose my next one.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of 450,000, which is 405,000. I'll propose a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.
