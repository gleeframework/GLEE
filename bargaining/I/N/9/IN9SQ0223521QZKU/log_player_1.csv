"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to match my fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, as it seems like a fair and reasonable compromise given the reduced value of the money."
