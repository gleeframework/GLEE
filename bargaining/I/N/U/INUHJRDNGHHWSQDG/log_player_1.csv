I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping to get Bob to accept.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Bob's offer is very unfair, giving him most of the money. While I'm losing value each round, I'm still better off rejecting and proposing my own offer in the next round. There's still a chance to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain this round, but still trying to get a good portion of the money.  This offer should be more appealing to Bob, especially since he rejected my previous proposal."
