Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Let's get this done before the money starts shrinking too much. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting worse for me, and the time pressure is on him more than me. I'll wait for a better deal."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money evenly.  We both get a decent amount, and we avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob is finally moving towards a more even split, he's still getting the larger share. Given the faster rate of devaluation on his end, I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get a larger share, but I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split.  We're both losing value with each passing round.  Let's try a 55/45 split. This is my final offer before I see how much more I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is feeling the pressure now, offering his ""final"" compromise.  While it's getting closer to a fair split, I think his need to avoid losing even more value will push him further in my favor.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're in a stalemate.  The money is shrinking, and neither of us is budging.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer.  We both get something, and we avoid the risk of losing everything.  Let's do this. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough one, as it's the same offer I originally proposed. However, with the accelerating depreciation, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for more. Accepting guarantees me a reasonable sum, whereas continued refusal could leave us both with nothing."
