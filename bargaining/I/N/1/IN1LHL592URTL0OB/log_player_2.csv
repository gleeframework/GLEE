"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  This seems fair considering the money loses value over time, and it will benefit us both to settle quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's split the difference a little more this time and get this money while it's still worth something.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is dropping fast, especially for you. I'm offering you $45 which is still a good chunk, and I'll take $55. This makes sense for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
