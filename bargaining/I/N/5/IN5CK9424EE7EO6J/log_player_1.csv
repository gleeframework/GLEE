I propose a 900,000 for me, 100,000 for Bob. I'm being generous in the first round, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation, but still offering a significant portion. I'm hoping that Bob will realize the value in ending the game now, as the further we go, the less the money will be worth for both of us."
