Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the decreasing value of money. It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
