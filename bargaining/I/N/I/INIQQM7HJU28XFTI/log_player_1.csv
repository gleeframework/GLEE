"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I'll get a decent chunk of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with a reasonable amount to keep him interested in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a significant increase in his share, but I still think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave Bob with a substantial amount."
