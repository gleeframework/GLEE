"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm leaving you a decent chunk.  Accept, and we'll both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather try my luck in the next round, hoping the decreased value of money might make Alice more willing to compromise or make a mistake in her proposal. Plus, 100,000 seems like a relatively small portion considering we're dividing 1,000,000 dollars. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to see if I can get a better deal, despite the inflation risk."
