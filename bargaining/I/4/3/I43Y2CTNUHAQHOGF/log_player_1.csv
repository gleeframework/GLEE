Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's my turn now!

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split seems fair at this point, and I don't want to risk losing more value to inflation."
