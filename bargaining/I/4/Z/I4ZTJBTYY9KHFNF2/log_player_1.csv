I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. This gives Bob a small share but ensures I get the majority. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I am getting 200,000, it's significantly less than my initial offer. Additionally, Bob's offer is very favorable to him, and I don't believe it's a fair split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 600,000 - 400,000 split.  While I'm taking a bigger cut than Bob's previous offer, it's a more balanced split considering the inflation factor."
