"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll take the smaller share to show good faith""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. My message is to show that I'm willing to compromise and take the smaller share to make the negotiation easier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this time, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 10% less than my original offer, which is $4,000 * 0.9 = $3,600.

I'll decide to reject this offer, since it's not as favorable as my original offer, considering the inflation.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time, let's finalize the deal""
}
```

My gain of $3,000 is worth 10% less than the $4,000 I offered in round 2, and the $7,000 Bob would get is worth 5% less than the $6,000 he offered. I'm trying to make a more balanced offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4,500 is worth 27.1% less than my original offer of $8,000, which is $8,000 * 0.721 = $5,768. My gain is actually a bit less than what Bob is offering.

Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 14.26% less than his original offer of $6,000, which is $6,000 * 0.855 = $5,130. His gain is actually more than what he's offering.

I'll decide to reject this offer, since it's not as favorable as my original offer, considering the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a very small share, but I need to get something""
}
```

My gain of $2,500 is worth 68.75% of my original offer of $3,600 (from round 2), considering the cumulative inflation. I'm taking a very small share, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you take advantage of me, I'm taking the larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $5,500 is worth 40.95% less than my original offer of $8,000, which is $8,000 * 0.591 = $4,728. My gain is actually more than what Bob is offering.

However, considering the previous offers and the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer from Bob. I'll decide to accept this offer.
