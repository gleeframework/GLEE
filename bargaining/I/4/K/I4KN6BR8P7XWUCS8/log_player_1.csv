"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%. The message is a friendly suggestion to split the money fairly. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a bit fairer, considering we both lose value over time. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the new offer, I'd like to accept Bob's proposal. The 45-55 split seems reasonable, and I'd rather settle with a smaller gain now than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds.
