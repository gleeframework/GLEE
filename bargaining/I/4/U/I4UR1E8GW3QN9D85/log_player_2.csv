"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 100k and let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially when I know there's a chance to get more!  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's split this fairly, Alice.  I'm offering you 400k, which is more than your last offer. We can both walk away happy with this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40.  This is a fair deal considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it!  It's a fair deal considering inflation, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Alice.  Let's call it a day."
