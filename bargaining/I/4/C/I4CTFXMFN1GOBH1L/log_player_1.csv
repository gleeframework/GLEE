"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. Since I'm making the first offer, I want to start with a slightly higher amount for myself, but still be relatively fair. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less due to inflation, the split is now 48-52 in Bob's favor, which is less favorable to me than my initial offer. I'd like to make another proposal to try to get a better deal.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. The message ""Meet in the middle"" conveys my willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution. Considering the inflation, this offer is actually slightly more favorable to Bob than it appears, as the money is worth less to me than it was in the initial round.\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
