"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 15 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to accept to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation.
