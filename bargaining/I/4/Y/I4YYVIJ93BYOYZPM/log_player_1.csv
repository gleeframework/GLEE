"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 and Bob receives $40, with the message ""Let's be reasonable"" to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but that was a bit lopsided. This offer is fair given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer, as I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The inflation affects me more than Bob, so I need to be careful with my decision. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. Given the inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decrease in value for both of us. My message to Bob is an attempt to convey a sense of compromise and fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting the 50/50 split is the best decision. The value of the money has decreased substantially for me, and further negotiations may lead to an even less favorable outcome. Bob's offer seems fair at this point, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid losing more value in the next rounds."
