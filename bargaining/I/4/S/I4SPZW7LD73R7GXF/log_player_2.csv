Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand the inflation is a factor, but I'm still not comfortable with such a lopsided split.  This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the inflation but also tries to be fair to both of us. Let's find a solution we can both agree on.

# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still not fully acknowledging the impact of inflation. While her offer is better than her first, she's essentially offering the same amount as round 2, despite the value of her share significantly decreasing. We need to push for a more equitable split."
