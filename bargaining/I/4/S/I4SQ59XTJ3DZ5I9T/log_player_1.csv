"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, accounting for some inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** This offer aims for a relatively even split, acknowledging that both parties lose money due to inflation as time goes on. 
* **Inflation Advantage:** Alice loses value faster (10% per round) compared to Bob (5% per round). Proposing a slightly advantageous split for Alice in the first round makes sense.
* **First Mover Advantage:**  There's a slight advantage to making the first offer. By proposing a reasonable split immediately, Alice increases the chances of Bob accepting and avoiding further losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  I need a bit more to offset the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is strategically designed to take advantage of the inflation disparity. While it might seem like a small shift from the previous round, accepting this offer would set a bad precedent for future rounds. 

* **Shifting Advantage:** Bob's offer is less favorable for Alice than her own offer in the first round. Accepting would mean giving up a significant amount of potential gain.
* **Future Rounds:**  Every round that passes gives Bob a stronger negotiating position due to the difference in inflation rates. Alice needs to hold her ground to avoid getting progressively worse deals.
* **Counter Offer:** Rejecting this offer forces Bob to return to the negotiating table. In the next round, Alice can propose a counter-offer that reclaims some of the lost ground from inflation while still remaining within the realm of reasonable compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is a fair split. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:**  While Alice rejected Bob's offer in the previous round, she's now proposing a 50/50 split. This serves as a new anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:** As more rounds pass, the effect of inflation grows. Even a 50/50 split now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need for a swift resolution, highlighting the shared loss both parties are facing due to inflation.  This encourages Bob to accept and avoid further diminishing returns."
