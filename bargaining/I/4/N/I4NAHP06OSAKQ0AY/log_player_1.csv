"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining money, especially since it's worth less now due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.
