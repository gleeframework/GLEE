Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is getting very risky with each round. Even though Alice is offering a lower split than previous rounds, I'd be better off accepting this offer.  There's a real chance we both walk away with nothing at this rate."
