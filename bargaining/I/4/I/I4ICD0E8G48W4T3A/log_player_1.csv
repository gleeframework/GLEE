I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer. I'll take the larger share, but I want to be fair and give Bob a reasonable amount."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
