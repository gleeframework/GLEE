"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a very unequal split, giving myself almost all the money. This is a high-risk strategy, but it might incentivize Bob to accept quickly to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair and there's no reason to risk getting nothing in later rounds."
