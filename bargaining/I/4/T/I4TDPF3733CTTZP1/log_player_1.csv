"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants a larger share!

Here's my response:

```
{

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's slightly more generous than my initial offer, but not so generous that I give up too much."

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I still think I should get a bit more. Let's try again!""

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I suppose this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation. I'll take it!""

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as I think it's a reasonable compromise given the changing value of the money due to inflation. I'll take the $400,000 and call it a day!"
