"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 30% less than in the second round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a decent share of the remaining value."
