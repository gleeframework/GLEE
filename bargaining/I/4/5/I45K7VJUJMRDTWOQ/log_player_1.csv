 I propose to take 990,000$ and give Bob 10,000$.  This way, we both get something, and I minimize the risk of losing everything as the rounds progress.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 666667 
# Bob gain: 333333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer.  While it's less than I wanted initially, the inflation is a real threat.  This offer is a safe way to secure a significant amount of money before things get worse."
