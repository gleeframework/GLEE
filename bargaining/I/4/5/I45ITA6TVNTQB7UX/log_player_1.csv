Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. It's a more balanced offer that accounts for the potential inflation, but also ensures we both receive a significant share of the money.  
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
