"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a 40% share of the original 10,000 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is more beneficial for both of us in the long run.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4500 dollars is now worth 95% of its original value, while Bob's gain of 5500 dollars is now worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this offer. Can we discuss further?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4500 dollars in the previous round is now worth 90.75% of its original value (95% * 0.95), while Bob's gain of 5500 dollars is now worth 84% of its original value (90% * 0.9333...).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better share to account for the inflation.""
