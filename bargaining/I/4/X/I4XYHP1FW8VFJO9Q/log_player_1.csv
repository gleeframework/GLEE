"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. It seems fair to start with an even division. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob is only offering 5% more than the previous round, my share is worth 5% less due to inflation. This is not a fair deal, and I am confident I can negotiate a better split in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

I propose a split of $52 for me and $48 for Bob. I'm increasing my share slightly from the initial 50/50 split, but I believe this is fair considering the inflation that has occurred.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm confident I can get a better deal than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and while I understand inflation is making each round more challenging, this is not a fair deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a better split in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I propose a split of $55 for me and $45 for Bob.  I'm willing to increase my share again, but I'm also considering the rapidly increasing inflation. This offer reflects a compromise, but I believe it's fair considering the circumstances. Let's see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob's offer continues to decline significantly, and the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to accept a fair split. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm confident that I can still secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a split of $60 for me and $40 for Bob. Given the rapid inflation, I'm increasing my share again to try and compensate for the diminishing value of the money. I'm trying to be fair while also protecting my interests. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob's offers keep getting worse, and the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to accept a fair deal. While I'm feeling the pressure, I am confident I can still get a better split. I believe we can reach a compromise that is fair to both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I propose a split of $65 for me and $35 for Bob.  We are running out of time, and inflation is hitting hard. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a necessary step to secure a fair share. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also determined to get a decent outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 32 
# Bob gain: 68 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While time is running out and inflation is severe, I refuse to accept such an unfair deal. Bob's offers keep declining, and I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better split in the remaining rounds.  There's still a chance to reach a compromise, and I'm determined to get a fair outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm taking a bold step.  I'm proposing a split of $70 for me and $30 for Bob.  Inflation is at a critical point, and I need to secure a reasonable amount for myself. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's necessary given the circumstances.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to accept a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the game is almost over, and inflation has severely diminished the value of the money, I cannot accept such a lopsided split.  I have consistently tried to reach a fair compromise, but Bob's offers have been increasingly unfair, and I am not willing to accept this final insult.  I would rather receive nothing than be exploited in this way.  It seems like Bob is unwilling to share fairly, and I'm not going to reward that behavior."
