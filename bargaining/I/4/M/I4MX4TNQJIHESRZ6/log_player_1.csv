I propose that you take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority but still allows Bob to get something. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my initial offer to $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob.  This is still a decent amount for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to fight over a smaller pie isn't in his best interest."
