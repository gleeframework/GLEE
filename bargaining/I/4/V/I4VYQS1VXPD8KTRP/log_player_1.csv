"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'll give you 40% of the initial amount.""
}
```

Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! Let's split it more fairly. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept a smaller share this time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 300,000$. Thanks for the offer, Bob!"
