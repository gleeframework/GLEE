"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous offer considering I could try to take more. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer by framing it as a fair deal. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. How about a slightly more even split this time? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal. The offer is not significantly better than the one I made in the first round, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a more favorable split. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, let's end this. Inflation is eating away our money. This is a good compromise.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than in the first round, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer in the second round was not significantly better than my initial offer. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept by emphasizing the negative impact of inflation and framing the offer as a compromise. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
