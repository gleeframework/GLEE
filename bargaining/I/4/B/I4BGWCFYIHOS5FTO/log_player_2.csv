Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting anything less than 5000 in the later rounds means I'm losing a significant chunk of the initial value. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but I need to show I'm willing to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, we both lose out if this keeps going.""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is increasingly hurting me. Offering 4800 is still above the 50/50 split when considering the inflation, but shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal done. This offer is a last-ditch effort to secure a reasonable amount before the value diminishes even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not backing down. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation at 73.79%, even Alice's slightly improved offer is starting to look better than holding out and potentially getting nothing.  This is less about the deal being good and more about cutting my losses before the inflation eats away even more of the potential gain."
