"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in effect, my gain of $200,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer since I can potentially get more in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 160000,
  ""bob_gain"": 840000
}
```

I'll take $160,000 and leave Bob with $840,000."
