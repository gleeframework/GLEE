# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I've lost a significant amount due to inflation, and I don't want to risk losing even more. This offer is decent, and Bob seems willing to negotiate. It's time to settle and take what I can get."
