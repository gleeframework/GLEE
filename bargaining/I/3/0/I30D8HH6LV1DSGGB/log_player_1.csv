"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering to divide the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the uneven split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
