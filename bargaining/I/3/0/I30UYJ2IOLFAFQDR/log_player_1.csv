Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understanding the game's current state
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value remains the same for me (Alice) but decreases by 10% for Bob with each round. In the previous rounds, my offer was rejected by Bob, and I rejected Bob's offer in Round 2.

### Step 2: Considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gain
Since the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob each round, his gain is effectively less with each passing round. This means that if Bob were to accept the same amount in a later round, it would be worth less to him than if he had accepted it in an earlier round.

### Step 3: Formulating a new offer
Given that Bob's offer in Round 2 was for a 45-55 split and considering the impact of inflation, I should make an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money for Bob but still aims to find a mutually acceptable split.

### Step 4: Deciding on the specifics of the offer
I will offer Bob a slightly better deal than before, considering the inflation, but not so much that it disadvantages me significantly. A 58-42 split seems reasonable, given the circumstances.

### Step 5: Crafting the message to Bob
The message should convey a sense of urgency and reasonableness, encouraging Bob to accept the offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's end this before inflation gets the better of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal. Let's not risk losing more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Assessing the current offer from Bob
Bob is offering a 50-50 split in Round 4, emphasizing the fairness of the deal and the risk of losing more to inflation.

### Step 2: Considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gain
At this point, the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round due to inflation. This means that Bob is effectively getting less value from his share compared to if he had accepted a similar offer in an earlier round.

### Step 3: Evaluating the fairness of the offer considering inflation
Given the significant decrease in value for Bob due to inflation, a 50-50 split might not be as fair as it initially seems. However, it's also important to consider the risk of further devaluation if the game continues.

### Step 4: Weighing the pros and cons of accepting the offer
Accepting the offer guarantees me $50, which retains its full value. Rejecting the offer and continuing the game risks me ending up with less if Bob decides to offer less in the future or if we reach the 12-round limit without an agreement.

### Step 5: Making a decision based on the current offer and game state
Considering the fairness of the offer, the impact of inflation on Bob's gain, and the risk of further devaluation, accepting the 50-50 split seems like the most reasonable decision at this point.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
