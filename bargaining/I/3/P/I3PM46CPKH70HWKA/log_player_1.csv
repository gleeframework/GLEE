  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the hassle of further negotiations!"

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 285,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not happy with the deal, but I'll take it. Bob gets the majority of the money, and I get a small consolation prize."
