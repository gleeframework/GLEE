"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, my gain of 45 is worth 20% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round, but it's still more than the 45 I would get in the first round with the same split.

I accept the offer.
