"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money for myself, giving Bob a small amount just to incentivize him to accept the deal.  Since I'm going first, I want to maximize my potential gains.  I'll see how he reacts to this highly uneven split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than 500,000, Bob's offer is a fair split in the face of inflation. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and there's a risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers.  I'll take the 500,000 and end the game."
