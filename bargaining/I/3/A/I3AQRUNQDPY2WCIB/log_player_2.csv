"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after one round of inflation, the effective total is now $90.

I'll make a proposal that gives me a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective total is now $81.30 ($100 * 0.9 * 0.9).

Alice's offer is similar to her previous offer, but with a slightly larger share for me. However, I think I can do better.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 81.3% of its original value after three rounds of inflation, the effective total is now $81.30.

I'll make a proposal that takes into account the remaining value of the money and tries to get a better deal.
