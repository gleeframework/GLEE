"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly more aggressive offer. You can try to negotiate from here! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a bigger share from the start.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too aggressive for me. I'm thinking more like 55/45 or 56/44 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm trying to push back and see if Bob will meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns on this one. 55/45 seems like a fair split to me. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get a better deal.

I'll think about it for a moment... Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's share more significantly, I'm willing to meet him halfway. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with 52% for you. How about 50/50 again?""
}
```

I'm trying to get back to the original proposal, but with a bit of a twist."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 52/48 is the best I can do. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to compromise and meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think I can do better than this. Take a chance on me! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive as the rounds go on.

I'll think about it for a moment... Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's share even more, I'm starting to think that 45/55 might be a good compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the deal. 45/55 it is. Let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm hoping this is the final offer and we can wrap up the game!"
