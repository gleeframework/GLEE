I'm not sure how this inflation is working. It's only affecting Bob's gains, and it seems like a big disadvantage. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still decreasing, and it's getting increasingly unfair. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm starting to get worried about how much inflation is affecting him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offers. It seems like the inflation is disproportionately affecting him, and I'm hoping that by rejecting his offers, I can get a better deal in the next round.  However, I'm starting to worry that we might not reach an agreement before the time runs out."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm willing to take a chance. I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher amount than my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept, even though the inflation is affecting him so much. I'm running out of time and I don't want to lose everything."

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision. While I still believe the inflation is unfair and disproportionately affecting Bob, it's becoming increasingly clear that we might not reach an agreement at all.  There are only two rounds left, and if we don't agree, we both lose everything. It's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing."
