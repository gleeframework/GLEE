"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll try to get as much as I can. However, I don't want to give up too much either.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
