"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split because I'd like to gain more than $5,000. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slight edge.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to find a balance between getting a good share and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money continues to decrease due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $4,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob. The inflation has reduced the value of the money, so I'll take this offer to avoid further negotiations and secure a smaller but still decent share."
