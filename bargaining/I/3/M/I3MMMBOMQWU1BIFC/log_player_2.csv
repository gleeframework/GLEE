Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a better deal, but don't get too comfortable! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, this is better than nothing. Plus, I'm not sure how much longer this inflation will continue. Let's accept and move on."
