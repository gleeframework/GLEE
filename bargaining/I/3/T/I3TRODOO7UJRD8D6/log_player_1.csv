I'm going to be greedy and propose a 999,000/1,000 split in my favor.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount to get something, and I'll take advantage of the inflation risk if he declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing due to inflation in future rounds.  I'm sure Bob will be thrilled with the deal!"
