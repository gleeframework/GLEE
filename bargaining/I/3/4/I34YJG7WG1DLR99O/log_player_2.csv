"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can adjust in later rounds if you think it's too uneven. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1,000, it's not a good long-term strategy. It's too early in the game to give up such a large portion of the money. There's a good chance of getting a better deal in later rounds, especially if Alice starts feeling the pressure as the money loses value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, giving us both a good starting point. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 60/40 split is more fair considering the inflation. Let's find a middle ground! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than the first round, it's still too early to accept.  The inflation is starting to affect Alice's side more significantly, so there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better deal in later rounds if I continue to reject offers."
