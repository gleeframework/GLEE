"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
