"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money while still offering Bob something.  It's a ""take it or leave it"" approach.  

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 215687 
# Bob gain: 784313 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly more generous than the previous round, it's still not a good deal for Alice.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for Alice, so even though the proposed amount is higher, it's still less than what she initially offered. 

By rejecting, Alice is hoping to leverage the inflation to her advantage in the next round and get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is taking a risk here, but the inflation is playing a significant role in her decision.  The value of money is decreasing rapidly, so it's crucial to secure a large portion now.

This offer is a compromise between Alice's desire for a large share and the possibility that Bob might reject it again, leaving her with a potentially much smaller amount in the next round due to inflation."
