"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that we both get a significant share. Since I started, I'll take a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is fair in the beginning, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The game is long, and I can negotiate for more in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the value of the money is going down with each round. Let's make a deal.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was quite generous. I'll make a slight adjustment, but I still believe I should get the bigger share since I started. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm not convinced she needs to get the larger share just because she started. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I've adjusted my offer again, taking into account the inflation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us before we lose too much money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're both trying to find a middle ground. I'll make another adjustment, but I still think I should get the bigger share. The inflation is affecting me less than you, after all. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm holding out for a better deal, and I think we can still find a more equitable split before the inflation eats away too much of the money."
