This is a difficult choice, but as Alice, I need to hold out for a better deal.  Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable, and I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if we keep going.  While I'm losing nothing with each passing round, Bob is losing value at a faster rate. I believe that I can get closer to a 90/10 split if I keep rejecting his offers."

Although this is a much worse offer than I would have liked, I am forced to accept.  I have already rejected several of Bob's offers, and there is a risk that he will reject my next offer. The risk of getting nothing at all is too high at this point.  I'm disappointed but I'm also relieved to have secured at least some money."
