"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to reverse the roles this round, but I'm open to negotiation if you have a better idea. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer, but I'd like to counter with a slightly better deal for myself. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd prefer a 550,000 for me, 450,000 for you. It's still a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more this round.""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept.""
