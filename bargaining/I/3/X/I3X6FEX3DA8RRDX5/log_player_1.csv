Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives you a significant share, and we can finally end this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing for me with each round, accepting $400,000 (which is now worth significantly less due to inflation) is a terrible deal.  I need to hold out for a much better offer from Bob, even if it means risking another round of inflation."
