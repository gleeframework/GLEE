"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more generous offer than yours, let's see if you accept it 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if Bob's offer is really more generous, considering the inflation effect! 

But, I'll consider it. Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not losing out as much as Bob is. And 40 is a decent amount.
