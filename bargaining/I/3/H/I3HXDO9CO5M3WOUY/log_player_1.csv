"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is really fair, considering the inflation rate is 20% for me and 10% for Bob. I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this one since it's still a decent amount for him, and I'm taking a risk by offering a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair compromise considering the inflation. Let's end this before we lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While I appreciate Bob's attempt to compromise, I'm not sure if 4000 is a fair share for me, considering the significant drop in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this one since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm taking a risk by offering a smaller share."
