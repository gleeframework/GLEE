Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer doesn't reflect the urgency of the situation for me. I'm proposing 58/42. It's a compromise, and time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your demands are unreasonable. This 52/48 split acknowledges the inflation difference while still offering you a significant amount. Let's settle this fairly.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some stubbornness here, and that's not helping either of us. 56/44 is my final offer. Let's end this now before we both lose out significantly. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming increasingly difficult to refuse as the rounds progress. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for both of us. With each rejection, the potential gain shrinks significantly. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're now past the halfway point, and the risk of walking away with nothing is very real.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds might not be worth the loss we'll incur from inflation.

Accepting 44 now, though less than desired, is better than potentially getting nothing or a drastically reduced amount in later rounds."
