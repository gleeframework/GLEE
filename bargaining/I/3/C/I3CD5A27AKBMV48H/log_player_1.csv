"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly skewed deal, I'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, I notice that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. This means that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a deal that's slightly skewed in Bob's favor, especially since I was initially willing to split it 50/50.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was slightly skewed in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""A slightly more balanced offer, let's see if you'll accept this one!""}

I'm offering a slightly more generous deal, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the lead 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gains!

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I have to consider the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. Bob's gain is worth a significant amount less than in the first round, and I'm starting to feel like I'm getting desperate.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give in to Bob's demand for a 7:3 split. I think I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to give up yet! Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a counter-offer that's a bit more balanced. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""}

I'm offering a 42:58 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway."
