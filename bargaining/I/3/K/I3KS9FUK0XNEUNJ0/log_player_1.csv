"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the inflation factor. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer.
