"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a good starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, especially since I'm getting a smaller share than before due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer a 55/45 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still not too extreme."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm surprised Bob is willing to give me such a large share, especially considering the effects of inflation. I think I've been pushing for a fair deal, and this offer seems reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 75/25 split."
