"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and split it evenly. A fair deal is better than risking losing it all. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I could aim for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of losing everything due to inflation or Bob's potential greed in later rounds."
