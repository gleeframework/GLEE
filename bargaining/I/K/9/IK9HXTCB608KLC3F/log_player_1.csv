"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll get the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $47.50 in the first round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
