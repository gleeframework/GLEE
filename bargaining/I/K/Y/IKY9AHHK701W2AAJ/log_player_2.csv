Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve the larger share. Let's avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering more, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer I wait, the worse it gets for me, but accepting a deal this bad this early sets a terrible precedent for future rounds. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair share."
