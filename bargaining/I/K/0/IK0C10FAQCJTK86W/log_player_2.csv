Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about a 52/48 split in my favor?  It's a slight increase from your offer, acknowledging that I'm taking on more risk as time goes on.  We should try to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes the value further. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
