"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leave you with a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is now worth less to me, so I need to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly bigger share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to keep a slightly larger share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leave you with something 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is now worth significantly less to me, so I need to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle. I'm willing to give you an equal share.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair and equal split, and I think this is a reasonable proposal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
