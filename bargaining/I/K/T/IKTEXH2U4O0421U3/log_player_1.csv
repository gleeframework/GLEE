Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less each round, I'll try to take advantage of this and offer him a bit less than half, while still being somewhat reasonable. My message to Bob is ""Let's be reasonable"" to try to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept my offer."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressured to accept Bob's offer. Additionally, I think I can get a better deal than $450,000, considering I initially offered Bob $400,000 and he rejected it. Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not falling for it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less for Bob than it was in the first round, and 36% less than in the first round ((1 - 0.8) + (1 - 0.8)*(1 - 0.8)). I'll offer Bob a bit less than in the first round, while still trying to appear reasonable.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, this is a fair deal. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With each passing round, Bob's money is worth significantly less due to inflation. In this round, his share is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. Despite this, Bob's offer of $520,000 for me is still not as good as I think I can get, considering the rapidly decreasing value of his share. His message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to take advantage of the situation in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

I'll offer Bob a significantly smaller share than in the first round, while still trying to appear somewhat reasonable. My message to Bob is ""Time to get real"" to try to convey that I'm aware of the decreasing value of his share and that he should accept my offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Time to get real""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
