"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to consider my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of $6,000 in the previous round. I'm not sure if Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, due to the cumulative inflation. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for 50/50, but I'm not willing to give up that much. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. You can't have it all, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering that my gain of $4,000 in this round is worth less than my gain of $6,000 in the first round, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

However, I'm not convinced that I should give Bob a larger share. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 60.8% less than in the first round, due to the cumulative inflation. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll try to find a sweet spot!""
}
```"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I think I can still squeeze out a bit more. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. Considering that my gain of $3,000 in this round is worth even less than my gain of $6,000 in the first round, I'll think carefully about Bob's final offer.

However, I'm not convinced that I should give Bob such a large share, especially since he's calling it his ""final offer"". I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
