"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'd like to see a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Will you accept this offer?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a slight advantage. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems more reasonable this time around.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm taking the $4,000, and I hope it's enough to make it worth my while."
