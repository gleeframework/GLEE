"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so generous after all!

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite!

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting the better deal, but I'll still take it!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the 10% decrease in value, but I'm still trying to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more games! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a fair deal now!

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50-50 split, and I'm happy to end the game here!"
