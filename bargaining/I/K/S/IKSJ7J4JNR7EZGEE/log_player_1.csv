"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division, but with a slight bias in my favor. The message is intentionally not too pushy, as I want to leave room for negotiation and see how Bob reacts.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. Please relay his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll respond with a decision to reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe reasoning is that while the offer might seem fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I'll get the chance to make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a larger share.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see how it goes!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this offer, I've increased my share slightly compared to Bob's previous offer, but still tried to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to him. The message emphasizes the need to consider the inflation and find a mutually agreeable solution.\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts to this offer!"
