"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good deal and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50-50 split, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this 50-50 split. I was hoping for a better deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
