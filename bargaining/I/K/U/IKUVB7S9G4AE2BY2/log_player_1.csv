I'm going to start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, as it's a significant advantage for me, but still leaves Bob with something.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. The inflation is making the money worth less with each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something."
