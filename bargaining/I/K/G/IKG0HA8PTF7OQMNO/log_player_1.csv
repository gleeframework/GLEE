"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a division where I take $55 and Bob takes $45, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of this by taking a bit more than half, while still presenting it as a fair offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but that offer wasn't fair. Let's be reasonable - this benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his message suggesting it's a reasonable and mutually beneficial offer, the division he proposes is actually quite skewed in his favor, especially considering that the money is worth 20% less to him due to inflation. By rejecting, I aim to make a counteroffer that takes into account the devaluation of money for Bob, hoping to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is more than fair for both of us.""}\n\nGiven that the money loses 20% of its value for Bob with each round, and we're now in the third round, the effective value of the money for Bob is significantly less than for me. My offer reflects this imbalance by proposing that I take $60 and Bob takes $40. The message aims to justify this division by pointing out the impact of inflation, suggesting that this offer is more than fair considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, despite the money being worth significantly less to him due to inflation, he's still willing to offer a 50/50 split. Given that this is his final offer and considering the decreasing value of money for Bob, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting now guarantees me $50, which is still worth its full value to me, rather than risking further negotiations where Bob might offer less due to the increasing impact of inflation on his share.\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
