Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 70/30, with me taking 70 and you getting 30.  This is still a good deal for both of us, given the inflation we've seen. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70
