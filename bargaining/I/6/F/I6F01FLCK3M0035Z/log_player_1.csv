"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and leave 20% for Bob. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can divide the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try to get more! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of the original $50 from the previous round, due to the 10% inflation.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $50 is worth the same amount as in the previous round, since we don't know how the inflation affects him.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
