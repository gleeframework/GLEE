"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or decline!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me, and now Bob is trying to take advantage of it!

Considering the offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting $400,000 now against the potential for a better deal in future rounds.

After some thought, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to be a bit more aggressive this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a decent share""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 460k is still too much 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject it. With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more cautious.

However, $460,000 is still a decent amount, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. After some thought, I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
