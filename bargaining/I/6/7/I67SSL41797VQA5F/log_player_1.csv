"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk of the money to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution.  We both get a significant amount and there's no need for further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With a 50/50 split, I'd be getting $500,000, which is still a good amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation factor, the money I gain will be worth the same as in the previous round, but the money Bob gains will be worth 20% less.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40% of the total. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to give you 40%, but I need at least 60% to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's avoid further rounds and come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the previous rounds. I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous rounds.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and 40% is a relatively small share. I'll accept this offer.
