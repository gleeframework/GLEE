"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm taking the risk of the next round's inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to counter my initial offer with a similar split, but with a slight adjustment to account for the risk of future inflation.

However, I'm not convinced that I'm taking on too much risk, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim to take a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair deal!""
}
```"
