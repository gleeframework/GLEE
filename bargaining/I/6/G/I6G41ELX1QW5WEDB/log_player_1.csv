"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $550,000 and give Bob $450,000. The message attached is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, suggesting that taking a bit more than half is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation, considering the impact of inflation on both players' gains over subsequent rounds if the offer is not accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I think 55/45 is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, accepting 45% of the money in the second round doesn't seem favorable, especially considering the significant difference in how inflation affects our gains. By rejecting, I aim to leverage the pressure of further inflation in subsequent rounds to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm slightly reducing my initial proposal to $525,000 for myself and increasing Bob's share to $475,000, aiming to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob, especially considering that the value of the money decreases with each round. The message emphasizes the impact of inflation, suggesting that finding an agreement sooner rather than later benefits both parties."
