"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll let you have a small share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up such a large majority to Bob. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself."

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still want the majority. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a share that's even smaller than the previous offer. I'll wait for a better deal."
