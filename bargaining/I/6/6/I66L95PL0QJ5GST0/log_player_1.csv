"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given that the money is worth less each round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less each round, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable. I'll accept his proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
