Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
