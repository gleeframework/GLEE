Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, don't wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean I get less than half of the original value due to inflation. It's a gamble, but I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - it's more than fair considering the time crunch we're both under.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and so is the value of your share. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me.  While 30/70 isn't a great split, it's better than getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. The value of my share will only continue to plummet."
