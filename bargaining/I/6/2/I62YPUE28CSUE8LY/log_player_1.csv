"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly.""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds, considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gains but not mine. I also started with a higher offer for myself, so I'm not ready to settle for 45 just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than my initial one, taking into account that the inflation is affecting Bob's gains. By pointing this out in the message, I'm trying to make Bob realize that accepting this offer might be a good idea before the inflation reduces his potential gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's settle on a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which might seem fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, a 50/50 split is actually skewed in my favor. However, I believe I can get an even better deal if I hold out a bit longer, so I'll reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, don't wait any longer.""}\n\nI'm increasing my share of the money, taking advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is worth less and less due to inflation. By emphasizing the impact of inflation in my message, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure Bob into accepting my offer before his potential gains dwindle even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer - it's more than fair considering the time crunch we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's claim that this is his final offer, I'm not convinced that he won't come back with a better deal if I reject it. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which means that his 48 is actually worth much less than that. I'll hold out for a better offer, as I believe I have the upper hand in these negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, and so is the value of your share.""}\n\nI'm making an even more aggressive offer, taking advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is rapidly losing value due to inflation. By emphasizing the time pressure and the decreasing value of his share, I'm trying to force Bob into accepting my offer, which is increasingly favorable to me."
