"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, you can try to do better in the next round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm really trying to get the better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to be fair this time, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50 in terms of purchasing power.

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering I'm getting less than I initially proposed in the first round. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50 in terms of purchasing power.

I'll try to take advantage of Bob's previous offer, which was 50-50. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said you'd be fair, so I'll give you 45, you can try to do better next time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to the middle, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $45 is actually worth $38.58 in terms of purchasing power.

I notice that Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which is actually a 10% increase in his share compared to my previous offer. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm willing to consider it.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob is being entirely honest with his message. He says he's trying to get closer to the middle, but his offer is actually more skewed in his favor than my previous offer. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $45 is actually worth $38.58 in terms of purchasing power.

I'll try to take advantage of Bob's previous offer, which was a 55-45 split. I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is a slight improvement for me.

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's just split it down the middle, no need to haggle""
