"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60-40 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```

It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%). Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 54,
  ""bob_gain"": 46,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. How about a 54-46 split?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, which I think is a more balanced offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
