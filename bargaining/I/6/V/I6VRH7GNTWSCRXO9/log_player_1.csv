"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100, and we can split the game right down the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
