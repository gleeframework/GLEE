**Reasoning:**

Alice is budging, but very slowly.  The rate of our losses to inflation is significant. While her offer is tempting, holding out a bit longer might push her to make a more substantial concession in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing it all. This offer is a fair compromise and secures a good amount for both of us before inflation eats away any more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

We need to start becoming more insistent, as time is running out. This offer shows a willingness to compromise, meeting closer to her offers, but still emphasizes the need for a deal due to inflation."
