{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer.  While it's a decent amount, I want to see if I can get more. I'm aware of the inflation, but I think I can secure a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself.  I'm confident that she'll accept this offer, as it's still a decent amount for her, and she's likely aware of the inflation factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer again.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal.  Alice's offer is closer to being even, and I think I can push for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, giving Alice $3,500 and keeping $6,500 for myself.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm still confident in my ability to secure a good deal."
