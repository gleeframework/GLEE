Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that inflation hurts me more than her.  While this offer is tempting, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting anything less than 500,000 at this point is a significant loss for me in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but this is absolutely my last offer. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I need to convey a sense of urgency and finality to Alice.  By framing this offer as non-negotiable, I increase the chances of her accepting a deal that, while not ideal, still gives me a slight advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your last offer, but I think you'll consider this one 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While this offer isn't ideal, rejecting it means risking losing even more to inflation in the following rounds. Accepting 440,000 now is better than potentially getting a much smaller amount later, or even nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement."
