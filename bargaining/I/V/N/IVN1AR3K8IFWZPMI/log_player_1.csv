"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large majority of the money.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to be cautious and try to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, given the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to split evenly, it's a good deal for me. I'll take it."
