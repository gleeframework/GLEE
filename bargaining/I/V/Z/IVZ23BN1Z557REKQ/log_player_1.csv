  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can split the money fairly and avoid further negotiations."

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to try to get more money. Meeting halfway means I'll get $5,000, which is less than my initial offer of $6,000. I'll wait for a better offer."
