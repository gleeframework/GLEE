I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to increase my offer slightly from the previous round, but still maintain a significant advantage. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
