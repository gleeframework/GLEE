"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get the larger share and set a good precedent for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. My initial reaction is to reject this offer, as I was hoping to get a larger share. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that I can do better in future rounds.
