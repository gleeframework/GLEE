"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk too. What do you say?

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but it's still not fair.  Let's split the difference. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. We both get a decent share, and we can move on to better things. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on her share.  We're only on round 3, so there's room to negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but we need to factor in the time pressure.  This is a compromise - a bit over half for me to account for the decreasing value on your end. Let's close this out.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  Let's be practical and split this evenly. We both get a significant amount, and we don't risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While we were pushing for a slightly better split, Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the time pressure and the increasing impact of inflation on her share. Accepting now guarantees a good outcome for both of us and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
