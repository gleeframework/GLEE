# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rates.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up 80% of the remaining money, especially with the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the 85-15 split, but I'm not sure I want to risk going into Round 5 either...

```

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the 90-10 split, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate...
