"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. This seems fair since I'm making the initial offer, and I'm willing to share a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8550, ""bob_gain"": 1450}
```

I propose to keep $8,550 for myself and give Bob $1,450.  While I'm still taking the majority, I'm increasing Bob's share slightly to incentivize him to accept.  I'm hoping to avoid another round of inflation, as it's starting to hurt my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting a significantly smaller share than I initially wanted, accepting this offer is the best option.  The inflation is rapidly diminishing my potential earnings, and continuing to reject offers could lead to me getting nothing at all.  It's better to take the $2,000 than risk losing it all."
