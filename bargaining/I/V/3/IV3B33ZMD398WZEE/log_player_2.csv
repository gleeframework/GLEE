Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice's initial offer was a 90/10 split, I'll try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 19% less, so I need to be careful not to get too greedy. This offer is a 40/60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Alice than the initial 90/10 split. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was a 40/60 split, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a 50/50 split. This way, I'll get a larger share of the remaining money, which is still worth 19% less due to inflation.
