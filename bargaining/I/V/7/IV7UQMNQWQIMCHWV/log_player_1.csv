"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1. I'll take 80% now. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like Bob is being a bit greedy!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $20 is actually worth 80% of its original value, which is $16. But I'll still have to accept the offer since I don't want to proceed to the next round and lose even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
