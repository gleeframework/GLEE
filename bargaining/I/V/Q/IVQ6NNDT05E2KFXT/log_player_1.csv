Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,

}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 60 dollars is actually worth 60 * 0.9 = 54 dollars, and Bob's gain of 40 dollars is actually worth 40 * 0.95 = 38 dollars.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 54 dollars."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 60 dollars in the previous round is now worth 54 * 0.9 = 48.6 dollars. I'll aim to get a bit more this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more!""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I still want a slight edge. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 55 dollars in the previous round is now worth 55 * 0.7273 = 39.95 dollars (27.1% less than the original 55 dollars).

Bob's gain of 50 dollars is now worth 50 * 0.8574 = 42.87 dollars (14.26% less than the original 50 dollars).

Considering the values, I think I can accept this offer:

```
