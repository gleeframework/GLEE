"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair start to the game! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split seems generous, it's important to remember that the money is worth less each round, and Alice's offer is still significantly more advantageous to her. I'll see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need more for myself to make this worthwhile. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still more advantageous to her, and the inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of the money for me. I need to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a larger portion to compensate for the inflation. Let's find a solution that is mutually beneficial before the value of our gains becomes even smaller.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm making a stronger offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer isn't ideal, the inflation is quickly diminishing the value of the money for both of us. Accepting this offer ensures we both get something, and any further negotiation might result in both of us getting nothing."
