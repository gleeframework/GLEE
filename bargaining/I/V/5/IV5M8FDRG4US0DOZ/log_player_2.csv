"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a fair share while still acknowledging my initial advantage. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem entirely fair to me, considering the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains. I believe there's room for a more balanced division.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Alice responds to my decision. I'm ready to make my proposal in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for us! This offer still gives you a good share while acknowledging the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice's message emphasizes the time pressure and the impact of inflation, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Given that the money I gain is worth 9.75% less and Alice's gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, I think a more favorable division for me is possible. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer.\n\n###\nPlease let me know how Alice responds to my decision. I'm ready to make my next proposal."

I'm looking forward to Alice's response."
