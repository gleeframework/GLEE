"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward start to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40-60, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself, considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is similar to my previous offer, but with a slightly more generous share for himself, I'll think carefully about it. Considering the accelerating inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me a fixed amount that's decreasing in value. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money being worth 19.38% less than in the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings! With the money being worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'm starting to feel the pinch. Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him, but I don't want to give up yet. I'll think carefully about it... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the accelerating inflation."
