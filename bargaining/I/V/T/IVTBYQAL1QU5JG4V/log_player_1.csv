"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob a significant amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Since Bob's offer is now 50/50, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. Bob's offer is still 50/50, but considering the inflation, I'm actually getting a slightly better deal than in the previous round. I'll accept this offer.
