"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I deserve only 40% of the total, so I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly lower share than in my initial proposal, but still a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

After considering the offers and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'll accept his offer and take $4,800."
