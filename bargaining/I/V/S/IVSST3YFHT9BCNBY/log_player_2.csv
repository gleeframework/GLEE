"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm looking to maximize my share. Even though Alice's proposal seems fair, there's no reason for me to accept it in the first round. I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The deal's getting worse for you, Bob. Time to be realistic! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is making my options worse with each passing round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least some profit, which is better than the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
