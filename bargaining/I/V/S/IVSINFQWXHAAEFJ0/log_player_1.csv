"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm trying to be generous, but also make sure I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering you a 40% share, which is still more than you'll get if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I should aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2. I'll aim to get an even larger share to account for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being very generous, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. Let's split the money fairly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if it's a genuine attempt to find a fair split or just a way to get me to accept a lower share.

Considering the significant inflation, I think I should aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. However, I also don't want to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm keeping a close eye on Bob's intentions.
