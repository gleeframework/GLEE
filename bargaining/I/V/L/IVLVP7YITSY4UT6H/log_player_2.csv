Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** This is a critical point in the game. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob with each round. 
* **Alice is stalling:**  Her messages suggest she's trying to wear Bob down to accept a less favorable deal. She's hoping the fear of losing even more to inflation will make him concede.
* **A better strategy:** By rejecting this offer, Bob forces Alice to make a decision in the next round where the inflation impact will be even more significant for Bob. This might push her to propose a more balanced offer to avoid Bob rejecting it and taking a gamble on the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Last chance Alice! Inflation is about to hit us both hard.  Take this deal and we both win.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This is the penultimate round.  Bob needs to convey a sense of urgency.
* **Shifting Blame:** By framing the next round's inflation as a loss for *both* players, Bob adds pressure on Alice.  It's no longer just about Bob losing out.
* **Strategic Retreat:** While Bob ideally wants a 50/50 split, offering 48/52 shows a willingness to compromise *slightly*. This could be enough to entice Alice to accept before the final round where the stakes are even higher."
