"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to get a better deal!

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 30 * 0.8 = 24 dollars. Not bad, but I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 36 is a fair share for me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36-64 split, with me getting 36 dollars and Bob getting 64 dollars. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Let me calculate my gain in the original dollars, before inflation: 20 / 0.517 (1 - 0.483) = 38.7 dollars.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure if I want to risk waiting for a better deal. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
