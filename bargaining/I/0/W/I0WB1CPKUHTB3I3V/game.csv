6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases for me with each round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It accounts for the time pressure but is also more equitable.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,Your offer is still not accounting enough for the decreasing value for me. Let's meet in the middle with 58/42. Time is running out!,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Alice, I understand the time pressure is on you more than me. But I need a fair deal. This is my final offer.",Bob,4,
