"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30% share, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is offering a bigger share than before, I'll accept this offer.
