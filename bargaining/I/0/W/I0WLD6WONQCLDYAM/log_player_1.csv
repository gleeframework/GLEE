I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a decent starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob thinks it's unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and the money is losing value with each round. It's better to take this deal now."
