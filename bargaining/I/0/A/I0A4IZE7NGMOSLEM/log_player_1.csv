"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take the 1000 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll take it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
