"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This considers the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this round, Bob has proposed a division where I take $4500 and he takes $5500. Considering the inflation, his gain is actually worth 10% less than the face value, so his real gain is $4950. Given the time pressure and the fact that I still have a chance to make counter-offers in future rounds, I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob's offer was not acceptable, I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll take into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round. I'll offer a division where I take $5800 and Bob takes $4200. I'll include a message to Bob pointing out that his share is still substantial, despite the decreasing value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out. This is a reasonable offer that accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob has proposed a division where I take $4800 and he takes $5200.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob has proposed a division where I take $5000 and he takes $5000. Considering the inflation, his gain is actually worth 40.95% less than the face value, so his real gain is approximately $2953. Given the decreasing value of the money for Bob, his ""final offer"" is actually quite generous to me. However, I'll keep in mind that Bob's share will continue to decrease in value, and I might be able to get a better deal in future rounds. Nevertheless, considering the relatively small difference in our proposed splits and the risk of the game ending with no deal, I'll accept this offer.
