"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly biased offer, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a $2,000 advantage over me, even if it's a ""good starting point"". I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
