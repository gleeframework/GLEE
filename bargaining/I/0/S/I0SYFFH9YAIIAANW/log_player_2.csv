"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I think we can be more fair.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that's heavily skewed against me.  Let's get this done and move on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one, and it's getting close to crunch time! However, Alice is essentially mirroring Bob's previous offer, which wasn't overly generous.  There's a chance to negotiate a better deal still."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is literally evaporating! I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a slight edge for me, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we wait any longer.""}
