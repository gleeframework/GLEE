"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I'll reject this offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob offered a 70-30 split last round, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations again due to the inflation.

I'll reject this offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the increasing inflation. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly smaller share. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
