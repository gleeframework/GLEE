**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on! While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me due to inflation. 

* Accepting this round gives me $440,000 (which is worth significantly less than it was in earlier rounds).
* Rejecting means risking getting even less in future rounds if Alice continues to play hardball.

It's a tough choice, but at this point, getting something is better than getting nothing if the negotiations completely fall apart."
