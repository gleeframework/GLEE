Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm taking the lead here! I'm confident that I can get a better deal for myself. Let's see if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced yet. I want a better deal! I think I can still get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of increasing my share gradually. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but if she rejects it again, I'll have to reconsider my approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. With the inflation, my share is getting smaller with each passing round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  A 50/50 split is fair in this situation."
