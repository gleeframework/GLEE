"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is 40% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

After calculating the effective value of the money, I realize that Bob's offer is actually a decent one. The 450,000 I'd get is worth about 84% of the original 600,000 I proposed, and the 550,000 Bob gets is worth about 91% of the original 600,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
