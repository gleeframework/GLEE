Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. It's my turn now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial offer.  While not ideal, I'm willing to negotiate, but not by simply switching places. I need to incentivize him to offer me something better in the next round."
