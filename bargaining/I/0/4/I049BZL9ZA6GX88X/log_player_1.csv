Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I believe this offer still reflects the inflation advantage you'll gain in later rounds.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right that the inflation factor theoretically benefits me more in later rounds, his offers are still heavily skewed in his favor.  He's banking on me getting desperate and accepting a low amount to avoid getting nothing.  I need to show him I'm willing to play hardball too."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's end this now with a perfectly fair 50/50 split.  Otherwise, this is just a pointless waste of both our time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to switch tactics.  Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor.  By offering a perfectly even split, I'm calling his bluff. It will be difficult for him to justify rejecting a 50/50 deal and he'll be forced to either concede or reveal that he's not negotiating in good faith."
