"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30, and I'll take 70.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60, you can give me 40. It's a fair split, but I'm keeping a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 60 is worth 60 * 0.8 = 48 dollars, which is 32 dollars less than what I would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, and I'll take 55. I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of 45 is worth 45 * 0.8 = 36 dollars, which is 14 dollars less than what I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of the situation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
