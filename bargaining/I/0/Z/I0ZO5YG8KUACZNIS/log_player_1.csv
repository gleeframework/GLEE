"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, this is a good starting point""}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the initial $100. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the new offer, as it's even more skewed towards Bob's favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more aggressive split.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, hoping that he'll see the value in it."
