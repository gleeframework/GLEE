"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. This is my last offer. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer seems extremely unfair, it's in Bob's best interest to reject it. Even though the money is worth less each round for Alice, it's still worth more to her than to Bob.  Rejecting this offer means Bob gets to make the proposal in the next round, potentially getting a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal.  We both get something, and we can move on with our lives.  Accept this, or face the consequences of inflation!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This is a fair deal, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob still gets a much smaller share, the situation has changed significantly due to inflation.  Alice's offer is more reasonable now, and accepting it is the best way to end this game and secure at least something. Waiting for another round could lead to even less money for Bob due to continued inflation."
