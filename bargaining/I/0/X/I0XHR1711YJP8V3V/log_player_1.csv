"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose taking 99 dollars for myself and giving Bob 1 dollar. I figure this is a good starting point, as the money will lose value for him more quickly than for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to take the 50 dollars now than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
