"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept this initial proposal or if we need to negotiate further."
