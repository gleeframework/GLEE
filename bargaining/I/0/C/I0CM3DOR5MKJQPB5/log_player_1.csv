"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I've included a message that says ""Let's divide fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness, but the longer we play, the less the money is worth. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob $550,000 and me $450,000, especially considering the significant difference in how inflation affects us. I'll try to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable compromise""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 52.5-47.5 split, with me getting $525,000 and Bob getting $475,000. Given the effects of inflation, I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I've included a message to Bob explaining my reasoning, in the hopes that he'll see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the same offer you just made, but with the shares reversed.  Let's be reasonable and end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth significantly less with each passing round, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob the larger share. Given the asymmetrical effects of inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'll try to make another proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""50-50 split to minimize further loss""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 50-50 split, with both of us getting $500,000. Given the significant effects of inflation, I believe this is a fair offer that minimizes further loss for both of us. By splitting the money equally, we can both walk away with a reasonable amount, considering the circumstances. I've included a message to Bob explaining my reasoning, in the hopes that he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
