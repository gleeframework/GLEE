# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him, but it's not a bad deal. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation! My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I need to be careful.

Bob's offer is 75 for me and 25 for him, which is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. I'm hoping to get an even better deal for myself."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer due to inflation! My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and it's getting harder to make ends meet.

I'll try to make a strong offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game soon. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think this is my best offer. Accept and let's end this!""
}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! My gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, and I'm getting worried that I might end up with nothing.

However, Bob's offer is a good one - 90 for me and 10 for him is a very generous offer, considering the current state of the money. I'm not sure if I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and hope that I can get a decent amount of money out of this deal."
