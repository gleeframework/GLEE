Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's better to start with a more equal split. I'm offering 55/45, since I'm the one proposing this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm getting a worse deal with each round, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile.  This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go back to the 40/60 split you proposed in the first round. I understand you need a bigger share to make it worthwhile, and I'm hoping we can reach a compromise before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob's offer is now the same as what I originally proposed.  While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll become less generous in subsequent rounds as the money is worth less to him. It's better to take the guaranteed win now."
