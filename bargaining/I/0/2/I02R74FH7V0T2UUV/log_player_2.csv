Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm getting a worse deal with each round, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
