This is a tough one! It's getting tempting to accept as the value decreases. However,  I'm betting Alice is getting worried as we're past the halfway point. Holding out a bit longer might force her to give a better offer."

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is toying with me!  She says my 50/50 split was ""good"" but offers me even less. This likely means time is getting to her more than she's letting on.  I need to hold my nerve a little longer."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alright Alice, no more games. This is my final offer. It's a slight edge to you, but it's the best I can do with the time crunch.  Let's end this.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said no more games, but I think you're still playing. Let's get real, my offer is the best you'll get 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is it.  Alice is clearly unwilling to budge and the value is only going down from here.  If I reject this, I risk getting even less in a later round. It's not ideal, but better to take this offer than risk getting nothing at all."
