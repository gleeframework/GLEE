"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 40 dollars (80% of 50).

I'm not sure if I want to split the money 50/50, but it's a decent offer, and it's getting harder to make a better one with each passing round. I'll accept this offer.
