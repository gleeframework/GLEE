"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, as the value of money is decreasing rapidly. Let's split it fairly and move on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
