Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial deal. Consider this offer carefully - time is running out and we both lose with every round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. This offer is still a good deal for you, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting Alice's offer now would mean losing over 60% of my potential initial gain.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more substantial share, even with the increasing inflation. I'm hoping she'll be more open to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal. Let's end this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out.  Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Demonstrates fairness:**  It's a clear and universally understood concept. 
* **Highlights the urgency:**  The message emphasizes that every round wasted is a loss for both sides. 

Hopefully, this convinces Alice to settle rather than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
