"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid wasting time and risking further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of me with a 90/10 split. I'm not falling for it. I'll offer you a better deal if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take advantage of me now!

I'm not going to fall for his trap. His offer is actually worse than my original one, considering the inflation. I'll reject his offer and try to make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a new offer for the next round."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a compromise. This way, we both get a decent share and avoid further losses due to inflation.""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me!

Considering the inflation, my $550,000 from the previous round is now worth $472,100. Bob's offer is still not very appealing, but I'll think about it.

However, I'm not going to accept his offer. I'll try to make a new proposal that's more favorable to me.
