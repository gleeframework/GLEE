"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, a 70-30 split is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a better deal than before, but I need to make sure I get a fair share. Let's try an 80-20 split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still need a decent share. 60-40 is my final offer 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 60-40 split isn't ideal, given the inflation and the fact Alice is becoming increasingly desperate, it's the best option available. I'm likely to get a worse deal in the next round if I reject this."
