"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to set a high standard for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 95-5 split. I think it's more fair given the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

I'm not willing to accept a 5% share, especially considering the significant difference from the original offer. I'll reject this proposal and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less in Round 3.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a 70-30 split is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still trying to maintain a significant advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a better deal than before, but I need to make sure I get a fair share. Let's try an 80-20 split. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gain. However, I'm not willing to accept an 80-20 split, especially considering the significant drop in value.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still need a decent share. 60-40 is my final offer""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still trying to maintain a significant advantage. This is my last stand before I have to accept a much worse deal due to inflation."
