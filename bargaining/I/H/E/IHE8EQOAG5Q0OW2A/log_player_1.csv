"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to calculate the actual amounts I'd get:

* My gain: 200,000
* Bob's gain: 800,000

Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of 200,000 is actually worth 180,000 in real terms. However, I don't know how much Bob's gain is affected by inflation.

Given the message and the offer, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take $300,000, and I'll keep the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the adjusted amount, and Bob will get 30%."
