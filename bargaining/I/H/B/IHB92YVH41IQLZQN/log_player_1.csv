"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to start with a higher offer to account for the potential loss. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable proposal and accept it, ending the game early and minimizing the impact of inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating our potential gains, Alice. Let's be realistic: I take 600,000, you take 400,000 and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the impact of inflation, accepting a 40-60 split in his favor would mean I'm giving up too much of the original amount. Since I started with a 60-40 proposal in my favor and Bob rejected it, I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I'll get to make the next proposal and try to find a more favorable split, while also considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI am making a revised offer that slightly reduces my share from the initial proposal, taking into account the impact of inflation and Bob's counteroffer. By offering a 58-42 split in my favor, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is meant to convey a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to consider this proposal more favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical.  This offer secures a good amount for both of us. Let's close the deal and avoid losing even more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, although the impact of inflation is becoming more significant, accepting a 42-58 split in his favor still doesn't align with my goal of securing a more substantial share. Given that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I believe there's still room to find a more favorable division. By rejecting this offer, I'll have the opportunity to make another proposal and attempt to find a compromise that better suits me, despite the decreasing value of the money."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Split the difference""}\n\nI am making a revised offer that further reduces my share from the previous proposals, acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation and Bob's counteroffers. By offering a 56-44 split in my favor, I'm attempting to find a compromise that takes into account the loss of value over time. The message ""Split the difference"" is meant to convey a sense of willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution and encourage Bob to consider this proposal more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking. This offer is more than fair considering the lost value due to inflation.  Let's be smart and take it. 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I am rejecting Bob's offer because, although the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant, accepting a 44-56 split in his favor still doesn't meet my expectations. Given that we're halfway through the rounds, I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating to try to find a more favorable division. By rejecting this offer, I'll have the opportunity to make another proposal and attempt to find a compromise that better suits me, despite the decreasing value of the money.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I am rejecting Bob's offer because, although the impact of inflation is substantial, accepting a 46-54 split in his favor would mean I've compromised too much. With only four rounds left, I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating to try to find a more favorable division. Bob's message is trying to create a sense of urgency, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I'll have the opportunity to make another proposal and attempt to find a compromise that better suits me.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

By offering a 52-48 split in my favor, I'm attempting to find a compromise that acknowledges the loss of value over time and the need to reach an agreement soon. The message ""Last chance for a good deal"" is meant to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider this proposal more seriously, as the next rounds will only decrease the value of the money further."
