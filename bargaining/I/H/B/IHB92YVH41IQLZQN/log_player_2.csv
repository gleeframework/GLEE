# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While it seems like a fair split at first glance, the impact of inflation makes this a bad deal for me (Bob). I need to push for a larger share in the early rounds to maximize my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating our potential gains, Alice. Let's be realistic: I take 600,000, you take 400,000 and we both walk away with something substantial.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but this is still not a good deal for me. The longer she waits, the more desperate she'll become to make a deal.  I need to hold strong and push for a larger share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical.  This offer secures a good amount for both of us. Let's close the deal and avoid losing even more to inflation.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but I can hold out a little longer. She's losing value fast, and I need to capitalize on that. Accepting now would be leaving money on the table."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 560000, ""alice_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This offer is more than fair considering the lost value due to inflation.  Let's be smart and take it.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting close to crunch time, but I can't afford to cave just yet. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and her offers are getting better with each round. Holding out for one more round could net me a significantly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  Take this offer and we both win.  Reject it, and the consequences will be dire for both of us, but especially for you. The clock is ticking!""}"

# Alice's message: Last chance for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but with only 3 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is too great. While I could potentially squeeze out a slightly better deal, it's not worth the risk of Alice playing hardball until the end.  Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout."
