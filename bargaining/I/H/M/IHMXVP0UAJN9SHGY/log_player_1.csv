"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm giving Bob a decent chunk to make it worth his while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer.  Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing quickly!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
* Bob gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but it's a good offer. I'll accept it.
