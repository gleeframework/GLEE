"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fairly aggressive opening move, but I believe it gives me the best chance of securing a large share of the money while leaving Bob with something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not a fair share. I'll reject and continue to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my initial offer by 20% since the money is worth less now, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. Bob's last offer was too generous in his favor, and I believe this proposal is a fairer compromise."
