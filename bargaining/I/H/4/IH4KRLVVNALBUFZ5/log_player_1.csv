"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor to account for the inflation disadvantage I'll face in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, taking into account that the money will be worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, while it will be worth 10% less for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less than 50, so I'll try to get more this round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 70% of the remaining amount, especially considering the inflation disadvantage I'll face in future rounds. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my share to account for the inflation disadvantage. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to Bob."

# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this round. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my share! With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to be extremely cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 80% of the remaining amount, especially considering the significant inflation disadvantage I'll face in future rounds. I'll wait for a better offer, but I'm starting to worry that I might end up with very little."

}
```
