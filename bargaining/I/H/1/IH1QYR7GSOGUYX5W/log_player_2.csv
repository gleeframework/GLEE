# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer split.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer is still good for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering Alice's gains are worth significantly less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gains, I'll make an offer that slightly favors me but still appears reasonable given the circumstances.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, but your side is losing more value each round. Let's settle on this before it gets worse for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offers have been more than fair. Accept this now, or the deal will only get worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, especially on Alice's side, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. Proceeding further might lead to diminishing returns for both of us, but more significantly for Alice, which could jeopardize the negotiations entirely.
