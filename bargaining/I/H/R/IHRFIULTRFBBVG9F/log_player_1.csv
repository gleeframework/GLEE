Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I'll take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%.  Since we're both unaware of how inflation affects the other, I'm trying to secure the most for myself while still giving Bob a small incentive to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to get more, Bob's offer is much more equitable than my previous proposal.  With the inflation affecting the value of the money, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point."
