"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a generous offer considering the inflation penalty he'll face if he rejects it. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I've slightly reduced my offer from the first round, but I'm still being fairly generous considering Bob's inflation penalty is increasing. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and settle this soon!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still hoping for a better split 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Getting impatient""
}
```

I've slightly reduced my offer again, but I'm still not willing to give Bob more than 43% of the money. With his inflation penalty increasing, I think I have the upper hand in this negotiation. Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Equal split, come on

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Not going for equal""
}
```

I've gone back to a similar offer as before, giving Bob 42% of the money. With his inflation penalty so high now, I think he'd be wise to accept this offer. I'm not going to give in to an equal split!"
