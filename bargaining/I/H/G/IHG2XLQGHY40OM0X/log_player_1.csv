{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's start with that and see how it goes. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but considering the inflation factor, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
