I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This way, I maximize my share while still giving Bob something to consider in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, this is a good deal for me in the second round.  The inflation has significantly decreased the value of my potential gains, and accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
