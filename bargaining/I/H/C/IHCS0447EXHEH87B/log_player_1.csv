# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the different inflation rates. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.
