"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. What do you think?""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, my gain of 50 is actually 95 (100 - 5% of 100).

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
