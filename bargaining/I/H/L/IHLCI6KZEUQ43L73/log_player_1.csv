Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the initial offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though the money is worth less, it's still better than waiting for the next round. I will get $4,500, and there's a risk that the money will be worth even less in the next round."
