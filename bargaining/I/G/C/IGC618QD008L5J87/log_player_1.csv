I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal. Bob is getting a much worse deal with each round, and I'm confident I can secure a more advantageous split."

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a fair split. Bob's situation is becoming increasingly desperate with each round, and this offer still puts him in a better position than he would be in if he rejects it."

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to try to push for a more equitable split."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

With only two rounds left, I'm proposing an even split. This is the most fair solution given the current circumstances. Bob is losing a substantial amount of value with each round, and an equal division is the best way to salvage something from this situation."
