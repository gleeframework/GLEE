Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me less, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct; inflation is impacting me more. However, accepting 44 at this point is a terrible deal. The longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll get as her own gains decrease. I need to hold out for a better offer."
