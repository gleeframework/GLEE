700000.0,300000.0,"I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but the inflation puts you at a bigger disadvantage with each round.  I'll take a little less than last time, and you'll still get a good chunk before it devalues further.",Alice,3,

600000.0,400000.0,"I understand the inflation is a big factor, but I believe a 40/60 split is a fairer compromise.  It allows you to get a good amount, while giving me a chance to recover some of my losses before the money becomes even less valuable.",Bob,4,
