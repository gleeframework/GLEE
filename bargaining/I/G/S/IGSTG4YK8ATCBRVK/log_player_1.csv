"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm looking for a majority stake.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split. It's fair and ensures we both benefit equally from this division. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $850,000 (5% of $900,000)
Bob gain: $500,000 (still 10% of $1,000,000)

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $500,000, which is less than what I would get in this round if I were to make a new offer. However, I'm not sure what the future offers will look like, and this is a fair split.
