"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

# Bob gain: 700000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is biting, and the money is worth less with each round. I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, but still reasonable. Here it is:

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Bob gain: 800000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth less and less with each round, and I need to be more aggressive. Here's my next offer:

I'm going back to my original offer from Round 1, but with the knowledge that the money is worth even less now. Hopefully, Bob will accept this one!"
