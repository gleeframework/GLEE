"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the inflation risk.  It's a fairer balance considering we both stand to lose value in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
