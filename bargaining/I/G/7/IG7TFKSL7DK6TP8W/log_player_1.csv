Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering you $9,000 and Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's a fair deal considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we continue."
