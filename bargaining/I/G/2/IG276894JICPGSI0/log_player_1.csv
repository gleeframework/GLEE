Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. Since I'm making the offer this round, I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to get a better deal than last time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
