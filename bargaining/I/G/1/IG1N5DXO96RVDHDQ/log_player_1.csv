"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'll try a more balanced offer this time.  I'll take 7000$ and give Bob 3000$.  Since we're both losing money due to inflation, a fairer split is likely to get us both a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the money is worth significantly less than in the first round, I am willing to accept this 50/50 split.  The risk of further rounds of inflation makes this a reasonable outcome for me."
