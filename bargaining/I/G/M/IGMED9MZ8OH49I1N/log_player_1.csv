"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the actual amounts I'd get in this round are:

* Alice gain: 400000 x 0.8 = 320,000
* Bob gain: 600,000 x 0.8 = 480,000

Considering this, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 7/3 is a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
