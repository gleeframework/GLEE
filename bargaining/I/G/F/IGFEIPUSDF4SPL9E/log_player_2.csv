"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is a fair split, I see no reason to reject it. It's a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable and equitable division of the $100. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive a guaranteed $50, rather than risking a potentially worse offer in subsequent rounds."
