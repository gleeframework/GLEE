"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after one round (100 - 20% = 80), I'll make a new offer.

{""bob_gain"": 64, ""alice_gain"": 36}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 36% less than in the first round, the effective amount is now 64% of the original value (100 - 36 = 64). Alice's offer is now:

# Bob gain: 50 * 0.64 = 32
# Alice gain: 50 * 0.64 = 32

Since the amounts are equal, I'll accept the offer to avoid further rounds.
