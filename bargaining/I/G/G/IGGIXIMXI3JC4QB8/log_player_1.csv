"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation disparity and offers a fair deal for both of us.  Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
