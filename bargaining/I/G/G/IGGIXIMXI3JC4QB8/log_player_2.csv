"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but I'm still feeling the effects of inflation. Let's compromise: I'll take 45% and you take 55%. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money. Let's end this game before it gets any more complicated. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in Round 3 presents a reasonable compromise, especially considering the impact of inflation on her potential gains. 

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice. This makes her more likely to accept a lower offer as the game progresses.
* **Fairness:** A 55/45 split is a relatively balanced outcome. While I could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee of a better offer, and the risk of further devaluation is significant for Alice. 

It's better to secure a decent share now than gamble on a potentially less favorable outcome later."
