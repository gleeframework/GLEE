"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money but leaves Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to take a small piece now rather than risk getting nothing later with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I am getting a smaller share, the inflation is making the money I would receive if I reject this offer and make a counter-proposal worth significantly less. It's better to take what I can now, even if it's not ideal."
