"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, Alice. How about this offer? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted version of your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is trying to wear me down with slight adjustments in his favor. It's important to hold strong and demonstrate that I won't accept an unfair deal, even with the inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on. This is a serious offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is increasingly hurting me. Bob needs to understand that time is running out. 
* **Show of Strength:** Offering slightly less than my last offer shows Bob I'm serious and won't be endlessly pushed around.  
* **Slight Compromise:**  While firm, I'm still offering a compromise that's better for him than my Round 3 offer, acknowledging the need to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right about time being a factor, Alice. I'm proposing we meet in the middle with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point. Bob is trying to frame ""meeting in the middle"" as a compromise, but it's based on *his* skewed offer from Round 4, not a genuinely fair split. Accepting now would set a dangerous precedent, making it seem like I'm willing to be pressured into a bad deal. The inflation hurts, but caving to this tactic will hurt more in the long run."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm standing firm. This offer is more than fair, and the clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  With time running out, I'm making a final push for a reasonable agreement. This offer is a slight concession from my Round 5 offer but still maintains a principled stance.
* **Underscoring Urgency:** I'm explicitly reminding Bob that time is running out for both of us. He needs to realize that his stubbornness could cost him everything. 
* **Projecting Confidence:** By standing firm and repeating a strong offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about my bottom line and won't be bullied into a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  Let's settle this with a slight adjustment to your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's painful to accept anything less than 50%, but with the rapidly increasing inflation, waiting any longer is too risky. This offer is barely above the 50/50 split when adjusted for inflation, and getting Bob to move even slightly in my favor is a minor victory at this stage. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time Pressure:** I only have four rounds left. While I could continue to push back, the inflation will severely erode the value of any potential gains.  
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything better, even if I reject this. He may be stubborn enough to gamble with both of our outcomes.
* **Preserving Value:** Accepting now secures me a significant sum, even though it's less than my ideal. It's better to take a smaller, guaranteed gain than risk ending up with nothing."
