"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one making the first move! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""You took a big share last round, I'll give you a bit more this time!""
