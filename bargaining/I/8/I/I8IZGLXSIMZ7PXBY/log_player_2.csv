"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share. Accept this offer and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further. There's a chance she'll offer me more, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This takes into account the fact that the money will be worth slightly less in the next round.  Let's reach a fair agreement and end this game.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a more favorable split, especially given the effects of inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, the money keeps losing value with each round. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the current situation. Let's agree and end this game.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. But I'm not going to give up my advantage yet. Let's see if you'll accept this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, I'm still aiming for a bigger share, especially with the increasing inflation.  I'll continue to negotiate in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's call it a draw and end this game. We're both losing money to inflation anyway. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to continue negotiating for a larger share, the inflation is hurting both of us significantly. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option to minimize our losses.  It's time to end this game."
