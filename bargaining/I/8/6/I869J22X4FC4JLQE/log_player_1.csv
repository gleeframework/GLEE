"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4000$ in this round is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'd actually be getting 4800$ in ""real"" terms. And Bob's gain of 6000$ is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so he'd be getting 5400$ in ""real"" terms.

I think this is a more favorable offer for me, so I'll accept it.
