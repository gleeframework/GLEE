"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, take it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less, so my gain is now 720,000. Bob's offer is still quite one-sided, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now 720,000. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's end this!""
}
