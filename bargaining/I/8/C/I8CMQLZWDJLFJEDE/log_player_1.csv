"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000. This is a very generous offer, as I believe it's fair given the inflation rates we are dealing with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While this is a less ideal outcome than my original proposal, given the inflation rates and the fact that Bob has shown he's willing to play hardball, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. I'll get $100,000, which is still a substantial amount of money."
