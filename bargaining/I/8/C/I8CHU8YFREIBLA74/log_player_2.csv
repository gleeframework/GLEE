Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we both need to compromise to get anything at all. This is my best offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:** The value of the $100 is rapidly decreasing.  Delaying further significantly hurts Bob more than Alice.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems to be anchoring around a 60/40 split in her favor.  She's unlikely to offer much better given the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer in the hopes of getting a slightly better deal in later rounds is extremely risky. If the game goes to the end, they both get nothing.

While not ideal, taking $35 (even with the inflation) is better than walking away with nothing."
