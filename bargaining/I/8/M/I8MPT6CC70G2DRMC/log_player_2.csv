Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a split, but let's be realistic. This money is losing value for you with every passing moment.  My offer is still on the table: a larger share now, or risk it dwindling further. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
