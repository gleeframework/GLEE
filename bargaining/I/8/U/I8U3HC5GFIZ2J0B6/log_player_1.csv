"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% of the total. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to try to do better in the next round."
