I'm starting with a very uneven split. I'm hoping Bob will accept it since he gets something, and if he rejects it, I'll have the advantage in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a much better deal for me than my initial offer, and the inflation is starting to take a toll. I'd rather get half now than risk getting nothing later."
