{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but 65/35 is still too much. I'm willing to offer you 55%, but I need at least 45% to make it worthwhile for me. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of you. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting longer means significantly less money even if you get a slightly better split.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the next round. She might offer even less, putting you in a worse position.
* **Present Value:** A 55/45 split is decent, and taking the money now means you secure a sizable sum."
