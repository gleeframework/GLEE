I propose to keep $90 and give $10 to Bob.  I'm taking a big share to start, but I want to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. Even though the inflation is hurting me, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering Bob $15, which is a little more than he offered me last round.  Hopefully, he'll accept, as inflation is starting to eat away at my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hurting me significantly now.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid losing more money.  While I'd prefer a better split, it's not worth risking further losses."
