Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm taking almost everything for myself, knowing that if Bob rejects, he'll have to make an offer in the next round and the value of the money will decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
