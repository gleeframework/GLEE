"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll give you a small chance to catch up! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round!

However, I'm not going to give up easily. I'll think carefully about this offer.

After considering the 5% decrease in value of my gain due to inflation, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn to make an offer again!

Considering the 5% decrease in value of my gain due to inflation, I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm being reasonable and willing to negotiate. Now it's his turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny slice 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the significant decrease in value of my gain due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round, or that I'll get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the 14.26% decrease in value of my gain due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting close to desperation, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money and make a more modest proposal. I hope Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer."
