"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my thinking. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less, he's effectively proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more skewed than I'd like.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect taking a bigger toll on the money's value, Bob's offer is actually a relatively smaller share for him compared to the previous round. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is reasonable.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
