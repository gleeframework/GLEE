"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, Bob's offer is worth 5% less than his initial proposal, but he's still taking a larger share.

I'll decide to reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still need a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. However, his offer is still not as good as my previous one, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time.

I'll decide to reject this offer as well. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a new proposal, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money continuing to lose value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make a fair deal before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal distribution of the remaining value of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
