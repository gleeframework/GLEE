"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$. This way, I'll get 600,000$, which is a good starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal for Round 2 is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob 550,000$, which is a slightly more generous offer than before, considering the reduced value of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
