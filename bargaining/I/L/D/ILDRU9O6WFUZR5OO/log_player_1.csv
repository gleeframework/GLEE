Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm passing on a friendly message to Bob."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it.

# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you in the middle this time. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll decide to accept it.
