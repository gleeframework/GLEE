"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you get 40. Let's split it fairly.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but also recognize that your share is worth more than mine. 55/45 feels reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'd like to consider the value of the money. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.8 = 44

Considering this, I think the offer is reasonable. I accept the offer.
