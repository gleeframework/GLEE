"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share this time, but I'll give you a chance to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share due to the inflation. I'll think carefully...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
