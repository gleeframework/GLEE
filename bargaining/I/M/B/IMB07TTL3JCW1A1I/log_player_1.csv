"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. I'm trying to set the bar high to see if Bob will try to negotiate or accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is a good one. I'd rather not give him 90% of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite generous to me, I'll try to counter with a more moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. This is a more balanced offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
