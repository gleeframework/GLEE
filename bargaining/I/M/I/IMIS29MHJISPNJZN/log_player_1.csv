"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority share""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a decent share, but you can't have it all! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I'm willing to give up more than half of the initial amount. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but don't expect me to give away too much more""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, but still reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a fair one, considering the situation. We're both getting an equal share of the remaining amount, which is $5,000 each. It's a decent compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation."
