"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair offer. Let's see if you'll accept this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the offer is still relatively fair.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $6,000 and we can wrap up the game!"
