Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on the inflation. This offer is a compromise, taking that into account while still being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5125,
""alice_gain"": 4875,
""message"": ""Alice, this is the same offer you just presented, but accounting for the inflation we both know is happening. It's the fairest offer I can make.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm sticking to my original offer of a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option, regardless of how many rounds we go through. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting the 50/50 split is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round that passes, the value of Bob's potential share decreases significantly due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice is Firm:** Alice seems unwilling to budge from her 50/50 stance. Continuing to reject her offer in hopes of a better deal is risky, as it could lead to Bob receiving a much smaller amount in the end.

While not ideal due to the inflation, taking the 50/50 split now ensures Bob at least receives a reasonable portion of the money."
