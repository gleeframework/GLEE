Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty uneven split. I want to keep the majority of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with a small amount. This is a risky move, but I believe it's a good strategy to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a risky game, and I'm not willing to settle for a tiny share of the money, especially with inflation affecting my gains. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm acknowledging the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I believe this will be more appealing to him, increasing the chances of ending the game and securing a good amount for myself."
