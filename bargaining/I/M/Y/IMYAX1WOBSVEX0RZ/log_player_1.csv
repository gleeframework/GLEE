Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive split in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a smaller share to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation rate means that waiting any longer risks losing a significant portion of the potential earnings.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather secure half the money than risk getting nothing."
