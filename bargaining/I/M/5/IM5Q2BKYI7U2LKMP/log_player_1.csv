"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we're facing.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. So, I'd be getting 90% of $6000, which is $5400. 

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous to him, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. Can we discuss further?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll propose a slightly more conservative split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering the decreasing value of money. Your turn again, Bob!""
}
```"
