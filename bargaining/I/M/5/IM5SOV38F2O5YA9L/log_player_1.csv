"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount. If he accepts, I'll get the remaining $900,000. The message is a bit of a warning, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting a decent offer early on!"
