"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can both end the game on a high note. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 3000 is worth 95% of 6000, which is 5700.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's a significant difference from the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 95% of what it was in Round 2, so my gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in Round 1 (95% of 95% of 6000).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 4200, and you can have 5800. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than in the first round, while still being reasonable. What do you think, Bob?"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's still a bit lower than what I was hoping for. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.
