"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob! I'm offering you $100,000 to get us going.""
}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to keep a significant amount for himself!

I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. How about we split it more evenly?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me halfway!

I'll think for a moment... 

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
