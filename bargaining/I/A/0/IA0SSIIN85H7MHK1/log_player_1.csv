"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, which seems fair and gives us a good foundation to build on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but still aiming to get a slightly larger share of the pie. Let's see if Bob bites!"
