"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40-60 split, and I think I can do better. I'll pass on this offer and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to get closer to a 50-50 split, but still slightly favoring myself since the money is worth less to Bob due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this offer is reasonable, considering the effects of inflation on Bob's gain. The 48-52 split is still close to a 50-50 split, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game."
