Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fairer starting point, as we are both negotiating. I believe this will be a more mutually beneficial agreement for us both in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 70/30 split in our favor.  While we're both losing some value to inflation, this offers a fairer balance considering the potential for future losses.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher percentage, accepting this offer ensures I get at least some money, considering the rapid inflation.  It's also a good starting point for future negotiation."
