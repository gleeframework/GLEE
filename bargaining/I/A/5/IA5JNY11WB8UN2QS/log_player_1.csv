"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a straightforward and fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in this round, I'll consider the effective value of his offer. To make it comparable to the original amount, I'll divide his gain by 0.9 (1 - 0.10).

Effective Bob gain: 600000 / 0.9 = 666,666.67

Now, I'll compare it to my gain. My gain is 400,000, which is less than the effective Bob gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. I'll give him a slightly higher share, but still keep a decent amount for myself.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for you, but I'm not giving away too much!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting fierce!

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in this round. To make it comparable to the original amount, I'll divide his gain by 0.7289 (1 - 0.271).

Effective Bob gain: 700000 / 0.7289 = 960,000

Now, I'll compare it to my gain. My gain is 300,000, which is less than the effective Bob gain.

However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to squeeze out a better deal.

Since Bob's offer was a bit too low, I'll aim to get a higher share for myself. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger bite!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in this round. To make it comparable to the original amount, I'll divide his gain by 0.59605 (1 - 0.404).

Effective Bob gain: 750000 / 0.59605 = 1,260,000

Now, I'll compare it to my gain. My gain is 250,000, which is much less than the effective Bob gain.

However, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal at this point. I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I've seen so far.
