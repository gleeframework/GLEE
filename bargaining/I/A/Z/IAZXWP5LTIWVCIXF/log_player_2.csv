"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 60-40 is a fair starting point, it doesn't account for the inflation rates. Since the money is worth more to me than Alice, I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Since the money depreciates differently for us, I'm proposing a 65-35 split.  This accounts for the inflation advantage I have.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but 65-35 is too steep. How about 55-45? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, this is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
