"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:1 ratio, giving me a slight edge to account for the diminishing value of money, but still leaving you with a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
