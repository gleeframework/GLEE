"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and I was initially offered $600,000, the equivalent value of that amount after the first round of inflation is 0.9 * 600,000 = $540,000.

In the second round, Bob is offering me $300,000, which is worth 90% of its original value, so the equivalent value is 0.9 * 300,000 = $270,000.

Since $270,000 is less than $540,000, I will reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and I was offered $270,000 in the previous round, the equivalent value of that amount after the second round of inflation is 0.9 * 270,000 = $243,000.

Considering the current value of the money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the current value of $1,000,000 and leaving 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money I would gain if I accepted Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and I was initially offered $600,000, the equivalent value of that amount after three rounds of inflation is 0.7289 * 600,000 = $437,340.

In the fourth round, Bob is offering me $450,000, which is worth 100% of its original value, so the equivalent value is 1.0 * 450,000 = $450,000.

Since $450,000 is more than $437,340, I will accept this offer.
