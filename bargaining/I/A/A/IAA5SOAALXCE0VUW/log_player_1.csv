"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. Considering the inflation, the 1000 dollars I would get in this round is equivalent to 950 dollars in the first round. I'd rather wait for a better offer.
