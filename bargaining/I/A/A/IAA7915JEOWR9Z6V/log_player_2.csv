**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very stubborn, but I need to hold firm.  While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting a 40/60 split sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. There's a real chance Alice will break and offer something better in the next couple of rounds.  The risk of getting zero is growing, but it's a calculated risk I have to take."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to move a bit. 43/57.  Don't let this opportunity slip away."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to show some flexibility to entice Alice while still aiming for a better split. This offer is a small concession from my previous position but significantly better than her repeated 40/60 proposal. I'm hoping the combination of compromise and a ticking clock will push her to accept."
