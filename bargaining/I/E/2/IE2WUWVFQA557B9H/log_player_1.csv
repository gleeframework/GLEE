Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty standard split, giving myself a large share to start.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a significant improvement from my previous proposal. I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation!"
