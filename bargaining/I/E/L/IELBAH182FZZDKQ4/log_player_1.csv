Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your starting offer was a bit too greedy, Alice. Let's meet closer to the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. The inflation hurts me more than you. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
While a 50/50 split seems fair in a regular scenario, the inflation heavily favors me in this game. Bob is getting desperate, and I can likely get a better deal if I hold out a little longer."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 625000,
""bob_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but I need to be mindful of my own losses. This offer is a compromise - it's less than my previous offer but still gives me a reasonable share.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm sticking to 50/50.  It's the only fair deal, and with each round, we both lose more. Do you want to walk away with nothing? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly fixed on the 50/50 split, and while it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing if this drags on. The inflation is starting to become significant, and waiting any longer might result in a worse outcome even if I could get Bob to agree to a slightly higher share in a later round."
