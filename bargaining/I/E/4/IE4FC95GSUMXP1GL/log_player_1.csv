"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll give you a fair deal, but don't expect me to go any higher.""
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. You can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me now!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to get the better end of the deal. I'm not interested in giving you 70% of the money. I'll do better than 50-50, but I'm not going that low.""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 70% of the money. I'll give you 45% and call it a day. Don't expect me to go any higher.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet. I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of again. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze in one last offer before the game ends.

However, I notice that his offer is actually worse than my previous offer, considering the inflation. My offer in round 3 was 550,000 for me and 450,000 for him, which is still a better deal for me considering the inflation.

I'll reject his offer and stick with my previous offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is worse than mine from last round. I'm sticking with my 55-45 split. You should have accepted it when you had the chance.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, trying to be a bit more aggressive this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any more chances to negotiate. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to accept your ultimatum. I'll make one last offer and hope you'll see sense. We can split it 50-50 and end this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a last-ditch effort to get a fair deal.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for him than my previous offer, and it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. I think it's time to accept the offer and end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, we'll split it 50-50. I'm tired of negotiating. Let's just get this over with.""
}
```"
