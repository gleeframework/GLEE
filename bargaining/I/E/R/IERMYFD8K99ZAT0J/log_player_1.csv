I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  I want to see how much Bob is willing to accept.  I figure, if he rejects this, he's probably going to counter with a more even split, which is fine.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  He offered me $100,000, but even after inflation, my offer to him of $100,000 was worth $90,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to push for a bigger share again. Bob might be getting a little nervous about the inflation, and I think he'll be more open to negotiation after rejecting my last offer.  I'm hoping he'll accept this, but I'm prepared to keep going if he doesn't."
