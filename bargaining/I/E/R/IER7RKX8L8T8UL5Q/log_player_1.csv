"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, let's split it this way""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm giving you 40% of the initial 100$. I'm hoping you'll accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so the effective value of the 30$ I would get is 28.25$. Considering Bob's offer is still a significant amount, I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30$ for me, I'll try to do better. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering you 45% of the initial 100$, which is a higher percentage than before. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!"
