Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to split the money fairly, but I'd like to see a bit more of a return for my time in this game. Let's find a compromise.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get something back for my time in this game. Let's try this split and see if we can find a better compromise in the future. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant share and avoids the risk of getting nothing due to inflation.  It's a good starting point for potential negotiation in future rounds."
