I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  I'm banking on him being happy with a small gain in this round. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not as good as my initial proposal, it's still a good deal for me given the inflation. It's better to get 5000 now than risk getting nothing at all later."
