Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting impatient, I'm getting greedy 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a game of chicken, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. However, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not a good long-term strategy. I need to show I'm willing to push this close to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'fair' is not my 'fair' 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to exploit the inflation. I need to show resolve. While the value of the deal is getting worse, accepting anything less than 50% at this stage sets a dangerous precedent for the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 49, ""alice_gain"": 51, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to accept a slight loss to end this. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out.  While I want a 50/50 split, offering Alice a tiny bit more might be enough to get her to agree.  The message is designed to convey firmness and a sense of urgency, making it clear that this is my final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the pressure is really on now.  While I'm getting a bad deal, rejecting this means we're likely heading into a scenario where I'm forced to accept even less or risk getting nothing. Taking the 45 now cuts my losses."
