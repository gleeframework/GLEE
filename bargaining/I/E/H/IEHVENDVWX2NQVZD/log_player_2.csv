Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a fairer split, reflecting my role in the negotiation process.  Let's agree and move on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50-50, considering the inflation impact on Bob's share. A fair compromise! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation makes this a decent compromise.  It's better than getting nothing in a later round."
