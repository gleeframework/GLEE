9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10% this time.  We can negotiate further in the next rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,My turn to propose something more reasonable. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. Let's split it 55/45, giving you a bigger share but still being fair.  We both have a lot to lose if we keep rejecting each other's offers.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Okay, let's meet in the middle. I'll come down a bit to 58/42. This considers the time pressure and gives us both a decent share.",Bob,4,
