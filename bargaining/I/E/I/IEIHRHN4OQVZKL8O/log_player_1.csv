I'm starting with a pretty generous offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share early on, or if he's going to try to push for a bigger share in the later rounds.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, especially since the money is worth less for him in each round. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent amount.  With each round, the money is worth less for him, so I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing than his previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, considering how much the money is worth less for him now. I'll keep rejecting his offers and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still offering a good deal to Bob. I'm hoping that the increasing inflation will make him realize that it's in his best interest to accept a deal before the money becomes worth very little for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the money is worth less for me now, I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  I think I can do better if I wait and make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share for me, but the inflation is starting to impact Bob significantly.  I'm hoping he'll realize it's better to take this offer than to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The money is worth so much less for Bob now that I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm going to keep rejecting his offers and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This round, I'm offering an even split.  Bob has been very stubborn, but the inflation is really starting to bite him.  I think he'll finally see the value in a fair deal."
