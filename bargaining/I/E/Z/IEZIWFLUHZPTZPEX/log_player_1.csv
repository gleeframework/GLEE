"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation risk. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to flip the script and offer the same split I originally proposed, but with the labels swapped.

I'll consider this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split, and I'd rather not risk further negotiations and potential future inflation."
