Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with every round, so it's best to be fair and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
