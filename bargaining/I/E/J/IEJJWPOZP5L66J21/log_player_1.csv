"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is a relatively even split, reflecting the fact that Bob's money is devalued at a higher rate than yours. I'm hoping this will make him likely to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than the one I made in the previous round, even taking inflation into account. I'll reject and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly in this round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  Since my money is devaluing at a slower rate than his, this offer is still more favorable to me than the previous one."
