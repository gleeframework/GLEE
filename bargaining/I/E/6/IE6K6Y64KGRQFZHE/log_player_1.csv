"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the money!

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the fairest way, especially since I've already proposed a more generous offer in the first round. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk going into more rounds.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than your previous offer. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, but I also don't want to risk going into more rounds. The message suggests Bob is willing to compromise, so I'll consider this offer.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
