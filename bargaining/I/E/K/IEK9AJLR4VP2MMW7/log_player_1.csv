I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. I'll take my chances with the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm going to try to compromise a bit more this round, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money. Hopefully Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before inflation eats away at his share even more."

Bob's offer is getting more and more unfair! I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal in the upcoming rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still trying to keep a significant portion of the money. Inflation is starting to become a serious factor, and I need to make sure I get something before it's too late."

Bob's offer is still too lopsided. While I'm starting to feel the pressure from inflation, I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'll keep fighting for a fairer deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

Inflation is making it more and more difficult to secure a good deal. I'm taking a bigger risk this time and offering Bob a more significant share.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate, and we can reach an agreement before the remaining rounds become too risky."
