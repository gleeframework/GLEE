"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be realistic. This is a much fairer split considering the rapid devaluation of your share with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical and split this evenly.  The longer we wait, the more we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Explanation:

While Alice's offer is still slightly in her favor due to the faster devaluation of her share, it's now reasonably close to an even split. Further delay will only hurt both players. Accepting ensures Bob a reasonable share, whereas continued negotiation risks a worse outcome as the value diminishes.
