"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This proposal gives me a slightly larger share, considering the impact of inflation on my gains in subsequent rounds if we don't reach an agreement early. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and cooperation, encouraging him to accept the offer and end the game quickly, avoiding potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness, but this is a limited opportunity, and my value decreases faster.  Let's be pragmatic. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the 20% decrease in value for me due to inflation, accepting $4000 in this round would be equivalent to accepting less than what I initially proposed for myself. Given that we're only in the second round and there are 10 more rounds to go, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable division. Additionally, Bob's message suggests he's open to pragmatism, which might allow for further discussion on the division."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet halfway on the previous offers""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, with a message suggesting we meet halfway between our previous offers. This compromise aims to acknowledge the impact of inflation on my potential gains while also showing willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable division. By meeting halfway, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's pragmatic side, as he mentioned in his previous message, and end the game with a fair division before further inflation devalues my potential share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and we both lose with every round. This offer is a good compromise considering the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the increasing pressure from inflation, accepting $4500 at this stage would mean I'm getting significantly less value than what I've previously proposed or could potentially achieve. The 48.8% decrease in value due to inflation means that the $4500 offered is worth substantially less than its face value compared to the first round. Since we're still in the early rounds and Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, I believe there's room to negotiate further to find a division that more closely aligns with my initial proposal or achieves a better balance considering the inflation impact."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm offering $5600 for myself and $4400 for Bob, with a message emphasizing the urgency and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I'm slightly adjusting my offer downwards to show flexibility while still aiming to secure a substantial share. The message aims to convey that we're reaching a critical point where further negotiations might lead to losses for both parties, hoping to persuade Bob to accept this offer and conclude the game before the value of the money decreases further.\n{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""We're running out of time; let's secure our gains""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're past the halfway point.  This offer reflects the urgency of the situation for both of us. Let's settle this now and avoid losing more. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains at this stage, the $4800 offered, although worth 67.23% less than its initial value, represents a better option than the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Bob's message emphasizes the urgency for both of us to settle, and considering we've passed the halfway point, the likelihood of negotiating a more favorable division in the remaining rounds is low. Accepting this offer ensures I secure some value rather than risking further losses due to inflation or the possibility of both of us getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
