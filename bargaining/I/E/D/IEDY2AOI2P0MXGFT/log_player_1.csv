"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 600,000$ and leave 400,000$ for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll reassess the offer. If I take 400,000$ now, it's equivalent to 500,000$ in the first round, and if I take 600,000$, it's equivalent to 720,000$ in the first round.

Considering the value has decreased, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
