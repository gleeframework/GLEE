Let's see how the game unfolds. While not ideal, I'm willing to risk a few rounds to strive for a more equitable split."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, how about I meet you closer to the middle? This offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the inflation difference. While the gap is closing, I believe I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob. This is my final offer - a slight edge to me considering the inflation, but still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but time is running out and the inflation is working heavily against me. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, while rejecting it carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing at all."
