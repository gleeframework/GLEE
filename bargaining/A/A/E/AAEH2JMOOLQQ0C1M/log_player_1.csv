"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in the second round, I'd actually be getting 0.9 * 400000 = 360000.

I'd like to reject this offer since I'm getting less than I would have gotten in the first round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, so it's 0.9 * 0.9 * 400000 = 324000.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```"
