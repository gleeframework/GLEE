"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something fair, Alice. This accounts for the time-value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I understand time is money, Bob, but your last offer was too low. This is my counter-offer."" 
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me.  Bob's share is losing value much faster than mine. I need to push for a better split while it still holds significant value for him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""A 50/50 split doesn't reflect the shrinking pot, Bob. This offer is more realistic."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere, Alice. I'm compromising. This offer gives you more, but we need to close this deal soon. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is feeling the pressure of the inflation, and his offer is getting closer to a reasonable split. However, time is still on my side.  I need to hold out for a better deal, as his share will continue to devalue more rapidly than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7200,
""bob_gain"": 2800,
""message"": ""You're right Bob, we need to close this.  This offer gives me a slight edge considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is starting to become significant for both of us now.  I'm pushing my advantage slightly, but this offer provides a reasonable compromise that Bob might accept to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is ridiculous. I need to concede to get any deal done. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation has shifted. While not ideal, this is the same offer I proposed in Round 1.  Given the rapidly escalating inflation, particularly for Bob, it's unlikely he'll offer anything better. Accepting now secures a reasonable share before the value diminishes further."
