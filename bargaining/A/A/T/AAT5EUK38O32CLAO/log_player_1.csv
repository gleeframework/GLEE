"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, my gain of $4000 in Round 2 is equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in Round 1 terms. Not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk getting a worse offer in the next round. Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to be reasonable, but still wants a good deal.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 3, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, hoping to get a better deal while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less in Round 4, I need to calculate the equivalent value in Round 1 terms:

$3500 / 0.721 = $4849.31 in Round 1 terms

Not a great deal for me, considering I was hoping for a better offer. Bob's message suggests he's not willing to give up much more, so I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking its toll!

Since the money is worth 40.95% less in Round 6, I need to calculate the equivalent value in Round 1 terms:

$3000 / 0.5915 = $5068.31 in Round 1 terms

}

$2500 / 0.4717 = $5311.59 in Round 1 terms

Not a great deal for me, considering I was hoping for a better offer. Bob's message suggests he's getting worried, but I'm not sure if he's willing to make a concession.
