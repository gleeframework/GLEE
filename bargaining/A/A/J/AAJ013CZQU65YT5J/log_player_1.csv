```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've worn me down! 50-50 it is!""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, even though it's not the best deal I could have gotten earlier. At this point, I'm just trying to get something out of the deal, and a 50-50 split seems like the best option."
