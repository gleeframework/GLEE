{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the money 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer gives me only 40% of the total amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

I'm proposing a new offer where I'll give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a fair share for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your previous offers 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The gap between our gains is getting too large, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 35% of the total amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much""}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and not giving away too much. This offer is slightly more generous than my previous one, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent gap between our gains."
