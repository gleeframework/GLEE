"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  We both need to consider the inflation, but a 70/30 split is too lopsided. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
