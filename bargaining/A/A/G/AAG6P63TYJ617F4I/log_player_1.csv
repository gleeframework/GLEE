"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. I'm keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to split the money 80/20, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a bit more than the $4,000 he offered in the previous round, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."

Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, to say the least. $1,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $10,000, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I think I can do better than this. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 48.83% of what it was in the first round.

}
```"
