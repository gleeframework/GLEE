"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, you can have a small share. Accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. The message is a straightforward one - I'm offering him a small share, but the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get a smaller share, but it's still better than nothing. Accept? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal, especially since I'm getting a significantly smaller share this round. I'll propose my own offer in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but don't expect me to be generous""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still not extremely generous. The message is a bit stern, to see if Bob will accept a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but don't think you're getting the better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to be strategic with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The split is still not favorable to me, and I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to compromise enough. I'll propose my own offer in Round 5.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still in control""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more skewed towards me, but I'm trying to convey a sense of urgency and control in the message to see if Bob will accept a slightly more favorable deal."

  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""
}

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, which is a very skewed deal in my favor. The message is a bit more aggressive, to convey that this is my last offer and I'm not willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's now or never, take this or walk away with nothing 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 91.41% less for me and 43.12% less for Bob, I'll have to make a decision.

I'll accept this offer. The split is still not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing. I'll take the $400,000 and consider it a better outcome than going home empty-handed.
