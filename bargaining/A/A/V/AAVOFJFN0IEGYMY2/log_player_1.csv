I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I figure Bob is likely to want to see if he can get a better deal, but we have a lot of rounds left to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a fair split, I'm confident I can do better than 500,000. I'm willing to play the long game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer a little bit, but still keep a large share for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
