"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.  This is my offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money decreases rapidly for both of us, but especially for me (20% per round). It's in my best interest to settle this quickly.
* **Fairness with Urgency:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. While I want a more equitable split, I'm offering a slight advantage to her to incentivize her to accept and avoid further depreciation. 
* **Strong Message:**  My message aims to convey a sense of urgency and finality. I'm showing flexibility by offering more than a 50/50 split, but I'm also signaling that I'm serious about getting a decent share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. Her offer is only marginally better than her first, and the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. I need to push for a more significant shift in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and we're both losing money.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Stand:** This is getting critical. Another round means another big loss in value. It's time to lay down the law with a strong, but hopefully tempting offer.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer to show some flexibility, but not by much. Alice needs to realize I'm serious.
* **Ultimatum:** The ""take it or leave it"" message is a calculated risk. It might push Alice to accept out of fear of losing even more in the next round. However, it could backfire if she calls my bluff. It's a gamble, but at this point, I need to force a decision."
