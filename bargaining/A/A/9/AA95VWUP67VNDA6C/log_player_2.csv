I'm going to try and get a better deal!"

Let's split it evenly. I don't know how inflation will affect us both, so this seems like the fairest option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. Even though inflation is affecting Alice, I'm going to try to hold out for something closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try to increase my share slightly, but I want to keep things relatively fair given the inflation that's affecting Alice."
