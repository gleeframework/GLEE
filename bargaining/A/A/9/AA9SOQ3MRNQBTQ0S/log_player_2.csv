Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said your last offer was final, but I'm giving you one more chance 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best course of action, even though it's a terrible offer from Bob's perspective. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is severe. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse offer from Alice as the value of Bob's potential share diminishes.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Offer:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. She's clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to her advantage.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting a small amount is better than risking getting nothing at all if the game continues and the value depreciates further."
