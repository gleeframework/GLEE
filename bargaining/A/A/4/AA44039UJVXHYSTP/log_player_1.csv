I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot less generous than mine, but it is still a 50/50 split, and I know inflation will make each round worse for me.  However, I think I can do better if I hold out.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to try to increase my share a bit more this round, but still offer Bob a decent amount to incentivize him to accept. Inflation is making the situation more difficult, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with his offer, but it's still too low for me. I'm feeling the effects of inflation, but I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue to hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still feeling the pressure of inflation, but I need to get a better deal than Bob's last offer.  I'm offering a lower share to Bob than my previous offer, but it's still more than his last one. Let's see if he'll take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting very risky.  Inflation is hitting me hard, but Bob's offer is getting more and more favorable to him.  It's tempting to accept, but I think I can still get a better deal if I hold out for one more round.  If he rejects my next offer, he'll be the one feeling the most pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm taking a small hit due to inflation, but I'm offering Bob a decent share, considering the circumstances.  He's already losing a significant amount to inflation, and if he rejects this, he risks losing even more in the next round.  I think he'll come to his senses and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting extremely risky.  Inflation is severely impacting my gains, and Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable.  However, I don't have any leverage left.  He's likely to propose an even worse offer for me in the next round, and I'm afraid of losing even more money.  It's time to cut my losses and accept this offer."
