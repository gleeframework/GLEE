"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still a 60/40 split, it's actually a worse deal for me than the 50/50 split I initially proposed. However, I don't have any information about the inflation rate affecting Bob's gain, so I'll have to make a decision based on the numbers I have.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gain, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55/45 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. Considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain by 27.1% from the original amount, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, since Bob's offer is still a 50/50 split, it's actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, despite the reduced value of my gain. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
