# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me, and I need to be strategic.

I'll think for a moment... Considering the aggressive offer, I'd rather not give up 40, but I also don't want to risk going into the next round with a lower value of money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
