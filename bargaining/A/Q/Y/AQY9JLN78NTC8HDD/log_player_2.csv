# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 10% and let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal. Alice is being too greedy, and I'm willing to take a chance to see if I can get more. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer because I think it's a reasonable and fair split. I'm willing to give Alice a significant portion of the money, but I also want to make sure I get a good share. By framing it as a compromise, I'm hoping Alice will see it as a reasonable offer and accept it."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55-45, and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I still think I can get a better deal. While Alice is willing to compromise, the split is still not in my favor. I'm willing to take a chance to see if I can get an even split or something closer to my previous offer. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer because I think an even split is the fairest possible outcome. By offering 50-50, I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount of money and end the game on a positive note."
