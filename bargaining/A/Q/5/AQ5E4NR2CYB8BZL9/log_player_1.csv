Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you 4500, which is more than you got in the last round. Let's split it fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what I received in the last round, it's still less than I initially proposed. I know the inflation is affecting the value of the money, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal. I believe I can get a higher share, especially since we have 10 more rounds to go."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
