"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd get $60 * 0.95 = $57.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to settle for a 60/40 split, but it's a good offer considering the circumstances. I'll decide to accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
