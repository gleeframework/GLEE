"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more advantageous offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly larger share for myself, hoping Bob will accept and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are biting!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit too skewed towards him, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values. I'll accept this offer to get some money now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
