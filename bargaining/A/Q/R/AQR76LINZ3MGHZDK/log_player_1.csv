"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and keep 90%""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 240,000 in the first round's money. And Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 630,000 in the first round's money.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but not as big as you wanted""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation:

My gain of 200,000 is worth 65,600 in the first round's money (since 100,000 / 1.5288 = 65,600).

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
