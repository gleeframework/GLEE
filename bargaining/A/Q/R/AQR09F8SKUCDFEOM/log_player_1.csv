"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would receive $5,000 and Bob would receive $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think it's unfair. I was willing to split it 50/50 initially, and now Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."

I'm not happy with this offer at all! Bob is trying to take a huge share, and I'm only getting a tiny fraction. I think I can do better than this. I'd like to make another proposal to try to get a more reasonable deal."
