"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a strong opening move, aiming to secure a significant portion of the money. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Due to inflation, the longer the game goes on, the less the money will be worth.  It's in my best interest to settle quickly.
* **Psychology:** The message is crafted to appear reasonable while subtly putting pressure on Bob. He might feel this is a good deal compared to risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slightly better than what I would have gotten in Round 1 after inflation. However, it's not enough of an improvement for me to accept. My starting offer was strong, and I'm willing to leverage the time pressure to try and get closer to a 60/40 split. Bob's willingness to move towards a more even split suggests he's feeling the pressure of inflation too."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 583200,
""bob_gain"": 416800,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I am slightly lowering my demand, but still aiming for a significantly larger share.  The offer is calculated based on the decreasing value of the money: 
    * My Round 2 goal was approximately 600,000. Adjusting for the 20% inflation, this round's offer represents that target (600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000 real value).
    *  Bob's Round 2 offer was 450,000. Adjusting for 10% inflation, this offer is a slight improvement for him (450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000 real value).
* **Time Pressure:** The message reinforces the idea that delaying is costly for both of us. Bob is likely to feel the pressure to accept before the value of the money erodes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share due to inflation differences. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Shift:** Bob is now acknowledging the impact of the differing inflation rates and offering a larger share to me. 
* **Meeting Expectations:** This offer, while not ideal, meets my adjusted expectations for this stage of the game.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out longer could potentially yield a slightly better result, but there's also the risk Bob becomes less willing to negotiate as the pot shrinks. Accepting now secures a reasonable outcome."
