"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a fair split.

I'll think about it for a moment... Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'd like to take a bit more to compensate for the inflation. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
