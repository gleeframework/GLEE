"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer aims to provide a significant portion of the funds for you in the first round, considering the potential inflation in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is generous in the first round,  it's important to consider the potential for significant inflation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counter-proposal in the next round, potentially securing a larger share of the remaining money after inflation takes effect."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
