"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too one-sided for my liking. I'm willing to be generous, but this time it's my turn to get a slightly better deal. How about a 52/48 split in my favor?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** It's crucial to make a counter-offer quickly.  The longer we wait, the less the money is worth. My potential gains decrease by 20% each round, while Alice's only decrease by 10%.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I need to assert my position and aim for a more favorable outcome than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Appearance of Fairness:** Offering a slight advantage to myself (52/48) might seem more reasonable to Alice than demanding a drastically different split right away. This could increase the chances of her accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's split it 55/45, with a slight advantage to me this time.  We can get this done quickly and avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this goes on, the less we both get. A 45/55 split is significantly better than what I was offered in Round 1 (40/60), even with the inflation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the next round. Alice might be even less willing to compromise, and the inflation will further erode the value. 
* **Realistic Expectations:** While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is within the realm of acceptable outcomes at this point in the game."
