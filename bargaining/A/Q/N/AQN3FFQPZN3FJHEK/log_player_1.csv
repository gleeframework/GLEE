"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate later""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equal. I'm willing to take a bigger share this round, but I think we can find a better solution for both of us later on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 40% of the original $100, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 36% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer yet. I'll reject it for now and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll have to be careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, we can adjust later""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an equal split of $50, hoping that we can find a better solution for both of us in future rounds."
