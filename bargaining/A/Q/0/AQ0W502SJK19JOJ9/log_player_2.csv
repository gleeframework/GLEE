"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60/40. I'll take the bigger share since I made the first offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation for Alice, she's feeling the pressure to make a deal more than I am at this stage."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is definitely feeling the heat from the inflation, but she's trying to anchor the negotiation around a higher split in her favor.  I need to hold firm a bit longer to see if I can get a more equitable split."
