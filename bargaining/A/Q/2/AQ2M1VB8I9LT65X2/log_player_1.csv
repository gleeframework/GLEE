"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars and keeping 600,000 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 600,000 dollars I would gain in the previous round is now worth 600,000 * 0.9 = 540,000 dollars.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. Since the money is now worth less, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation, the 600,000 dollars I would gain in the previous round is now worth 540,000 dollars. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars and keeping 550,000 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I would gain in the previous round. Since the money is worth 10% less each round, and there are 3 rounds that have passed, the value of the money is (0.9)^3 = 0.729. So, the 600,000 dollars I would gain in the first round is now worth 600,000 * 0.729 = 437,400 dollars.

Now, considering the offer from Bob, I'll calculate the value of the money he's offering. The 600,000 dollars he would gain in the first round is now worth 600,000 * 0.729 = 437,400 dollars. His offer is 475,000 dollars, which is more than that. I'll accept the offer.
