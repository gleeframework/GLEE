"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that the offer is reasonable and should be accepted to avoid further loss of value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair, but I believe my contributions deserve a slightly larger share.  This offer is still fair and leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I believe my initial proposal was already a compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my share from the initial proposal to meet Bob halfway, considering his request for a larger share. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and we're both losing money with each refusal. I propose we meet in the middle to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Bob's offer is closer to a middle ground, I still believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal. Considering the inflation, I'd like to try to get a bit more in the next round, as the difference is still relatively small, and the loss due to inflation might be worth the risk of negotiating further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Split the difference""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to find a middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous one, suggesting we split the difference to reach a compromise. This way, both of us make a slight concession, and we can finalize the agreement before the value of the money decreases further due to inflation."
