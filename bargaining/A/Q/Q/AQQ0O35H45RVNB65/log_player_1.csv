"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, let's split it 90-10""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $475,000 (95% of $500,000). This is a good deal for me, considering I was initially offered $900,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
