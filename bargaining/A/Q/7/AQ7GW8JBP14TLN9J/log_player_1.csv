"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Now it's my turn to be generous. I hope you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be generous, but I'm not buying it!

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has hit again, and my potential gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair offer, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the last chance for you to get anything. My offer is final. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a last-ditch effort to get the better deal.

Considering the significant drop in value due to inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, it's still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 200,000. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing.""
}
```"
