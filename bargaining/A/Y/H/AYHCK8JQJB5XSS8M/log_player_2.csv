"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round, she may be willing to offer me more to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account that the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round. By offering her 40, I'm hoping she'll consider it a good deal, given that the value of the money will continue to decrease for her if we don't reach an agreement soon."
