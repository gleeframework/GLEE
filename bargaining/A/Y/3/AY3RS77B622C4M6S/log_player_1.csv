"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my calculation. In the first round, I would have gained 6000 dollars, which is worth 9,000 dollars in the second round (due to 10% inflation).

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
