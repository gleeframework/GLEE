"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started, I'll give you a good deal!""
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can start the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have gotten a better deal in round 1, think twice before rejecting! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to rub it in, but I'm not falling for it.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the real value of the offer.

After some thought, I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of chances, Bob!""

# Alice gain: 850000 
# Bob gain: 150000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I need to be strategic. Bob's offer is still a decent one, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.
