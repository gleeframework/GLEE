"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small share, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even taking inflation into account. I'm confident I can get a better deal if we proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a significant amount. I hope this shows I'm willing to compromise, and he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the offer is significantly less than what I hoped for, I need to consider the inflation rate and the fact that Bob has the power to make the next offer.  The next round might be even worse for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  I'll accept this offer to secure some of the money."
