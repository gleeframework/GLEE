"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less in each round), I'll aim for a higher share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast for me! With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, I need to be cautious. However, this offer is a bit better than the previous one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
