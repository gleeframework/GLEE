Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an even split just yet, especially since I know that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
