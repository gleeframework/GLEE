Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but still room to negotiate 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, time is working against Bob due to inflation.  He needs to push for a better deal quickly or risk getting even less in later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, reconsider your stance 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While not ideal, Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains. Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a reasonable sum considering the circumstances.  Rejecting it risks even worse offers in future rounds as inflation eats further into Bob's potential earnings, with a very real chance of getting nothing if they don't reach an agreement."
