"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You get 10% of the money. Accept?""
}
```

This offer is a generous one, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going to the 12th round and getting nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.
