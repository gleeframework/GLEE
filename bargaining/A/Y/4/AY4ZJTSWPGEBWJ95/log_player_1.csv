"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation factor.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable considering the initial value of the money and the fact that Bob's money will be worth 20% less in each subsequent round."
