Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair.  It acknowledges your initial proposal, but also reflects the fact that I'm taking on the risk of rejection in this round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's previous proposal, I propose a 55/45 split. This maintains a reasonable gap while acknowledging the diminishing value of the currency. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
