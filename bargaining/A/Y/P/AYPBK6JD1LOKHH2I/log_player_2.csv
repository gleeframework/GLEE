"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm aiming for a better deal, Bob.  Time is money, and it's losing value for you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my initial offer. Inflation is working against you, not me. It's a good deal for you if you consider the lost value in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, it's better to take a less-than-ideal deal.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My potential gains are shrinking every round. Accepting $40 now is better than risking even less later.
* **Alice's Stance:** She seems unwilling to budge from her initial offer. Holding out might lead to me getting even less in the end. 

It's a tough call, but in a game of diminishing returns, sometimes you need to cut your losses."
