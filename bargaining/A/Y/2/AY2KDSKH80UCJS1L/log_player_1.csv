"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the $10,000 now, or we can play another round and risk losing 10% of our potential earnings due to inflation.""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair share of the money upfront, and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this time.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement now and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to calculate the actual value of the offer.

Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and the first round's gain was $6000, my gain in the second round would be $6000 * 0.9 = $5400.

However, according to Bob's offer, my gain would be $4000, which is less than the adjusted value of $5400.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation risk. Let's split the difference and avoid further losses.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the continued inflation, and I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share than Bob's previous offer."
