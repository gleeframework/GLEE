"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiation.""
}
```

I'm making a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is fairer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for me. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60/40, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.
