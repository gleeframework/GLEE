"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $200,000. I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me 20% last round, I'll give you 40% this time 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth 80% of $400,000, which is $320,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, so my gain will be worth 40% of my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a significant majority this time. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 68% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $680,000. I'll take the remaining $320,000."
