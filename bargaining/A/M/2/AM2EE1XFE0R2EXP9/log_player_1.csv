"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm taking the vast majority of the money. This is a risky move, but Bob has to accept if he wants any money at all. If he rejects, he'll have to propose in the next round, and the money will be worth less for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is much less favorable to me, I should accept it. If I reject, the money will be worth less for me in the next round, and Bob's offer will likely become even less favorable. This is a compromise that guarantees me a decent amount of money."
