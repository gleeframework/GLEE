"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm looking forward to seeing Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair start 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $2000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $1900.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
