"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 999,999 to 1 split in my favor. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to maximize my share while still offering Bob something.  Let's see if he's willing to accept such a lopsided deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear Bob is determined to get the majority. With each round, my share will shrink due to inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, even if it's a small amount."
