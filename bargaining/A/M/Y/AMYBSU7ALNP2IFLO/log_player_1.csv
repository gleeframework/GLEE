I'm going to take a very large share of the money. It's risky, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  Even though it's a huge loss for me, I'm not going to be taken advantage of like that. I know the inflation is hurting me, but I can still get a decent amount in the later rounds if I keep playing.  I'm not giving up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to make a more reasonable offer to keep Bob from accepting the next one.  Let's hope for a fair outcome."
