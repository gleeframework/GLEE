"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my initial offer so quickly.

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'm not too thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
