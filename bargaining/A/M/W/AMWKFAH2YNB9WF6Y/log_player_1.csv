"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money ($800,000) and Bob gets 20% ($200,000)."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being generous! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
