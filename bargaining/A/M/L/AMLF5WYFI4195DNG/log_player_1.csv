"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider a slight bias towards me if you're not comfortable with equal shares. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
