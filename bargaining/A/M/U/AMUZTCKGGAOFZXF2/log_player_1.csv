"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. After all, we're both losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to flip the script on me.

I'll reject this offer. The math still doesn't add up in my favor, and I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal. I'll wait for a better offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and my share is worth even less now.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 45/55 in your favor, but I need to get a better deal to make it worth my while.""
