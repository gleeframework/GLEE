"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time.  We can work out a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With 20% inflation, I'd rather try to get a better deal than accept this uneven split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split this time. We both deserve a fair share!""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll try to negotiate a more even split, taking into account that the money is still worth a significant amount. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in compromising and avoiding further inflation. Fingers crossed!"
