Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 60/40.  This is a fair split considering the inflation and the limited time.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation impacting her gains. I believe I have leverage to negotiate for a better deal in the coming rounds."
