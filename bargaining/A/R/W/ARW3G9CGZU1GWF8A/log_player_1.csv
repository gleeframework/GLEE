"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving Bob with $4,000. My message to Bob is a friendly and optimistic one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I think a 60-40 split in my favor is a fair start, given that you got the better end of the deal last time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad move by Bob!

Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather not take a 40% share, especially since it's worth less than it was in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the original offer. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give myself a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for compromise. My message to Bob is a conciliatory one, hoping to find common ground."
