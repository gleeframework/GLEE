I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I figure this will get him to accept quickly and we both get some money.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm going to reject this offer.  I know I can do better. He's just trying to take advantage of the inflation. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but I'm still giving Bob a decent share. Hopefully, he'll realize that if we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting really greedy. I'm going to reject this offer.  He's taking advantage of the inflation too much, and I know I can get a better deal. I'm not going to let him push me around."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try offering Bob a slightly smaller portion again, but I'm still giving him a decent share. I'm hoping he'll start to realize that we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still being stubborn. He's taking advantage of the inflation, and he's trying to get the most for himself. I'm not going to let him do that. I know I can get a better deal if I hold out a little longer. This is starting to get ridiculous."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. I think Bob needs to start realizing that he's not going to get everything. If we keep rejecting each other, we're both going to lose a lot of money. It's time for him to make some concessions!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too high. He's not understanding the gravity of the situation. We're losing so much money with each passing round.  I'm not going to accept this. He needs to come down on his offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to try offering Bob an even split. This is probably my last chance to get anything at all. I'm hoping he'll see that we're both going to end up with nothing if we don't reach a compromise. I'm willing to give him a 50/50 split now, but I don't think he's going to be happy with it."
