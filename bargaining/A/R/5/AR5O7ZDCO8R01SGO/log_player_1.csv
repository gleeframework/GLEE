"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###  \n\nI'll take $60 and Bob can have $40. This seems like a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further inflation. The message is a gentle nudge, encouraging Bob to see this as a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn - how about this slightly more balanced split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, even though the money is worth less now due to inflation, accepting $45 (which is effectively less than the original $45 due to the 20% decrease in value) seems less favorable than trying to negotiate for a better split in the next round. I'm hoping that by proceeding, I can still achieve a more advantageous division despite the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle now that the money's worth less for both of us.""}\n\n### \n\nGiven the effects of inflation, I've adjusted my offer to take $57 and give Bob $43. This proposal aims to find a middle ground, acknowledging that the money's value is decreasing for both of us but at different rates. The message highlights the shared impact of inflation to persuade Bob into accepting this slightly more balanced offer, especially since the value of the money will continue to decrease if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. It's a 50/50 split or nothing. Take it or leave it - we're both losing money! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, a 50/50 split at this point seems like the most reasonable option. The money is now worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob compared to the first round, making every dollar count even more. Given Bob's firm stance and the decreasing value of the money, accepting this offer seems like the best decision to avoid further losses."
