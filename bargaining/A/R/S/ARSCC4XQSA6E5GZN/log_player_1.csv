"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for haggling""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, so the actual amount I would gain is 3000 * 0.8 = 2400.

I'm not too thrilled about the majority going to Bob, but I'll consider the offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, so the actual amount I would gain is 2400 * 0.8 = 1920.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting a better deal by waiting, I'm taking more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less than the first round, so the actual amount I would gain is 2000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 1035.2.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm starting to run out of options. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, but I'm not happy about it."
