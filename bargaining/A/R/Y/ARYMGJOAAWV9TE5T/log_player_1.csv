"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits.

Since my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the effective value of my gain is 80% of the original amount.

In this case, I'll choose to reject the offer, as I'd like to aim for a higher share of the original amount.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll calculate the effective value of my gain, considering the cumulative inflation.

Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds, and then 48.8% less than that, the effective value of my gain would be 40% * 51.2% = 20.48% of the original amount.

In this case, I'll choose to accept the offer, as it's a decent share of the remaining value.
