"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a 45% share of the original $1,000,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best idea, considering the initial offer was already skewed towards Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

```

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my original target. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up that extra $20,000.

I'll think carefully before making a decision.
