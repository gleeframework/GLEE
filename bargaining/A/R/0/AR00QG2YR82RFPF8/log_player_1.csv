"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $320,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
