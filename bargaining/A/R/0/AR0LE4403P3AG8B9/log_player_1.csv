"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k and keep 600k for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $570,000 (95% of $600,000)
* Bob gain: $700,000 (still 700,000)

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
