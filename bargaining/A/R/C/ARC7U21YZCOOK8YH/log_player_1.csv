"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a slightly more favorable split for me, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again. I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer to account for the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the rapid inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800
}
```

I'm taking a bit more, but I think it's necessary to account for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value at an alarming rate!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll think carefully about this offer. With the current inflation rate, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $4000 / 0.591 (1 - 0.4095) ≈ $6,774
Bob gain: $6000 / 0.591 ≈ $10,143

In reality, Bob's offer is still quite favorable to him, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again. I'll have to be even more aggressive in my next offer to account for the extreme inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the extreme inflation, I'll make a very aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm taking a large share, but I think it's necessary to account for the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value at an incredible rate!

Considering the extreme inflation, I'll calculate the actual values:

Alice gain: $3000 / 0.475 (1 - 0.52217) ≈ $6,316
Bob gain: $7000 / 0.475 ≈ $14,737

In reality, Bob's offer is still quite favorable to him, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again. I'll have to be extremely aggressive in my next offer to account for the catastrophic inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation spiraling out of control, I'll make a very, very aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm taking almost the entire amount, but I think it's necessary to account for the almost complete devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is almost worthless!

Considering the extreme inflation, I'll calculate the actual values:

Alice gain: $2000 / 0.385 (1 - 0.6126) ≈ $5,193
Bob gain: $8000 / 0.385 ≈ $20,819

In reality, Bob's offer is still quite favorable to him, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again. I'll make one final, desperate offer to try to salvage something from this inflationary disaster."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money almost completely devalued, I'll make a final, extreme offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 10000,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}
```

I'm taking everything, but I think it's the only way to salvage anything from this inflationary disaster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is essentially worthless at this point.

Considering the extreme inflation, I'll calculate the actual values:

Alice gain: $1000 / 0.315 (1 - 0.6862) ≈ $3,175
Bob gain: $9000 / 0.315 ≈ $28,571

In reality, Bob's offer is still quite favorable to him, but I have no other choice. I'll accept it, as it's the last chance to salvage some value from this inflationary disaster.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's over."
