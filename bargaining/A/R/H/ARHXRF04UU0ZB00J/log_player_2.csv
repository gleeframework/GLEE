"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority but leave you with a little something. We can work out a better deal in the future if you want to play nice. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the small gain now, it's better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round. The inflation will be a factor in the following rounds, so rejecting now might lead to a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. We both get half, and we don't have to worry about inflation.""
