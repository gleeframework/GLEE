"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your turn to be fair, let's close this deal quickly!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  It's crucial to end the game quickly due to the high inflation rate affecting both players.  
* **Fairness Appeal:** Offering Alice slightly more than what she would have gotten in the next round (6000 * 0.9 = 5400) might entice her to accept.
* **Bob's Advantage:** While seemingly generous, Bob benefits from securing a deal now before inflation further diminishes the value of his potential earnings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet halfway! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money is rapidly losing value. Waiting another round could significantly hurt both players, but especially Bob due to the higher inflation rate he faces.
* **Marginal Gains:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer gives Bob 4200. Rejecting it and aiming for a slightly better deal in the next round is very risky. The potential gain is small compared to the potential loss through inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice's message and offer suggest she might be more persistent and less likely to make a significantly better offer in the next round."
