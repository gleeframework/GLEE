"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer heavily favors Alice. While it might seem like a decent starting point, I'm willing to gamble that I can negotiate a better deal in later rounds, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. How about a 55/45 split? It's a good deal considering the inflation working against me more."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but my previous offer was already generous. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. Alice is correct that her offer is generous considering the inflation, and it's clear she's aware of the pressure it puts on me. However, accepting a 45/55 split at round 3 still feels premature. I'm willing to risk a couple more rounds to see if I can nudge the deal slightly more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This ensures we both benefit equally before inflation eats away at the value further. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

We're getting into crunch time, and I need to apply more pressure.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and framing it as my final offer might push Alice to accept before the money is worth even less."
