"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share, but I'll give Bob something to make him think about accepting it in the first round.  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While Bob is offering a lot more than in the last round, my share is still very low. I'm going to try and get a bigger slice of the pie in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly this time.  Since Bob is likely to be more sensitive to inflation than I am, I'm going to make a more reasonable offer that gives him a larger share, but still gives me a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  The money is worth significantly less than in the first round due to inflation. Bob's offer is still quite high, but I'm willing to take my chances in the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly again, recognizing that Bob is facing even more inflation than I am. I'm hoping that this will be attractive enough for him to accept, as the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  The money is worth a lot less now due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still pretty good for me, especially considering how much his gains are being impacted. It's time to take what I can get before things get worse."
