Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money 55/45 since we both face inflation risk. This way we both get a good share while acknowledging the potential for value loss. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
