"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: 560,000 (70% of 800,000)
Bob's gain: 475,000 (30% of 1,600,000)

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have 500,000, which is more than my effective gain from the first round, but less than my effective gain from the second round. I'll accept this offer.
