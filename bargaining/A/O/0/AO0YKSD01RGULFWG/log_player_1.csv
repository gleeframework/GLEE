}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"

# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a slightly larger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I'll reject this offer for now and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share in the next round. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You took 60 last round, I'll take 55 this time. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping Bob will consider it a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but still a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering the decreasing value of money and Bob's offer, I'll accept this offer for now. It's a relatively small difference, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round.
