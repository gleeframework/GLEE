"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give you the majority! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's the best option. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the long-term effects of inflation. If I accept this offer, I'll get 30 dollars now, but it will be worth less in the future due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! 60/40 is a fair split.""

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to drive a harder bargain. Considering the inflation rate, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less. I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential risks of waiting for a better deal.
