"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair split, no haggling 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my potential gain is now $56 (70 * 0.8).

I don't think a 50-50 split is a bad deal, especially since it's a straightforward and fair proposal. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
