Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, 100,000 is too low for a million dollar split. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest outcome, and I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation."
