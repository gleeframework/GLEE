"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and since I get to propose first, I'm taking a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While it's not the best deal I've had, I think it's a fair split, and I'd rather secure 500,000 now than risk getting nothing at all.  The inflation is a real concern, and I don't want to push my luck too much."
