"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start with a fresh slate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I need to be more cautious with my decision. Bob's offer is 50/50, which is a fair split, but I'm not sure if I should take it. I'd like to propose an alternative.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is starting to bite! Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I need to be more careful with my decisions now. Bob's offer is a 55/45 split, which is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, considering the reduced value of the money. I think I'll accept this offer.
