"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 10% less, so I need to adjust my strategy accordingly. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the loss in purchasing power. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share this time, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money by 27.1% since the first round, I need to be very careful with my decisions. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk waiting for a better deal that may not come.
