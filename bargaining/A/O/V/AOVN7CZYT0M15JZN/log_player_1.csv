"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'm effectively getting $4,000 (60% of $6,667). And Bob's offer is $5,000, which is 100% of $5,000.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Bob $4,500, and I'll take $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money in this round.

Since the money is worth 20% less each round, and there have been 3 rounds, the money is worth 0.8^3 = 0.512 of its original value. So, the original $10,000 is now worth $5,120.

Bob's offer is $4,800 for me, and $5,200 for him. This is a total of $10,000, so it's a fair split.

I'll accept this offer.
