7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also giving Alice a larger portion.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution considering the inflation will be 10% higher in the next round if we don't come to an agreement.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Considering the inflation effect, I propose a 52.5/47.5 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a fair share for both of us while adjusting for the decrease in value due to inflation.",Alice,3,
