"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly nudge to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer and avoid further rounds, which would lead to a decrease in the value of the money due to inflation.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is diminishing quickly, let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation, I'm willing to take that risk to try to get a larger share. Additionally, Bob's message seems to be trying to pressure me into accepting a less favorable offer, which makes me more inclined to reject it. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Don't be greedy""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 52-48 split in my favor. Although the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split. My message ""Don't be greedy"" is a warning to Bob that he shouldn't try to take too much, as I'm willing to continue negotiating and potentially end up with a better deal.\n\nYour turn!"
