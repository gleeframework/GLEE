Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
