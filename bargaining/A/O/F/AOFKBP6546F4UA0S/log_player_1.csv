"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a bit more, huh?

I'll consider his proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting too greedy, Bob! I'm not willing to give you 60% of the total.""
}
```

I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than last time. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to push for a larger share.

Considering the effect of inflation, I'll evaluate his new proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still being too greedy, Bob! I'm not willing to give you 70% of the total. I'll try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'll reject his offer and make another counter-proposal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a final push for a large share.

Considering the significant effect of inflation, I'll evaluate his last offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""This is a very uneven split, Bob. I'm not willing to accept a 4:1 ratio. I'll try to negotiate further.""
}
```

Considering the extreme effect of inflation, I'll evaluate his last offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""This is an extremely uneven split, Bob. I'm not willing to accept a 9:1 ratio. I'd rather risk going to the next round than accept this.""
}
