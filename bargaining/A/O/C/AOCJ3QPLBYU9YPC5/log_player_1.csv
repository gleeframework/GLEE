"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering we're starting with a large sum of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more generous offer, considering the initial proposal was a bit one-sided 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but considering Bob's initial offer was 40-60, I suppose this is a slightly more generous offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
