"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep 6000 dollars for myself and give Bob 4000 dollars.  This is a fair starting point, and hopefully, we can settle this quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is better than the previous one, and there's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to make another offer that's more beneficial to me."
