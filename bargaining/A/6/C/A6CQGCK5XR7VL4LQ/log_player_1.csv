"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share this round, but I think 60:40 is a fair split given the inflation rate. It's a compromise that still benefits me more, but it's a better deal than your initial 3:1 offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
