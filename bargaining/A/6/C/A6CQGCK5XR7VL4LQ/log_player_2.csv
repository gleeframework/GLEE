"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decrease in value with each round, I propose we split the $100 in a 3:1 ratio. This offers a fair distribution given the diminishing worth of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share this round, but I think 60:40 is a fair split given the inflation rate. It's a compromise that still benefits me more, but it's a better deal than your initial 3:1 offer.""}"
