"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I figure it's a good starting point, and I want to see if he's willing to accept a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not satisfied with this offer. Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a deal that's so heavily skewed in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still going to hold out for a fair deal. I'm offering Bob $150,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. This should be enough to incentivize him to accept, as he'll still be getting a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more greedy with each round! I'm not going to accept an offer that gives him such a large percentage of the money, especially when inflation is eating away at his gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still holding out for a fair deal, but I'm willing to give Bob a little more this time. Inflation is starting to become a factor, so I need to find a balance between what I'm willing to accept and what I need to avoid losing too much. I'm hoping that this offer will convince Bob to accept and end this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting ridiculous! Inflation is hurting Bob significantly now, and yet he's still trying to grab a larger portion of the money. I'm not going to give in to his greed. I'm still confident we can find a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. Inflation is hitting Bob hard, but I also need to get a fair share. This offer gives him a decent chunk, and hopefully, he'll realize that it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it pains me to accept such a low offer, I realize that inflation is hitting Bob incredibly hard at this point.  There's a real risk of both of us getting nothing, and accepting a 50/50 split is better than ending up with nothing."
