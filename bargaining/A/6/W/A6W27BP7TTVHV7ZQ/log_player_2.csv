**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that inflation hurts me more than her.  While the deal is getting slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the threat of getting $0 looms larger."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be real.  50/50 is the fairest split. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a fair split. By now, Alice should understand that I'm not going to accept an unfair deal just because of the inflation pressure.  This offer is firm and gives her a chance to walk away with a reasonable amount."
