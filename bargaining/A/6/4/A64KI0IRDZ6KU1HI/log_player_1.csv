"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth less now. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, so I need to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards him. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less after the second round, the total amount is now $9,000. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation""
}
