Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to make a small concession, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my larger inflation rate, but her offer is barely budging. Holding out a bit longer might push her to make a more substantial concession, even with the inflation working against me."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to a deal!  I've come up a bit, let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Alice's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Inflation reminder:** Highlighting the shrinking pot encourages a quicker agreement. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a collaborative atmosphere is more likely to lead to a deal than an adversarial one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair compromise. Don't let the money lose more value, let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally moved significantly from her initial offer, and this offer is quite close to my last proposal. While ideally, I'd want a slightly larger share, the increasing inflation makes it too risky to push further. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount, even with the losses from inflation."
