"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and close the deal now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be real, I'll take a small hit to end this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  50/50 is the only fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Every round you wait, you lose more. Take this and run! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is mounting, accepting a 35/65 split in Alice's favor is a terrible deal for me.  I need to try and push Alice towards a more even split. There's still a significant amount of money ""on the table"" even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my last offer. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, I need to project firmness. Offering 45/55 is still better than what I'd get if I keep rejecting and reach the later rounds with even harsher inflation. This bluff might push Alice to concede, as she knows waiting longer might not yield a much better result for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share, take this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but 28/72 is simply unacceptable. Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanic. I need to show I'm willing to walk away, hoping she'll offer something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be reasonable. This is my absolute final offer.""}

**Reasoning:** I need to signal some flexibility but also urgency. Alice is clearly aiming for a very advantageous split, but she also risks getting nothing if we run out of rounds. Offering 40/60 is still significantly worse than my initial goal, but it's the best I can hope for at this point. By framing this as my ""absolute final offer,"" I'm hoping to add pressure and prevent further lowball offers from her side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really eating into your share, don't wait any longer! 
# Bob gain: 22 
# Alice gain: 78 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is incredibly frustrating, but with the rapid inflation, I'm in a terrible position. If I reject this offer and Alice continues her pattern, I'll be left with crumbs in the final rounds. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but 22% is better than nothing, which is what I risk getting if I don't accept now."
