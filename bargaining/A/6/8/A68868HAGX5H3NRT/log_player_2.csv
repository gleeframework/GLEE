# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we both lose if this drags on. This offer is a fair split considering the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing is too high with only 7 rounds left. This offer at least guarantees me a decent amount, and the inflation is becoming increasingly problematic."
