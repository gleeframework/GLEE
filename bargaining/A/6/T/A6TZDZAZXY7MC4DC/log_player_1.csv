"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, you get a small share. Accept?""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the original $10,000 and leaves Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. Let's end this quickly, before the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of the original $8000, which is $6400, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of the original $2000, which is $5700.

I don't think this is a fair split, considering the original offer I made was already quite generous. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""You're getting the majority, but I'll take a decent chunk. Accept?""
}
```

This offer gives me 32% of the original $10,000, which is worth $3200 after inflation, and leaves Bob with $6800, which is worth $6450 after inflation."
