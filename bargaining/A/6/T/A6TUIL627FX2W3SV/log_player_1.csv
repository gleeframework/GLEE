"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a fair and straightforward offer, proposing a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $400,000 I'd get is actually worth $360,000 in real value.

I'm not too happy about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better deal this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up much more""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still not too far off from the 50/50 mark."
