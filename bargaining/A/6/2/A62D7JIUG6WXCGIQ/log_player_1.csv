"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll give you a fair share.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* My share of $200,000 is worth 95% of $200,000, which is $190,000 (due to the 5% decrease in value).
* Bob's share of $800,000 is worth 80% of $800,000, which is $640,000 (due to the 20% decrease in value).

Given the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
