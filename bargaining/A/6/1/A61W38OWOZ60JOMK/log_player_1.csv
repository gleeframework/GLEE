"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep more for myself 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4500 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not give up more than I have to. I'll accept this offer.
