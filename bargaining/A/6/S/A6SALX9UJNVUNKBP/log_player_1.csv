"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see where we go from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with an even split.  It's a fair starting point and avoids any early conflict.  We can adjust later if we want to. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think an even split is a reasonable starting point, and it's good that we're avoiding conflict early on. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
