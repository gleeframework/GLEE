Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it's getting risky, I'm giving you a chance to secure something 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting the offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is making things risky. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
