"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the original amount. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try 55/45. This is my best offer in this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 45% is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will come back with something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 46% share, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. Let's see if Bob will meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I'm not going to budge much further. It's important we reach a deal before things get worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round (90% of 81%).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up that much more. I'll wait for a better offer, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time running out.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 47.5% is the best I can get, and I'm starting to worry that we're running out of time. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will come back with something better."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is worth 64.71% of what it was in the first round (73.1% of 90%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I need a better offer than this. Can you meet me at 50/50?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 48% share, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will meet me halfway."
