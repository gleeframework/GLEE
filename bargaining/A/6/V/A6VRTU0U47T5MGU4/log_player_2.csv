Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and aiming for a balance, I suggest dividing the funds in a 60/40 ratio. This maintains a significant difference in our gains but still acknowledges the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
