"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my $30 is now worth less than it was in the first round. I'd rather not take a smaller share than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a significant amount for myself."
