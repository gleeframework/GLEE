Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small amount. If he rejects, it's a bigger risk for him in the next round, as the money will be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's not a great offer, but with the inflation, the money will be worth even less if I reject.  It's better to take what I can get now."
