"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can take $4,000.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous for me. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I need to make a more aggressive offer to ensure I get a decent share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I need a bigger share to keep up. Take $3,000 and let's move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both avoid the further risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. I'm not sure if 60/40 is a good enough split for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially ending up with even less. I'll accept this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
