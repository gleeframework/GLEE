"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better. I'm offering a slightly more even split. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain staying the same value and Bob's money being worth 10% less, I'll need to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a big enough increase for me. I'd like to try to get more.""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it this way.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the money, which is a slightly better deal for me."
