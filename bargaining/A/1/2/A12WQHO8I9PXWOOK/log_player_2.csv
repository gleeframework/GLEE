"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a ""fair"" split in the traditional sense, the game's inflation mechanic favors me as the money is worth less for Alice than it is for me with each round. I can likely get a better deal for myself by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I believe this split is more fair considering the inflation we're facing. Let's see if we can make this work!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split.  This will ensure we both get something, and it's a fair compromise given the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to become a real problem. Accepting this 50/50 split guarantees I get something, which is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
