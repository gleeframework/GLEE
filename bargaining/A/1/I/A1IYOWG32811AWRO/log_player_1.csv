I'm going to propose a pretty generous deal in the first round.  I figure giving Bob a small amount will make him more likely to accept, and since the money is only worth 20% less for him in the next round, he'll probably see this as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in the next round, I can afford to reject and make a counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share this time, hoping he'll start to realize that his chances of getting more money are diminishing with each round."
