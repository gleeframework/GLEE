Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 4:1 split is more reasonable, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
