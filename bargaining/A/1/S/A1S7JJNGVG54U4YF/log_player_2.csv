"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince it's an even split, there's no reason to reject this offer. It's the fairest division possible, and I wouldn't want to risk getting less than half in subsequent rounds. Plus, with 12 rounds, there's a risk of not coming to an agreement and both of us getting nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees me $5000, which is a good outcome."
