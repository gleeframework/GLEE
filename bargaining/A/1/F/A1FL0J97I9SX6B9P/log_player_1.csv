"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better, Alice. Let's be a little more even-handed this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the rejection, Bob!

Considering the offer from Bob for Round 2, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite comfortable with the 60-40 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob?""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45, hoping it's more to Bob's liking."
