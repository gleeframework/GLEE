Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a counter-offer. We're both losing money as we go, let's settle this now with a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and I'm flexible, but this needs to benefit us both.  Let's close this deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is pointless. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  It's the fastest way to end this and minimize our losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly larger share in the remaining rounds, the inflation is significantly eating into the pot. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point guarantees me a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement.
