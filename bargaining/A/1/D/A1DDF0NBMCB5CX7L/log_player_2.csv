Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being flexible, Bob. This is a good deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still reasonable.  The longer we wait, the worse it gets, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting better, I need to hold out for a bit longer.  The inflation is hurting, but accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Alice isn't palatable. There's a chance she'll panic as the rounds dwindle and the risk of getting $0 looms."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to be a little more generous.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking and we both lose if this goes on. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough one, but the inflation is killing me. Alice is clearly holding firm, and this is the best offer I'm likely to get. Accepting a smaller share now is better than risking getting nothing at all if this goes to the final round."
