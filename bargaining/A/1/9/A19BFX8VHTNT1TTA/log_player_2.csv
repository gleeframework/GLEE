Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting you, let's settle now. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly detrimental, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half of the initial amount. It's worth taking a calculated risk for a couple more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, accept this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While the situation is getting dire with inflation eating into my potential gains, accepting this offer would mean I'm losing out on a significant chunk of the money. I need to hold out a little longer and hope Alice is willing to negotiate a fairer deal before time runs out."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. While the offered amount is significantly less than what I aimed for, rejecting it means risking a complete loss in the following rounds due to the rapid inflation. It's a tough decision, but it's the most logical one given the circumstances to salvage at least some of the initial amount."
