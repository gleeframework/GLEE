"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 3000 is actually equivalent to 2400 in the first round. That's a pretty significant reduction.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, considering the reduced value of the money. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the inflation. Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% in the first round and 20% in the second round), I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share, but I'm not getting left out in the cold. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, hoping to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get something, don't be too disappointed 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the 48.8% reduction, my gain of 2000 is equivalent to a mere 1040 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 2-8 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll have to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
