"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for myself 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking at a 40% decrease in the value of my share. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $400,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.
