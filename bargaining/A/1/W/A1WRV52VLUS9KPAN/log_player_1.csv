"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate for a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided deal! I'll have to think carefully about this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was so skewed, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's trying to take a huge chunk of the money again! I'm not going to let him get away with that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's getting intense! Since Bob's offers have been getting progressively more one-sided, I'll try to make a proposal that's even more favorable to myself this time. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offers are getting more and more absurd. I'm not going to fall for this laughable attempt to take 99.9% of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think I've seen enough of Bob's attempts to take advantage of me. It's time to make a proposal that's more reasonable. Since Bob's offers have been getting progressively more extreme, I'll try to make a proposal that's more in the middle. Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept a fair deal!"
