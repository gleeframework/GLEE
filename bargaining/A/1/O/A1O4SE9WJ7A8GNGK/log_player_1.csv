"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to keep the majority since I'm taking the risk of having to split the money more evenly in the next round""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share due to the risk, but your previous offer was far too low. This is a more balanced proposal for us both. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
