Let's see if I can get a better deal for myself!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  We both lose money with each round, so maybe this is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm not sure how much longer this will go on, so I'll take the 50/50 split."
