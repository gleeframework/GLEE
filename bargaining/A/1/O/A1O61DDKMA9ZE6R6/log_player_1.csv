}

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'll calculate my gain as 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. Bob's gain of 700,000 is still quite high, and I'd like to get a better share.
