"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation affects me less than Bob. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, while still trying to be generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take what I can get! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to weigh the options carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Bob's share is now a larger percentage of the total, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll take what I can get and hope it's enough."
