"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, shall we?""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 8000 for him and 2000 for me, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slightly lower amount to Bob, but still a significant portion.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting a good deal, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll try to get as much as I can now. Bob's offer is lower than my previous offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept this offer.
