"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one right out of the gate, but that offer heavily favors Alice. It's worth seeing what I can get in a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's a very generous offer Alice, but how about we split it a bit more evenly this time?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but that's still a significant difference, especially considering the money is losing value for me each round.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""We're getting close, Alice.  This seems like a fair split, and we should settle before the money shrinks any further.""}
