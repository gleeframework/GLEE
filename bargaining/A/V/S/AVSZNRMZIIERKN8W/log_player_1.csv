"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll offer Bob $10,000 and keep $990,000 for myself. I want to maximize my share but also leave some incentive for Bob to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, my share is still worth significantly more than it would be in the next round due to inflation. It's better to accept Bob's offer now and secure a larger share of the diminishing value."
