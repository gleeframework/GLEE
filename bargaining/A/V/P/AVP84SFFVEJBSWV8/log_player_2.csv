"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not sure about this offer. It might be better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, as I'm the one making the proposal then, and the money will be worth more to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, given the inflation we'll both be facing. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is hurting me more than Alice, and I think I can get a better share if I keep rejecting and force her to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to budge a little, but I'm still feeling the effects of inflation. Let's work together to find a fair solution before the money becomes worthless!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me too, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a better share. Even though the inflation is hurting me a lot, I'm confident I can get a bigger portion if I wait just one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""We're running out of time! Inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a solution before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting me very hard at this point. I'm losing a lot of potential earnings with each round. Even though I would prefer a bigger share, I think it's best to take Alice's offer and get something rather than risk getting nothing."
