"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I deserve a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob, with a message suggesting that she believes she deserves a bit more than half. The game has just begun, and the effects of inflation have not yet taken hold. It's now Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round, where he will make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, Alice. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer from round 2, despite the effects of inflation that reduce the value of the money for both players, but more significantly for Alice. Alice seems to be holding out for a better deal, perhaps hoping that Bob will be more generous in the next round or that she can negotiate a better split by making a counteroffer. The game will proceed to the next round, where Alice will make a new proposal to divide the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice takes into account the effects of inflation from the previous rounds and proposes a division that is closer to equal, but still slightly in her favor. Her message suggests a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground, acknowledging the decreasing value of the money for both players. It's now Bob's turn to consider this offer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer in the next round."
