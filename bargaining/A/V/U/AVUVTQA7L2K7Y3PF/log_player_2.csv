Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation. Let's compromise at 58 for me and 42 for you. This way, we both get a slightly bigger share than your last offer, while still acknowledging the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
