"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. You can think about it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round, which is a 33.3% decrease.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, especially considering the value of my potential gain is decreasing with each round. I'd like to propose a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split. Can you meet me at 55-45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 in the first round is now worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000), and my gain of $3,200 in the second round is now worth $2,560 (80% of $3,200).

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This way, you'll still get a good share, but I'll get the majority.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 in the first round is now worth $2,048 (48.8% of $4,000).

Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is not acceptable to me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 40-60 split. Can you meet me at 45-55?""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3,200 in the second round is now worth $1,638.40 (48.8% of $3,200), and my gain of $2,560 in the third round is now worth $1,255.52 (48.8% of $2,560).

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a bit more. This way, you'll still get a good share, but I'll get a slightly larger majority.""
