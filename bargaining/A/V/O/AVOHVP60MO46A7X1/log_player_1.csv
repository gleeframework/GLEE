"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get more in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $1,600 (2000 * 0.8).

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's a very lopsided split in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation (80% * 80% = 64%), I'll aim for a smaller share that still reflects the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You're getting a bigger share than I did last round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a bigger share, but I'll give you a small chance to get something 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%), so I'd be getting $1,024 (1000 * 1.024).

This offer is still quite lopsided in Bob's favor, and I'm not happy with the idea of getting only $1,024. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value, I'll aim for a smaller share that still reflects the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1600,
  ""bob_gain"": 8400,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with all the money, Bob! I'm making a stronger offer this time.""
}
