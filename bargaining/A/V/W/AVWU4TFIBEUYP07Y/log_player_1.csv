"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  I figure Bob might be tempted by a quick win, even though it's a small share.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less generous than mine, and the inflation is working against me at this point. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to 80/20, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  With the inflation, Bob's share is shrinking faster than mine, so he might be more willing to compromise at this point.  Let's see if this works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Inflation is hurting him more, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm going to reject and try to get a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but not by much.  Inflation is hitting Bob hard, so he might be more desperate for a deal at this point.  I'm still hoping to get a good share, but I also want to avoid running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not happy with it. With inflation hitting him so hard, I'm confident I can push for a better deal. I'll reject and try for a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

Inflation is really starting to take its toll, and Bob's share is shrinking rapidly.  I'm going to offer 60/40, which is still a decent deal for me, and I think might be tempting enough for Bob to take at this point.  Let's see what happens!"
