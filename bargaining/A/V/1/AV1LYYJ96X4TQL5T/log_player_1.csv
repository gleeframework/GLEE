"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is interested in accepting the offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $4,000 instead of $4,500.

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer this round, as I'd like to negotiate further to get a better share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept your offer. I'd like to propose a different split this round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the previous round), my share is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'll aim to get a better share this round.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```"
