{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to start with a fairer split, I believe this is more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a good offer for me. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this offer is too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both take 50 dollars. This is a more equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
