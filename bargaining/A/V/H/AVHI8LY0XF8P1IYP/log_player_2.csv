Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I should get a bigger chunk considering the inflation will affect me less.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. The inflation is hitting us both hard, so a 50/50 split seems the most fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
