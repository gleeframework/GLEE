"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims for an equal division considering the risk of inflation. Please consider it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While an equal division is appealing, the risk of inflation means that accepting this offer in the first round would be a significant loss for Bob.  Bob should try to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds, especially considering the diminishing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the risk of inflation, giving me a slightly larger share for taking the initiative. We can continue to negotiate if you find this offer unacceptable.""}
