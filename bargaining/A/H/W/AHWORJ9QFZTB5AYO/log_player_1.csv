I propose to take 9000$ and Bob gets 1000$. I'm aiming for a good share, but I want to make sure we both get something in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
