Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:**  While my gain is worth less due to inflation, Alice's gain is worth significantly less. This is a good opportunity to secure a larger share.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means going to another round where my share could decrease further. It's more beneficial to accept the offer, even though it's not ideal."
