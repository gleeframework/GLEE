I'm going for a greedy first offer, knowing that inflation will likely force Bob to accept something less favorable in later rounds. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to pull a fast one! While I'm losing 20%, he's only losing 5% of the value of his initial offer. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 8000,  since inflation is hitting me harder. This should be a fairer compromise, but I still want to get the majority of the share."
