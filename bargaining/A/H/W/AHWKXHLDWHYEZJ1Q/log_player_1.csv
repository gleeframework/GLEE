"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself. I figure Bob will likely reject this, but it sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to pull a fast one! I'm not going to accept this offer, even though it's my turn to propose next. I'm going to try to negotiate a better split, even though the inflation will hurt my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time. Even with inflation, I'm still getting a good portion of the money. This should be more attractive to Bob, hopefully leading to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm not giving in. Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm hoping he'll see that we both need to find a solution sooner rather than later. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to try a different approach this time, offering Bob a larger share.  Inflation is really hurting me now, so I need to find a compromise quickly.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
