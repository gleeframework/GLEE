"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45 and keeping $55 for myself, with a message that suggests we're being fair and reasonable. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering Bob's offer gives me $45, which is less than what I offered him in the first round, I think I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $47 and keeping $53 for myself. Given that the money is worth 10% less to Bob now (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'm trying to find a compromise that takes the decreasing value of the money to Bob into account while still being reasonable for both parties. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering Bob's message that this is his final offer, and taking into account that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round but significantly less to Bob due to inflation, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. I'll get $48, which is relatively close to the midpoint, and further negotiations might lead to a less favorable outcome. Time to end the game!"
