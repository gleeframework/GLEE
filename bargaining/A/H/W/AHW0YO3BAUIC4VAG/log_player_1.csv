"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but it's a decent offer, and Bob will still get a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll have to settle for $100,000, which is worth 90% of the original $100,000 due to inflation.
