"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 in Round 1 is now worth $4,800 (80% of $6,000).

Bob's offer for Round 2 is $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him, which is a 50-50 split. Since I was offered a 60-40 split in Round 1, which is better than this offer, I will reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, my gain from Round 2 is worth 80% of $4,800, which is $3,840. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, I get 40% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 60%."
