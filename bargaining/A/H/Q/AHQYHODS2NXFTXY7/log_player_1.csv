Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is more fair, considering the inflation we both face. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims his offer is fair, he's taking advantage of the fact that the money devalues faster for him.  He's aiming for a larger share knowing that even with inflation, he'll still get a good chunk. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn. This deal gets us both a reasonable amount considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I've lowered my initial demand slightly to make the offer more enticing to Bob. However, I'm still aiming for a larger share than him, recognizing that the devaluation impacts him more.  This offer presents a balance between maximizing my potential gain and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting."
