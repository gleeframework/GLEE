"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that appeals to fairness. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also considering the impact of inflation on the value of money in subsequent rounds. By starting with a higher offer for myself, I'm setting a baseline for negotiations and also considering that each round decreases the value of the money, which affects me more significantly than Bob. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, encouraging him to consider this as a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This offer accounts for the inflation we'll both experience. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, I need to reassess what would be a fair or acceptable offer. In the first round, the total value was $10,000. Considering the inflation rates (20% for me and 5% for Bob), the value of the money has decreased, but not equally for both of us. The offer from Bob of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him seems less favorable when considering the original value and the impact of inflation. Accepting this offer would mean I'm agreeing to a split that doesn't account for the disproportionate effect of inflation on my share. Thus, rejecting and moving to the next round gives me a chance to propose a division that better reflects these changes in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation from the previous rounds. Given that I'm affected more by inflation (20% decrease each round for me vs. 5% for Bob), my goal is to find a balance that still makes the offer attractive to Bob while compensating for my losses. By adjusting the amounts to $5,250 for myself and $4,750 for Bob, I'm making a concession from my original offer while also being mindful of the value changes. The message aims to convey that I'm actively considering the impact of inflation on our negotiations, hoping that Bob will recognize this effort to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and comparing it to Bob's loss of only 14.26%, the offer of $4,750 for me and $5,250 for Bob becomes more reasonable. Given that Bob has framed this as his ""final offer"" with a ""take it or leave it"" message, it suggests there's little to no room for further negotiation. Continuing to reject offers would only lead to further devaluation of the money, likely resulting in worse outcomes for me. Accepting this offer now seems to be the most pragmatic decision, as it secures a tangible amount rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds."
