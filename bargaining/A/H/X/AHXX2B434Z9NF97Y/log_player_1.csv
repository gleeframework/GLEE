I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good offer, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. On one hand, it's a significant difference from the initial offer, and Bob is trying to be generous. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I should settle for a smaller share.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.
