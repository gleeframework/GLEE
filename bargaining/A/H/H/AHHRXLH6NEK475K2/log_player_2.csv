# Alice gain: 60

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need more than 30%.  Let's meet in the middle with a 48/52 split.  This gives you a good deal, and still ensures I get something worthwhile after inflation. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
