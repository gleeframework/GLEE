4500.0,5500.0,"Your split seems unfair to me. How about we go for a 55-45 split in my favor this time? This way I get slightly more, but you still get a good chunk before the inflation hits too hard.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"I understand your concerns, but I think 55-45 is too much in your favor. How about we meet in the middle at 58-42? This way, we both get a decent amount, and we should settle before the inflation gets worse.",Alice,3,

4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, we need to settle this quickly.  I'm willing to come down a bit to 53-47.  It's still in my favor as I'm taking on more risk with the inflation, but it's a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's close this out.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but 53-47 is still not acceptable to me. Considering the inflation is hitting me harder, I think 56-44 is a more reasonable split. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Alice,5,
