I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see if he's reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll take my chances with the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more to avoid another rejection.  Let's see if Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous.  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't let him. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still trying to get a majority, but I'm reducing my offer further to incentivize Bob to accept. I'm hoping he'll realize that if we keep going, the value of the money will keep decreasing, and we'll both lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly stubborn, but I refuse to be bullied into accepting his unreasonable offers.  I'll continue to try and negotiate a fair split, knowing that with each passing round, the potential losses for both of us increase."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

The stakes are getting higher. Bob's greed is pushing us closer to getting nothing. I'm reducing my offer slightly again, but I need to see some movement from Bob. I'm hoping he will realize that continuing this game is not in either of our best interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation, and his greed is becoming increasingly apparent.  While his offer is tempting due to the diminished value of the money, I refuse to be bullied into accepting such a lopsided deal.  I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split, even if it means risking a loss for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm starting to feel like Bob is being completely unreasonable. If he rejects this offer, we're both going to be losing a lot of money. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in our best interests to reach a compromise."
