"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to meet in the middle!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that. In this round, my gain of $5000 is equivalent to $6000 in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5000 is equivalent to $6250 in the first round.

Considering this, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's meet a bit above the middle.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much. This is my last compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values in the first round to understand Bob's offer better. My gain of $5200 is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $4800 is worth 51.2% of the original $4000, which is $2048. 

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a significant compromise, and I think I can do better than this. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need to make sure I get a fair share. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 380, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. I'm hoping this will be the final compromise."
