Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I hope he accepts and we can get this done quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's better than risking further inflation and getting nothing."
