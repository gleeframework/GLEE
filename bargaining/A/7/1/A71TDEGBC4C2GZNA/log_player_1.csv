"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll make the first offer""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%. I'm making the first offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the offer from Bob is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 6,000 / 0.9 = 6,667 (in Round 1 dollars)
Bob gain: 4,000 / 0.9 = 4,444 (in Round 1 dollars)

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
