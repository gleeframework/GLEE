Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 75/25, with me receiving 75 dollars. I believe this is a fair offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation will hit me harder. I'm willing to take a larger share now to minimize the impact later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rates and previous offers, I propose a 60/40 split. This balances our shares while accounting for the diminishing value of money in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Alice is trying to take advantage of the fact that I previously offered a 60/40 split, and now she's mirroring that offer. However, I'm not willing to accept it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer.

""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving you a free pass on the inflation advantage. I think 50/50 is the fairest split now.""}"
