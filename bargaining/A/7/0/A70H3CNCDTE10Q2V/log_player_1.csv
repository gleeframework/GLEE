"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair - we should switch from the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is simply a reversal of the previous round, and still disadvantages me even with the inflation working against him. It's early in the game, so I'm willing to hold out for a better offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5200,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be reasonable, but the split needs to be closer to even. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob claims this is his final offer, it's still early in the game. His offer is barely better for me than his previous one. The inflation is steadily working against him, so I believe I can secure a better deal by waiting.  I'm willing to push him further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""It seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical and split the money evenly. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Offering an even split accomplishes a few things:

* **Appears Fair:** It presents a strong image of fairness, which can be persuasive to Bob, especially since he's been pushing for a near-even split anyway.
* **Time Pressure:**  With time running out, a simple and straightforward offer increases the chances of a quick resolution. 
* **Inflation Factor:** While Bob might be holding out for a slightly larger share, the continuous inflation means that his potential gain is diminishing with every round. 

This offer aims to capitalize on the time pressure and the increasing impact of inflation to encourage Bob to accept a deal that's beneficial for both of us."
