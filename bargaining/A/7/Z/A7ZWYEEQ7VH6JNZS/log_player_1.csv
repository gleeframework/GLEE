"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  I hope to get this done quickly and avoid any inflation issues!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not as good as my original proposal, I don't want to risk further inflation."
