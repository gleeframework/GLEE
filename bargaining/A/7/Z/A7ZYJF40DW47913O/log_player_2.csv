"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. Think about the losses in further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer seems reasonable at first glance, Bob has 12 rounds to make a counter offer, and with each passing round the money is worth less to Alice.  It's in Bob's best interest to see if he can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation effect.  This gives us both a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer is still generous considering the inflation.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should continue to reject.  While the offer is more even than the first round, Bob has 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal.  The inflation is still working in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice,  we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  This offer gives you a substantial share while ensuring I also get a fair cut.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It gives me a slight advantage, but it's the best way to ensure we both walk away with a decent amount before the inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should continue to reject.  He has 7 rounds left and the money is depreciating faster for Alice than it is for him.  He can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing a lot of money with each passing round.  I'm offering you a fair amount, and I'm willing to go a little higher if it means we can finally come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money rapidly. This offer is a compromise, take it before it's too late for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should still reject.  Alice's offer is a small improvement from the previous round, but the inflation is still working more strongly in Bob's favor.  He has 5 rounds remaining to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both in a tough spot now.  This offer gives you a share, but I need to secure a larger portion to make it worth my while.  We're running out of time, so let's try to reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting absurd. A 50/50 split is the only fair option left at this point. Take it or we both lose EVERYTHING. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but Bob should accept. 

* **The Inflation Factor:**  While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation is now heavily against both of them.  Each round is significantly reducing the value of the money for both players.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate risks getting nothing at all.  While Bob could try to get a slightly better deal, the chances of that happening in the remaining 3 rounds are slim.  He's likely to lose a significant portion of his potential gains due to inflation.

A 50/50 split is the most logical choice given the circumstances, ensuring both players get something before the entire amount becomes worthless."
