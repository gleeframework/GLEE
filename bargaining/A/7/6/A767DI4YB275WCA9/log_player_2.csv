"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share, but I'll give you a decent amount to start with. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While 100,000$ is a significant sum, accepting it in round 1 would set a bad precedent for the rest of the game. I'm willing to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It considers the time value of money with inflation, offering us both a good deal. What do you think?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, considering the inflation, it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough considering the inflation working against me.  I need to push for a more significant gain while it's still early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more.""
