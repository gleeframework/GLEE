"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both considering inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, demonstrating that a more balanced approach is necessary. 
* **My Counter-Offer:**  I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous split that still holds appeal for Alice.
    * I get slightly more due to the higher inflation impact on my end.
    * The message emphasizes that accepting now is in both our best interests due to the decreasing value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now much closer to a reasonable split, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation.  Waiting longer risks further devaluation of the money, making the potential gains from holding out less appealing than accepting a decent offer now."
