"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation we're dealing with. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice.  I'm proposing a more balanced 45/55 split.  Let's make a deal and avoid further losses from inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than it hurts you.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. It's important we settle this quickly. Time is literally money in this game! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that the inflation hurts her more, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's better to hold out a bit longer and hope for a better deal in the next round, where I can make the offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation is a factor, but I need a fair deal. A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. Let's settle this now before we both lose out more.""}
