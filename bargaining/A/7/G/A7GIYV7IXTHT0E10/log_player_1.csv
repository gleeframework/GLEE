"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to adjust my expectations accordingly. However, I'm not sure if an even split is the best option for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a slightly more generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little less this time, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money keeps decreasing! With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to keep the negotiations going."
