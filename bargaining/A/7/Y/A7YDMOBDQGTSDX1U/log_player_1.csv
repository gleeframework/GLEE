"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the low offer, it's a good start for me! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and having even less value for my share.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
