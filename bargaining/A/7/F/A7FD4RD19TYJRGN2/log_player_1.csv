"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll be getting $20, which is 20% of the original $100, and then reduced by 20% due to inflation, so I'll actually get $16.

I'll accept this offer.
