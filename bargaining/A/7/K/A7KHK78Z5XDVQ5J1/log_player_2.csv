**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but there's still a decent chunk of money on the table. We're getting closer to the deadline, which will increase the pressure on her to make a better offer."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing increases. Applying pressure with a ""final offer"" could prompt Alice to make a decision.
* **Slight Concession:** A small concession from the previous 55/45 split shows a willingness to negotiate, but the message makes it clear this is the limit.
* **Aiming for Advantage:**  While a 50/50 split is ideal,  getting slightly more than Alice puts Bob in a stronger position if she rejects and the game continues."
