"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I'm not going to give you all the money.""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't want to wait too long, as inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure of inflation is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to split it down the middle yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further and get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up on getting a better share, especially with the inflation eating away at the value of the money. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking a toll now, and the money is worth 20% less than it was in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal to make up for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the 50/50 split, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
