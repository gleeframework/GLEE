Let's see if Bob wants to take my generous offer! ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with the inflation, this is still a decent gain for me.  Let's see if I can get lucky and maybe the inflation will affect Bob more next round!"
