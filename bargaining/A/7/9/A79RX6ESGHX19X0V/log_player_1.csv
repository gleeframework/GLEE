Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to get a bigger one. This is my last offer, let's see if you accept it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would ideally want a larger share, inflation has significantly reduced my potential earnings. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas rejecting it might lead to us both getting nothing. It's a risky gamble to keep rejecting, especially with only 6 rounds left."
