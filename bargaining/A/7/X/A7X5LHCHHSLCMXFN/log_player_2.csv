Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, I still have some leverage.  Alice might be feeling overconfident after I said my last offer was final. It's a risky game of chicken now, but I need to try and push my luck a bit further given the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, you drive a hard bargain. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Splitting it evenly is not enough for me. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me!  While this is less than I want, rejecting this offer and facing further rounds with even more inflation is too risky.  Alice clearly understands the advantage she has."
