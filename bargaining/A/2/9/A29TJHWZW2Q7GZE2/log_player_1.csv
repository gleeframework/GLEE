"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd actually get $475,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to meet in the middle and get $475,000."
