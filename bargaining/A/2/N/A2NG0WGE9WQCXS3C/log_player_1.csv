"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. This way, we can both get a decent chunk of the money and still have room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50-50 split, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's a 50-50 split, and it's a significant improvement from the initial offer. The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain, so I'll take the $5,000. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
