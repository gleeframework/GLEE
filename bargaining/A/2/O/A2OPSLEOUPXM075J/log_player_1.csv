"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering to split the money 50/50. It's a fair start!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the relative value of the money I'll get in this offer.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
