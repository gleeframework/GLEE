Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure if Bob is smart, he'll take it and we can move on.  But if he rejects, then I know I'll have more leverage in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's clear Bob isn't going to accept being taken advantage of.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather get half the money than risk getting nothing at all."
