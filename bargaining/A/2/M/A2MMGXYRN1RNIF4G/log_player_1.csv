"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to receive $600,000 while Bob receives $400,000. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that this division is reasonable and should be accepted to avoid further rounds where the value of the money decreases due to inflation, particularly affecting Bob's share. By accepting this offer, Bob would secure $400,000 without the risk of losing more value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest option, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the appeal to fairness, accepting this division would mean I'm getting less than what I initially proposed ($600,000). Since the value of the money for me does not decrease with rounds, I have an incentive to hold out for a better offer or to make a counteroffer that benefits me more, especially considering Bob is under pressure due to the devaluing of his potential gains with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the decreasing value for you""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my proposed share to $650,000, while decreasing Bob's share to $350,000. The message ""Consider the decreasing value for you"" aims to pressure Bob into accepting this offer by reminding him that with each passing round, the value of his potential gains decreases by 5%, making the current offer more appealing compared to potentially lower future values. This strategy leverages the asymmetrical impact of inflation in the game to my advantage, as the value of my gains remains constant across rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further inflation. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to concede more, the proposed division of $550,000 for me is still less than what I've previously aimed for ($600,000 in Round 1 and $650,000 in Round 3). Given that the value of the money for me remains constant and Bob is experiencing a significant decrease in value due to inflation (14.26% less than the first round), I believe I can negotiate for a better share. The pressure of inflation on Bob's potential gains gives me leverage to either wait for a more favorable offer or make another counteroffer that could benefit me even more."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you hard, reconsider your stance""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $700,000, while decreasing Bob's share to $300,000. The message ""Inflation is hitting you hard, reconsider your stance"" is a direct reminder to Bob of the significant impact inflation is having on his potential gains, now worth 14.26% less than in the first round. This offer and message combination aims to strongly persuade Bob that accepting this division is preferable to risking further devaluation of his share in subsequent rounds. By highlighting the consequences of continued negotiation, I'm attempting to leverage the pressure of inflation to secure a more favorable outcome for myself."
