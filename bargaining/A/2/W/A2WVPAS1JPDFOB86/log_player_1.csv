"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, with a message that suggests a slightly unequal but still relatively fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. This is better than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less in this round, I need to consider the reduced value of the offer. However, considering the decreasing value of the money, it might be wise to accept a reasonable offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Given the adjusted values, Bob's offer seems relatively fair, especially considering the message that suggests it's better than waiting for further rounds where the money would devalue even more. Thus, I decide to accept this offer to secure a guaranteed amount now rather than risking a potentially worse outcome later.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if this is the correct format and if the game is concluded with my acceptance."
