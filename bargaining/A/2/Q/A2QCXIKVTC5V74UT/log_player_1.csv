Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
