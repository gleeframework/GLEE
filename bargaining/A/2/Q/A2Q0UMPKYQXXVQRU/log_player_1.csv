"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... 

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively losing 10% of my potential gain compared to the 50-50 split I initially proposed. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, but he's still getting a larger share than me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

Considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively losing 10% of my potential gain compared to the 50-50 split I initially proposed. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it... 

Since the difference between Bob's gain and mine is only 1000$, I'll accept this offer to get a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split.
