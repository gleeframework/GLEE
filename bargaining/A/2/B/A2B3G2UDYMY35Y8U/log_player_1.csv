"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a significant portion, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd rather get more money in the current round to make up for the loss. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal now. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'll get a bit more than in the previous round, taking into account the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, but I'll think it's better to accept this one to get something.
