"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%. My message is a challenge to see if Bob can come up with a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed with your first offer, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth only 80% of what it was in the previous round.

I will accept Bob's offer for the time being. Here is my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
