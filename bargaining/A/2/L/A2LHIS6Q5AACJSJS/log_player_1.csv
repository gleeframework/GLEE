"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that I think is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}

I'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, while still trying to come out ahead. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
