Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 45%.  Let's split it 52.5/47.5.  This takes into account the inflation, but also gives us both a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250
