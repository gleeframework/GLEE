650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I propose we split the money with me receiving $650,000 and you receiving $350,000. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation working against me. What do you think?",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This reflects the impact of inflation on both of us as the game goes on.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but your previous offer wasn't fair in light of the inflation. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This reflects the increasing pressure on me as the game progresses.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, we're reaching a critical point. I'm adjusting my offer slightly to 52/48 in my favor.  This reflects the time pressure and the fact that your position weakens with each round.  Let's close this deal and avoid losing everything.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split to end this.  I'm losing significantly with each round due to the inflation, and I'm willing to compromise for a fair deal.  Let's be rational and split the money evenly.",Alice,5,
