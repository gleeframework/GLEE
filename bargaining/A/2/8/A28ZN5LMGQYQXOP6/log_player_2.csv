"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair, the potential of getting more money with inflation makes it risky to accept right away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'll take a 60/40 split this round. Inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to be fair.  What do you say?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this round, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor has already significantly impacted the value of the money.  This offer is still a better outcome than the previous round, and it seems like a good compromise.  I'll accept."
