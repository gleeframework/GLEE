"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55-45 is more fair considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I'm willing to compromise due to the inflation, but I won't go lower than 50%. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the offer since the money is worth less with each round, and Alice is unlikely to offer more than 50% in the future rounds."
