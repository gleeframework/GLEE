"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20. I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer for you.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000. I'm framing it as a generous offer, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair and equal division 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about splitting it 50-50, as I was hoping to get a bigger share. The fact that Bob's offer is worth 20% less than my initial offer is also a consideration. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight edge. This 70-30 split is a fair compromise, don't you think?""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but still keeping a bit more for myself. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to get a decent share. This 60-40 split is a reasonable compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get a bit desperate, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Bob's offer is still not ideal, but it's the best one I've seen so far. I'll accept the 60-40 split, hoping that it's the best I can get."
