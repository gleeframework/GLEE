"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I take a slightly larger share considering the inflation disadvantage I have. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates in mind, I believe I can propose a more favorable division for myself. Please let's move on to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer considering the inflation impact on both of us. Since Alice's money is worth 20% less each round, and mine is worth 10% less, I'll adjust the offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 420000,
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've adjusted the shares. This way, we both get a decent amount, but I've taken into account the higher depreciation of your share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation situation, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a compromise for us to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Given the increased impact of inflation, especially on Alice's share, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round. The fact that Alice is losing value faster means she might be more inclined to settle sooner rather than later, which could work in my favor. Let's move on to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares, but more significantly on Alice's, I'll adjust my offer to reflect this changing dynamic. My proposal aims to find a balance between our interests while acknowledging the pressure inflation puts on Alice to settle.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Given the accelerating depreciation of your share, I've made an adjustment to my offer. I believe this division is more reflective of our current situation, taking into account the urgent need for a resolution due to inflation.""}"
