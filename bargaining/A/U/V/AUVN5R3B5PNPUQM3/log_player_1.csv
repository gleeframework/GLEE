I propose that I take 900,000 dollars and Bob takes 100,000 dollars.  This is a fair offer that will likely result in us both getting some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose we split the money 60/40, with me receiving 600,000 dollars and Bob receiving 400,000 dollars. This offer is more fair than the previous one, and I believe it is in both our best interests to agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose we split the money evenly, each taking 500,000 dollars. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I think we both need to compromise to get anything at all."
