Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but it's important to recognize the time pressure.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ 57.5% for me and 42.5% for you. This ensures we both benefit sooner rather than later with inflation eating away at the value.

# Alice gain: 575000
