I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 20% cut. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a fairer split for me, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a better deal. Even with inflation, I think I can negotiate a higher percentage for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this down the middle. It's a fair compromise given the inflation and our bargaining positions.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share given my initial offer was 80% 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a 50/50 split, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I still get a decent share, and prevents further losses due to inflation."
