"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving $200,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering we both have a chance to negotiate in the future. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $380,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $540,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth 90% of the original amount (95% * 95% = 90.25%) and Bob's gain will be worth 81% of the original amount (90% * 90% = 81%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a fairer split for me, considering the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this down the middle. It's a fair compromise given the inflation and our bargaining positions. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $500,000 is worth 49.75% of the original amount (85.74% * 57.69% = 49.75%). Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 45% of the original amount (72.9% * 68.6% = 50.1%).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering I've been making concessions so far.
