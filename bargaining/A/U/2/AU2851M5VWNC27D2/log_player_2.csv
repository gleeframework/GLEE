"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to myself, considering the inflation rate. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to make the most of the first few rounds.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. This is better than what we'll get if we keep going. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 19% less, I need to consider whether this offer is better than what I might get in future rounds, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. Alice's offer of $4200 for me is slightly more than the 4000 she offered initially, but it's still not considering the full impact of inflation on my end.\n\nGiven that the gap between what Alice and I consider ""fair"" is still quite wide, and considering the message from Alice emphasizing practicality, I think there's still room for negotiation.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the increasing impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","As we enter the fourth round, I'll take into account the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 28.9% less than in the first round. Considering this, I need to adjust my proposal to ensure I'm getting a fair share, given the decreasing value of the money.\n\nI'll make an offer that reflects the urgency of the situation and the need to come to an agreement before the value of the money drops further. Given Alice's previous offers, I'll try to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us, while also emphasizing the need for a quick resolution.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard. Let's settle on this before it's worth even less.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
