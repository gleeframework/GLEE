Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I'll begrudgingly accept.  

Here's why:

* **Inflation is Hurting:**  Every round, my potential gains decrease significantly. 
* **Alice is Stubborn:** She seems set on getting more than half.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee she'll offer anything better, and the longer this goes, the worse it gets for me. 

While 43 isn't ideal, it's better than risking even less in future rounds."
