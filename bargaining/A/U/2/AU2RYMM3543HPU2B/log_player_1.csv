"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better, I'll take 60% and you take 40%. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think I'm giving away too much. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, with me taking 45% and Bob taking 55%."
