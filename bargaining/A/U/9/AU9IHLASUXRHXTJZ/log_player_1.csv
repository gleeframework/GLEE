"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll be generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100, and keeping $60 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $20 gain is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually worth $18.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'll be getting $18, which is still less than half of the original $100, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain will be worth 81% of its original value due to the 10% inflation. Since Bob's gain is still worth the same as in Round 2, I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $55, which is 55% of the original $100, and keeping $45 for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping Bob will consider this a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My $45 gain from Round 3 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's actually worth $32.61.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is still worth the same as in Round 2, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of money.

I'll accept this offer, hoping to at least get some money out of this game.
