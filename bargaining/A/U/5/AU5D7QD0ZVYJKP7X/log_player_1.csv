"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous amount considering the inflation rate. If he accepts, we can both get something and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. This is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is identical to mine from Round 1, but with the same numbers. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to be careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can finish this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
