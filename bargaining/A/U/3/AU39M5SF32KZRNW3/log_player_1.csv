I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I want to secure the majority of the money while still giving Bob something to consider. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting too greedy! I'll take my chances with another round of negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  We're running out of time, and I think Bob will be more inclined to accept something closer to my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It seems like Bob has realized he's not getting any more favorable offers.  I'll take the 60% and call it a day. The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk losing more."
