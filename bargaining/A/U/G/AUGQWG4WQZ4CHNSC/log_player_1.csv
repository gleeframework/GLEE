I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd like more, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all, especially with inflation kicking in. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
