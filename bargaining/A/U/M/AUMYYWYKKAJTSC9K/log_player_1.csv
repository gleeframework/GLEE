"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total, and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'll take half, you take half. No need for this inflation game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is quite straightforward and fair, considering the circumstances.

I accept the offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
