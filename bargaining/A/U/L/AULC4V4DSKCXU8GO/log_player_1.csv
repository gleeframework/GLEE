"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept it to get something rather than risking going to Round 2 with inflation already eating into the total value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still quite generous, I'll consider it carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to reject this offer and see if Bob will be willing to make a better offer in the next round, taking into account the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal if you wait""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it before the inflation eats into the value of the money even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal than this. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money, I need to be more careful with my decision. However, Bob's offer seems to be similar to his previous one, and I'm not sure if he's willing to compromise further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will be willing to make a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less than in Round 4. I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to make up for the lost value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or walk away""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, hoping that Bob will accept it before the inflation makes the money almost worthless."
