"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $300,000 I would gain in this round is worth less than the $900,000 I would have gained in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll aim to get a bigger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being stingy, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if this will be more appealing to him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I should get more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $450,000 I would gain in this round is worth even less than the $600,000 I would have gained in the third round. I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. I'll consider it, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept yet.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get an even better deal. With the inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll aim to get a bigger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting impatient, Bob. You're not being generous enough. I need more.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and split it 50/50. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $500,000 I would gain in this round is worth a tiny fraction of the $900,000 I would have gained in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I think 50/50 is a reasonable compromise, especially since the money is worth so little at this point. I'll accept this offer.
