```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a quick resolution to the game."

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting Bob's offer.

```

I'm not satisfied with the split, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

# Bob gain: 420000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is the best I can get, and I'm willing to wait for a better deal."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been waiting long enough, and this offer seems reasonable given the current circumstances. I'm willing to accept and end the game."
