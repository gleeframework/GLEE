"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that I take $90 and Bob takes $10.  This is a fairly generous offer, but I want to ensure that I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation makes it less appealing to keep rejecting offers.  Taking $70 is better than risking getting less in the next round."
