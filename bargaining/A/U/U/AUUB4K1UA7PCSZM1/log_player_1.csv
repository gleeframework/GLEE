"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair share. Accept and we can seal the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment from my end, let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the values are now:

* Alice gain: 6000
* Bob gain: 4000

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
