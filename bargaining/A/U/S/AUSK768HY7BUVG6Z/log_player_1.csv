"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  It's in my best interest to end this sooner rather than later, as inflation will affect me less than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher share, accepting this offer is the best choice for me. The inflation will continue to hurt Bob more than me, so if we go to another round, it's likely he'll offer me even less."
