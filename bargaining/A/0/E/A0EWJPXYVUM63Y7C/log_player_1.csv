"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount, and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a good starting point, but I can do better 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is the best I can get. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will wait for a better proposal from him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the current amount, and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a hint that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $400,000, which is 40% of the current amount. I'm hoping this will be the last round, and I'll finally get some cash!"
