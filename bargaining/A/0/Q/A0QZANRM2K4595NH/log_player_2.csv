While the offer is tempting, I'm going to try to get a bigger share. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice is offering a slightly better deal than her first offer, and the inflation is starting to hurt. It's time to take the deal."
