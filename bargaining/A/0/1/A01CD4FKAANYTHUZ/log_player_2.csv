"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a significant increase from Alice's offer, but I believe it's still fair considering the potential for inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept this offer. While the inflation has reduced my potential gains, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, especially considering the risk of getting nothing if we continue."
