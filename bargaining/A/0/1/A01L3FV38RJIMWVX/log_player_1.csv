I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split, favoring myself as the proposer in the first round.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant amount, I believe I can still secure a better deal, especially considering the inflation disadvantage he faces.  It's time to turn the tables and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a 550,000 - 450,000 split, reversing Bob's offer from the previous round. Given the inflation impact, this should be a more attractive deal for him, while still giving me a substantial share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  While the inflation has eroded my potential gains, the 500,000 split is a fair and equitable outcome considering the bargaining power shift due to inflation. It's better to secure a reasonable deal now than risk further losses in subsequent rounds."
