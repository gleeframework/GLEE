"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep 99 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar. This ensures I get the majority of the money, but also offers Bob something to potentially accept. Since we have many rounds, I'm not afraid to take the risk of him rejecting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still unfavorable to me. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially since the money is worth less for Bob with each round. I'll see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is still a significant amount for him, considering the inflation. This time, I'm taking a bigger share, but I'm confident I can make a better offer if he rejects this one."
