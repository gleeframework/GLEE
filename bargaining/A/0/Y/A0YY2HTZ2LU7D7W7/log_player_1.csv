Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking a big share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 9500 
# Bob gain: 500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the 9500, I'm confident I can get a better deal. Bob's offer shows that he's willing to compromise, but I believe I can push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 8500, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm hoping Bob will be more receptive this time, especially with inflation starting to take effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8200 
# Bob gain: 1800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While Bob has adjusted his offer slightly, I believe I can do better. Inflation is starting to hurt, but I have several rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for such a low share yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a decent split. I'm lowering my share to 8000, but I'm still aiming for a majority. This is my final attempt to secure a good deal before inflation really starts to hurt."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7800 
# Bob gain: 2200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite now, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer.  I'm taking Bob's deal. I'm glad I held out for a bit, but I'm not sure I could have squeezed much more out of him."
