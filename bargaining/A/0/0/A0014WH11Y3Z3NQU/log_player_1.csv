Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts you more than it hurts me. I'm proposing a split that reflects this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer is a win-win. It acknowledges the inflation while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims his offer is a win-win, it's heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation working against me. Accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half of the original amount. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. I'm taking a hit from the inflation, but this offer ensures we both get a reasonable share.  Time is running out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a slight adjustment to Bob's previous offer, flipping the amounts to favor me. This is a strategic move for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  The rounds are progressing, and the value for me is diminishing quickly.  I need to incentivize Bob to settle soon.
* **Fairness:**  While the inflation is a factor, a near-even split is more equitable in the long run.
* **Compromise:** My offer shows a willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to accept or counter with something more favorable."
