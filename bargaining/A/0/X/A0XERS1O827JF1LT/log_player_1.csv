"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to reconsider with a slightly more generous offer. This is my best shot! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less now, I'd be getting $300,000, which is $240,000 less than my initial offer. Considering Bob's message and the fact that this is his ""best shot"", I'll try to be reasonable.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
