Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 600,000, you get 400,000.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
