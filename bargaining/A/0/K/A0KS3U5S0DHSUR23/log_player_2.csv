"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer does provide me with a considerable sum, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Even though the money is worth less for me each round, rejecting and proposing in the next round will give me the opportunity to secure a better deal for myself.  With each passing round, Alice's potential gains will shrink due to inflation, motivating her to accept a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. However, I'd like a more balanced split. This offer takes inflation into account and provides a fair share for both of us."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm offering a good deal considering the faster inflation working against you. This is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly more favorable to me than her previous offer, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation rates. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself by continuing to reject offers and proposing my own in the upcoming rounds.  Each round, Alice's potential gains decrease due to inflation, which will likely pressure her to accept a more balanced proposal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing value with each round.  This offer is a fair and equal split, ensuring we both get the maximum possible value before further inflation.""
