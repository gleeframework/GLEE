"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you $20, and I'll take $80. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased. Considering the new values, I'll make a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40/60, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

This time, I'm offering you $55, and I'll take $45."
