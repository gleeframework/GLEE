"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $3200 in ""real"" value.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
