"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a terrible deal. It's a 95/5 split in his favor, and with the inflation, I'm getting a measly $50,000 (worth even less than that in the previous round). I will definitely reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While I'm willing to compromise,  I still want a better deal than Bob's previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too lopsided. Even with the inflation, a 20/80 split is not acceptable. I'll continue to negotiate for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation and Bob's previous proposals. I believe it's a fair compromise that gives us both a decent share of the money."
