This is a fair starting offer. I believe a 60/40 split is a reasonable starting point, with me taking slightly more since I am the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob offered me 45 and took 55 for himself. While his offer was not terrible, I am still feeling confident that I can get a better deal, even with the inflation affecting my potential gains. I am raising my offer slightly to 55/45 to show that I am willing to compromise, but I believe I deserve more of the money since I'm the one making the offer this round."
