800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but my previous offer was more than fair. Time is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm standing my ground. This offer is a good balance given the circumstances. You need to accept that the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for you. Don't let pride cost you everything!",Bob,8,
