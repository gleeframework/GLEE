Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share. Let's compromise.  This offer is closer to a true 50/50 split, accounting for the decreasing value of the money.  We can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
