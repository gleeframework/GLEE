750000.0,250000.0,Let's divide the money fairly. I propose a split of 750000 for me and 250000 for you. It's a fair deal considering the diminishing value of money in each subsequent round.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering the diminishing value of money. Let's work together to maximize our gains.,Bob,2,
