"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent chunk to keep him happy. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

My proposal for Round 2 is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather wait for a better deal, 50-50 is too even for me!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.6 = 6666.67
* Bob gain: 4000 / 0.6 = 6666.67

My proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but I want to keep the majority!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice gain: 6000 / 0.516 (48.8% less) = 11611.76 (but since we can't have a fraction of a dollar, I'll round down to 11611)
* Bob gain: 4000 / 0.516 = 7773.88 (round down to 7773)

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""It's a good deal, I'll take it!""
}
```"
