"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, a fair share. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. This is a generous offer, considering I'm giving him more than half of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 200k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is even more skewed towards his favor. I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not fair, I deserve more than 20%!""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the second round. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 450k, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a 45% share of the reduced $900,000 (after inflation). This is a slightly more aggressive offer, but I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the need to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards his favor, but I need to consider the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""300k is still too low, considering the inflation. I think I deserve more than 30%!""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. I need to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 500k, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of by inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $500,000, which is a 50% share of the reduced $800,000 (after inflation). This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the need to get a decent share."
