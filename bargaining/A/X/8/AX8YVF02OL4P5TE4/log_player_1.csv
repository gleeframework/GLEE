"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $300,000, and I'll take the rest. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's work together to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $360,000. And Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $570,000.

Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'm willing to accept it.
