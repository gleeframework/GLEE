"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the remaining money equally.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, so let's not prolong this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### I'll accept this offer. The inflation is indeed hitting me harder, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round. Splitting the remaining money equally seems like a reasonable compromise at this point."
