"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split, given the decreasing value of money. I'll wait for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer, taking into account the decreased value of money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair given the decreasing value of money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
