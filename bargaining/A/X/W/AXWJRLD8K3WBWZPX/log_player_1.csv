"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to receive $550,000 and suggests that Bob receive $450,000. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer by framing it as a fair and sensible division of the money. The offer is made in the context of the game's rules, where each round reduces the value of the money for both players, but more significantly for Bob. By making this offer, Alice aims to find a balance between maximizing her gain and increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept, thus ending the game early and avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer. Despite the inflation reducing the value of the money, Alice is motivated to continue the game in hopes of securing a better deal. Bob's offer gives Alice $450,000, which is less than what she proposed for herself in the first round. By rejecting, Alice is willing to take the risk of further devaluation in pursuit of a more favorable division of the money. She also recognizes that the devaluation affects Bob more significantly, which might pressure him into making a more favorable offer in the next round or accepting a slightly less favorable deal. This strategic decision aims to leverage the game's mechanics to Alice's advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice adjusts her strategy by proposing a division that is closer to the middle ground between her initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By suggesting $520,000 for herself and $480,000 for Bob, Alice aims to appear more flexible and willing to compromise. The message ""Meet me in the middle?"" is a rhetorical gesture to convey a sense of fairness and mutual concession, potentially making the offer more appealing to Bob. Given the increasing pressure of inflation, which affects Bob more significantly, Alice hopes that this offer will be perceived as a reasonable compromise, encouraging Bob to accept and conclude the game before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems like a fair compromise. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, Alice recognizes that prolonging the game further may not yield a substantially better outcome. Bob's offer of $490,000 for Alice and $510,000 for himself is closer to a 50/50 split, considering the devalued state of the money. Given the ""take it or leave it"" message from Bob, Alice interprets this as a final offer and concludes that the marginal gain from potentially negotiating further is outweighed by the risk of the money devaluing even more. By accepting, Alice secures a significant amount, albeit less than initially desired, and ends the game before the value of the money decreases any further."
