"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, $50 is equivalent to $47.50 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than half of the money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to further inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
