# Alice gain: 45

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value decreases by 20% with each round. Bob rejected my first offer, and I rejected his second offer.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the money
Since the value decreases by 20% each round, after two rounds, the value of the money is 80% * 80% = 64% of its original value.

### Step 3: Determine a fair and strategic offer
Given the decreasing value and the need to come to an agreement before the 12th round, I should make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer but still advantageous to me, considering the decreasing value of the money.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer and message
I will offer myself 55% and Bob 45%, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, acknowledging the urgency and the devaluation of money. My message will convey a sense of compromise and urgency.

### Step 5: Prepare the offer in the required format
The offer in JSON format will reflect the new division and include a message urging Bob to accept given the circumstances.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's compromise before the money loses more value!""}"
