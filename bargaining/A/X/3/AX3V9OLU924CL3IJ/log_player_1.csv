"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. I'm keeping $60, which is 60% of the original $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll make sure to adjust my calculation.

In Round 1, I had $60, and due to 5% inflation, it's now worth 95% of that, which is $57.

Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, which means I'd get $50, and Bob would get $50.

I'd rather have a bit more, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, I'll make sure to adjust my calculation.

In Round 2, I had $57, and due to 5% inflation, it's now worth 95% of that, which is $54.15.

I'll offer Bob $45, which is a bit less than half, and I'll keep $55.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A bit less for me, but still a good deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small cut, but I'm willing to give you a chance to accept 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in Round 4:

In Round 1, I had $60, and due to 5% inflation, it's now worth 95% of that, which is $57. Then, in Round 2, it's worth 95% of $57, which is $54.15. In Round 3, it's worth 95% of $54.15, which is $51.44. Now, in Round 4, it's worth 85.74% of $51.44, which is $44.15.

Bob's offer is to give me $40, and he'll take $60.

I'd rather have more, but I'm starting to get a bit worried about the time running out. I'll accept this offer.
