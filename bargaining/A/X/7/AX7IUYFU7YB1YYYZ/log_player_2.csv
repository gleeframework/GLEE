"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent cut. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's better to see what kind of deals she's willing to make in future rounds. The game is about maximizing your share, and rejection lets you see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be more equitable this time. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the value decrease in the coming rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a larger share, knowing the value is decreasing. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, the proposed split still heavily favors her.  Continuing to reject allows for further negotiations and potentially a more equitable deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""The value is decreasing for both of us.  Let's split the money evenly this round. It's the fairest solution and ensures we both get something substantial before the value drops further.""}
