"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the value of the money will decrease by 20% with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I need to be strategic. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm not as attached to the value of the money as I was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
