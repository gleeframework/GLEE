"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

Let's split the money evenly to start the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd rather have a bit more now than a smaller amount later. I'll accept this offer.
