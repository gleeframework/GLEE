"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent share while still being generous to Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the $6000 I would have gotten in the first round is now worth $4800 in terms of purchasing power. Bob's offer of $5000 is actually a better deal for me in terms of purchasing power than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
