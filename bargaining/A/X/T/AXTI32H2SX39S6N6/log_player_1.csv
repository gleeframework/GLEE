"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more strategic now.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 4:1 split, especially with the money losing value due to inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who's going to get the majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The offer is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept a 7:3 split. I'll keep trying to negotiate for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob. Meet me at 4:6!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, trying to get closer to a 4:6 split, which seems more reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money."
