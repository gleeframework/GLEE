"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can start fresh.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  An even split seems like the best way to ensure we both get a good share.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to kick in!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. An even split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me considering the inflation.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is getting worse! The money is worth 40% less than in the first round now.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a fair share too.  Let's close this deal and avoid further inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now! The money is worth a significant amount less than it was initially.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I should take it. The edge I get is still smaller than what I initially proposed, but it's better than nothing, and it's a safer option given the inflation risks.
