"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $100,000 I'd get in this round is actually worth $90,000 in the previous round's terms.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to decide...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
