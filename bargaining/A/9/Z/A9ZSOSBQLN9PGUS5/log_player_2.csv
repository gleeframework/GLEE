Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation dynamics, but your offer was too skewed in your favor. Let's meet in the middle - this split acknowledges the time pressure while still being fair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the heat of the inflation, and her offer reflects that. While closer to a reasonable split, she's still trying to secure a slight advantage.  I'm willing to push my luck a bit further given the rapid devaluation of her share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. This is my final offer - it reflects the time pressure and provides a slight edge to me, which is fair in this situation.  Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my share slightly from my previous offer while still offering Alice more than she would have gotten in the previous round. This offer is designed to be enticing enough for her to accept, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, especially for her. I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to add a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  My previous offer was more than fair. This is my final compromise - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and her offer is barely in her favor now. While I could push for a slightly better deal in the next round, there's a real risk that Alice will play hardball and our gains will be significantly eroded by the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
