"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $80 and Bob receives $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, the actual value of the money I would gain in this round is 40 * 0.8 = 32.

I accept the offer.
