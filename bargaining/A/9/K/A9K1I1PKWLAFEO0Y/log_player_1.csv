"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose taking 90 dollars for myself and giving Bob 10 dollars. This is a fair starting point, as it is a large difference in our favor, but still leaves Bob with something.  I hope this will encourage him to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my original proposal. Even though the inflation affects him more, I am still getting a much smaller share. I believe I can negotiate a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 60 dollars for myself, while still giving Bob a significant portion (40 dollars). This offer is still advantageous for me, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than I wanted initially, Bob's offer is getting worse with each round due to inflation.  Accepting this offer guarantees me 50 dollars, which is better than risking getting nothing by continuing the game.  It's a 50/50 split, which is fair given the circumstances."
