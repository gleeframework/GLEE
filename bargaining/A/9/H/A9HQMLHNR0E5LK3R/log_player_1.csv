"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his own proposal."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a good starting point, but I'd like to adjust it slightly in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, as I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob, trying to balance the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more to account for the inflation, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not convinced that I should accept a 45/55 split, as it's still not ideal for me.

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, taking into account the harsh effects of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up any more. It's time to make a decision.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the fairest deal I can make considering the current value of the money. It's time for Bob to decide!"
