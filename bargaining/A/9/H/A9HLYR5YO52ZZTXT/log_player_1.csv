"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, I'll try to do the same. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I want to accept Bob's offer. I was hoping to get a bit more than 55% of the initial amount. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
