"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 55, you take 45.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm afraid that wasn't quite fair. How about we reverse the roles this time?""}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's offer was advantageous to her and slightly disadvantageous to me. It's better to negotiate.
* **My offer:** I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer. This puts the negotiation pressure on her. 
* **Time pressure:**  The longer the game goes, the less valuable the money becomes for me due to inflation. I want to reach a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try again. I'll take 60 this time, and you can have 40.  Remember, inflation is working against you, so it's in your best interest to accept this deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting greedier:** Alice's offer is even more skewed in her favor. She's clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor.
* **Still room to negotiate:** I need to show Alice that I won't be bullied by her tactics. Rejecting this offer signals I'm willing to risk further inflation to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong stance:** By proposing a perfectly even split, I'm demonstrating that I'm not interested in playing her game of maximizing her own gains. 
* **Time pressure:**  Inflation is becoming a significant factor. Every round that passes, I lose more value. A 50/50 split is better than risking further inflation for a slightly larger gain.
* **Appealing to reason:**  Hopefully, Alice will see the fairness in a 50/50 split and realize that dragging this out further is only hurting both of us in the long run."
