Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split seems a little off considering the inflation hits you harder. How about 45/55? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm sticking with 60/40.  The inflation makes every round count and this is a fair split.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Look, it's clear we both want a good chunk of this money. 50/50 is the fairest I can go. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
 
This is a tough one! While ideally, I'd like a larger share, Bob is unlikely to offer more. Accepting the 50/50 split ensures I at least get something before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."
