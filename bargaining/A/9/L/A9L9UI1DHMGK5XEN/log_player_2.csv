"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer divides the money equally. I propose we split it 600000 for you and 400000 for me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  This is a more favorable outcome for me, and hopefully we can end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest an equal division of the funds, as it seems fair and efficient given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting hard. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the 500,000 is a decent amount after the inflation."
