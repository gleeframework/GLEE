Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer significantly undervalues my position given the rapid inflation affecting your share. Let's be more realistic. This offer still allows you to walk away with a good sum considering the alternative. 
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","This is a tough situation! Bob is playing hardball and betting that you'll crack under the pressure of the rapidly devaluing money.  Here's my approach for this round:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're willing to gamble with both our futures, but I'm drawing a line.  This is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. If you reject it, we both lose significantly. Don't be greedy.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Appearing Strong:**  We're matching Bob's language to show we're also willing to walk away if we don't get a decent deal.
* **Finality:**  Declaring this the ""final offer"" adds weight and forces a decision point for Bob. 
* **Consequence:** Highlighting the mutual loss from continued rejection emphasizes that Bob loses out too if he's being overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk Appetite:**  This assumes some risk tolerance. There's a chance Bob will reject this, leaving us with a difficult choice in Round 6. 
* **Bob's Psychology:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat rational and doesn't want to walk away with nothing.

Let's see what Bob does!"
