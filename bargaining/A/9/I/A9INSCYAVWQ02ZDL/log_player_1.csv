"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases quickly for you.  This offer gives you a better deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the next round's inflation!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's now my turn again. Here's my next offer:
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the next round's inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the money will be worth even less for both of us in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n

I'll accept Bob's offer. The money is worth significantly less for me now, and Bob's offer is not likely to improve in the next round. It's better to take the 35 dollars now rather than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round."
