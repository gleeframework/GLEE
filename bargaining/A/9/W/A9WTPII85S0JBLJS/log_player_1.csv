"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to set a good tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this round 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 5% less, the even split doesn't feel as appealing as it did in the first round. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for this round.
