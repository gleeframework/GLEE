Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which means time is working in my favor.  While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I'm willing to gamble that she'll offer an even better deal in the next round due to the impact of inflation on her potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Last chance Alice, inflation is eating your share! Take this deal before it's too late.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This is a calculated risk.  I'm offering a slightly better deal than before, recognizing that Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. However, I'm still holding out for a larger share, hoping that the threat of getting an even smaller amount in the final round will push her to accept."
