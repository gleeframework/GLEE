"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This seems like a fair starting point.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Time is money, and the value decreases with each round. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share. This offer reflects the fact that the value of the money is decreasing for both of us. Let's come to an agreement this round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, and the longer I wait, the less the money is worth. Taking the deal now secures a reasonable amount.
