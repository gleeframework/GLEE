Let's see if Bob agrees to my generous offer!  üòÑ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer! I know the money is worth less now due to inflation, but I'm not going to accept being shortchanged like this.  I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm still taking a big chunk, but I'm willing to compromise a little more this time.  Hopefully, Bob will realize it's better to take this deal than to risk another round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer.  Even with inflation, I'm being offered less than 20% of the total.  I'm going to keep trying for a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

This is getting risky, but I'm hoping Bob will see that he's getting a better deal than he would in the next round.  I'm still taking the lion's share, but it's a smaller lion this time! ü¶Å"
