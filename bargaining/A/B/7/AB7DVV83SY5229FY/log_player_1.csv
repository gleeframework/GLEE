Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know the inflation is hitting you hard, but I've been patient and made reasonable offers. This is my best one yet. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

Although not ideal, the rate of inflation is eating into my potential gains faster than Bob is willing to concede.  It's better to take a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting even less next round."
