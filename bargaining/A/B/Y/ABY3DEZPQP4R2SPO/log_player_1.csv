"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going for a very aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure almost all the money. This is a risky strategy, but with the potential for huge rewards if Bob accepts. The inflation factor adds an element of uncertainty, so I'm trying to maximize my gains quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from the previous round, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal. The inflation factor might be working in my favor, as Bob's gains are decreasing with each round. I'll aim for a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the first round but still aiming for a large share.  I believe Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation and might be more willing to accept a less favorable deal to avoid further losses. This offer strikes a balance between securing a significant amount and keeping the possibility of reaching a compromise in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation factor is significantly affecting Bob's gains, I still believe I can secure a better deal. I'm confident that my previous offers have shown Bob that I'm not willing to settle for a small share.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again. I'm reducing my share to a more reasonable 60%, recognizing that Bob's gains are significantly affected by inflation. This offer should be attractive to Bob while still allowing me to secure a good amount. I'm aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
