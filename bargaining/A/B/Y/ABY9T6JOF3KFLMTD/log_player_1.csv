Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it more evenly - I'll take 55 and you take 45.  This way we both get a good share and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
