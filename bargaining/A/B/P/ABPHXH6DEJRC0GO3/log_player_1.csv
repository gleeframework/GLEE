"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my first offer. I'm taking a large share, knowing that Bob will likely want to counter-propose and I'll get to make a counter-offer in round 3.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  It's not a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm willing to wait and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still enough to make it tempting for him to accept. I'm playing a game of chicken, and I'm hoping he'll blink first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. While Bob's offer is slightly better than his last one, it's still far from what I'd consider fair.  He's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, so I'm going to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of offering Bob a slightly smaller share each round.  He's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, and I think this offer might be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. He's feeling the pressure of inflation, and I think I can get a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly smaller share to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept. We're getting close to the end, and the pressure of inflation is starting to get to him. I think this offer might be enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5904 
# Bob gain: 4096 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to what I was hoping for, and the inflation is really starting to bite. It's time to take the deal and secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
