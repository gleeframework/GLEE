"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have an equal chance of making the next proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my original proposal, the inflation factor is now working against me. Accepting this offer ensures I still gain something, and the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round is high."
