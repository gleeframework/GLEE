"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to split the money more evenly. Let's be fair and accept this offer to avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll consider the value of the money. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer:

My gain: $6,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $5,500 (10% less than $6,200, which is the equivalent of $4,000 in the first round)

I'll reject Bob's offer because I can get more than $5,500 if I wait. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly smaller share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
