"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm looking for a more substantial difference in the split, and this proposal seems too equal for my taste. I'll reject it and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the current situation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While I'd like to get a larger share, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer, given the reduced value of my potential gains.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I can still make the most of it despite the inflation."
