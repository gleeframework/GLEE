Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise. I'm taking a bit more since I'm not getting hit by inflation as hard as you are. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
