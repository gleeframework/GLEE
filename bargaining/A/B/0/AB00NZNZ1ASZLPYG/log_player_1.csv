"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a fair share considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 10% decrease in value, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering Bob 48 dollars, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
