"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's get this done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is a decent chunk, but I'm keeping the majority for myself. Let's see if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a pretty reasonable proposal. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up my majority share just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob comes back with something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split it evenly, I'll try to counter with a proposal that keeps my majority share but offers him a slightly better deal than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You could've taken the first offer, now I'm giving you a bit more.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's still the fairest deal. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his ""even split"" idea. I'll consider the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my majority share.

However, I also don't want to risk Bob making another offer that might be even worse for me. I'll accept this offer, since it's the same as before and I'm not getting a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Time to end this game!"
