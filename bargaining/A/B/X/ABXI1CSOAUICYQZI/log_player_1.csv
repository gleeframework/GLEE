Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 50/50 split is fairer given the risk of inflation. Let's be reasonable and divide the money equally. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
