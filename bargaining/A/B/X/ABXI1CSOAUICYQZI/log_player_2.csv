Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We're losing money with every round. I'm proposing a compromise - slightly better for me than your offer, but still a win-win before inflation eats away more. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000
