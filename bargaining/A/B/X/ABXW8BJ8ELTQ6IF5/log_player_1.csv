"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant share while still giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I understand the dynamics of the game and the potential for inflation, this offer is too unfavorable to accept. I would prefer to continue the game and attempt to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share to $800,000 and increasing Bob's to $200,000. This is still a good deal for me, and it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I hope Bob will recognize this gesture and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I recognize Bob's strategy, this offer is still far too unfavorable to accept. I would prefer to continue the game and attempt to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm further lowering my share to $700,000 and increasing Bob's to $300,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I hope it will encourage Bob to consider accepting the offer. The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to secure a deal before it becomes even more unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the situation is becoming increasingly difficult,  Bob's offer is still too far from what I believe to be a fair split. I will reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to go down to $600,000 for myself, offering Bob $400,000.  We're approaching the halfway point of the game, and inflation is accelerating.  It's time for Bob to realize that continuing to reject offers could leave us both with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is simply unacceptable. Bob seems to be taking advantage of the inflation situation to try and squeeze me out of any significant share.  I will continue to play and try to negotiate a more reasonable split in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This offer is an even split, reflecting the rapidly escalating inflation and the limited number of rounds remaining. I believe it is the most reasonable solution to avoid ending with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insultingly low, and I will not accept it. I understand that the game is getting very risky and that inflation is increasing, but I would rather have nothing than accept such a paltry sum. I will try to reach a more equitable solution in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I am offering Bob $600,000 and keeping $400,000 for myself.  This is a significant concession on my part, recognizing the rapidly escalating inflation. I hope Bob understands that further rejection will lead to a situation where we both get nothing, and this offer is a chance for a reasonable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable. It is clear that Bob is deliberately trying to exploit the situation and leave me with nothing. I will not accept this insultingly low offer, even though the situation is becoming increasingly desperate."
