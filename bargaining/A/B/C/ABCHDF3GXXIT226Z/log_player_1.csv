"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather not give up 70% of the remaining money, especially since it's worth less than it was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn again. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm proposing a slight adjustment from my initial offer, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%."
