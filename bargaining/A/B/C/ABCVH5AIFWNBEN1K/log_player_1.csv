Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000$ and leave Bob with 1000$. It's a fair start, and since the money is worth less to me each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's frustrating to get such a small share, I'm accepting. My share is worth less with each round, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob."
