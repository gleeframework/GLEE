I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  It's a little aggressive, but I think it's fair considering I'm making the first move.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
A 6000/4000 split is still pretty good for me, and I'm not sure I'd get a better deal if we keep going. I'll take it!"
