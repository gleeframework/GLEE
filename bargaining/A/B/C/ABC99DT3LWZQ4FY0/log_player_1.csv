"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. My message to Bob is that we can start with a fair split and then negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  This is a fair starting point, and we can work from there. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the new amounts are:

My gain: 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000
Bob's gain: 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000

Bob's new offer is 500,000 for me and 500,000 for him. This is a fair split, and I'll accept it.
