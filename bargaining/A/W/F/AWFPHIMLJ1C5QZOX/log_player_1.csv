I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a slight advantage, but still allows for a significant amount for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and the money is now worth less due to inflation. I'll reject and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split this time. Since the money is now worth less and Bob rejected my previous offer, I think a fair compromise is to split the money evenly."
