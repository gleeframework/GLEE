"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is hitting Bob harder:**  While the money is losing value for both of us, Bob's share is depreciating at double the rate. This puts time pressure on him to make a deal.
* **Bob's offer isn't that great:**  Even with his proposed ""even split,"" he still gets slightly more than me. Considering the inflation working against him, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a favorable deal, take it while you can.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This is a decent offer considering the time constraint and inflation working against us both. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Here's why:**

* **Bob is feeling the pressure:** His message indicates awareness of the shrinking pot. This means I likely have leverage to push for a slightly better deal. 
* **The offer is getting closer, but not there yet:** Bob is inching closer to a more equitable split. However, his gain is still higher than mine, even with the faster inflation working against him. 

**Strategy:** My goal is to secure a deal where my gain is at least equal to Bob's, ideally slightly higher, to make up for the inflation disparity. I'll continue to apply pressure in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time to get serious, Bob.  This is a fair offer, and the pot shrinks with every passing minute. Don't miss out!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the tables:** I'm now asking for the same split Bob offered in the previous round, highlighting that it's a fair deal.
* **Increased pressure:** My message emphasizes the diminishing returns due to inflation, urging Bob to act quickly. 

I'm aiming to settle around this 52/48 split in the next round or two. Bob's willingness to offer a nearly even split suggests he understands the need for a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Finally!** Bob has come to his senses. While a 52/48 split would have been ideal, accepting this 50/50 offer ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  Further delays would only erode the value of the money, hurting both of us."
