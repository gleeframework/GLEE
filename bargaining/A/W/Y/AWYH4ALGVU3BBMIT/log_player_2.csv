I'm proposing a more even split. Let's see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll wait and see what Alice offers next round."

I'm going for an equal split this time. It's a fair deal, and maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise after rejecting my previous offer."
