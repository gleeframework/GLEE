"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000.  It's important to settle this early with the inflation ticking. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I also need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we split it 55/45?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's still pretty steep on your end considering the inflation is hitting me harder.  I'll come down a bit to $5,700 for me, $4,300 for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take a deal now before the inflation eats away at both of our gains!"
