"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm proposing to take 9000$ and leave Bob with 1000$.  This seems fair, given that I'm the one making the offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is taking a larger share, even though he is now the one making the offer! I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering to take 6000$ and leaving Bob with 4000$. This is a more balanced offer than Bob's last offer.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still a little bit higher than I'd like, but with inflation, the money is worth less and less.  It's not worth risking another round and potentially getting a smaller share. I'll accept this offer."
