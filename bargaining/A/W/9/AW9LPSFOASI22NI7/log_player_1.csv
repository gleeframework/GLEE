"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an unfair offer, now it's your turn to make a fair one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still biased towards you. I want a more equal split.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and asking for a more balanced split. Now it's my turn to make a new proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
