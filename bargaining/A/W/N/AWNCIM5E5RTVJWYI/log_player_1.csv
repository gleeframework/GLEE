Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. You're losing value faster than me, after all. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, with the inflation I'm losing a lot of value. It's better to take this offer and avoid further losses."
