"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split acknowledges my advantage in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided deal.  While Alice has the advantage in later rounds, we can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the early stages."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I believe a more even split is fair at this stage, as the inflation advantage hasn't fully kicked in yet.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment, but that offer heavily favors you in the long run. This is a more balanced approach considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still heavily favoring her. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept this offer yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split this time. The inflation is starting to affect us both significantly, and a more balanced approach is needed to ensure a fair outcome for both of us.""
