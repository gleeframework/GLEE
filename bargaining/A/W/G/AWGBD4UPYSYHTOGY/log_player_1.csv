"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a pretty aggressive first offer, but I'm trying to secure a large share while the money still has full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and while I lose some of my potential gains due to inflation, it's better than risking further devaluation by rejecting and making a counter-offer."
