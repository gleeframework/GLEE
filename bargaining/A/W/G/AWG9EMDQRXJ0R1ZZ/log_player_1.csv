"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 2000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 1600. The offer is still not in my favor, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the total amount of money is still 10,000, but it's worth 64% of its original value (since 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). My goal is to maximize my share while being cautious about Bob's intentions.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not giving up. You can have 68%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."

# Bob gain: 9000
