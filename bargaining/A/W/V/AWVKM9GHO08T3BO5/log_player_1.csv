Round 4

Even with the significant inflation, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting $42 now would be a considerable loss compared to what I could have gained in earlier rounds.  It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Bob will become more reasonable in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the extreme impact of inflation on your share, I believe this offer is reasonable and allows us to conclude the game. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

This is a tough decision, but I need to accept. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Waiting any longer is too risky, as I might end up with an even worse offer.  While not ideal, getting $38 is better than continuing to lose value and potentially getting even less."
