I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point given the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm willing to concede a bit, but I still believe a 54/46 split is fair, considering the inflation rates."
