"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we split the $100 with a 60/40 ratio. This offers a balanced approach while taking into account the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
