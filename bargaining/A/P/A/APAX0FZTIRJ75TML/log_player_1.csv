"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to give you $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000. It's a fair split, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm offering to give you $5,800, and I'll take the remaining $4,200. Let's see if this one is more appealing to you!"
