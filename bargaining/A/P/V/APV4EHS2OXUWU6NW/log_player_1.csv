}

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
