I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to maximize my gains as quickly as possible.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though Bob is taking most of the money, it's still a significant amount for me.  With inflation, I'm not sure how much longer the game will continue, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.  Accepting is the best option for me right now."
