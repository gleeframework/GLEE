"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself. I've included a message that says ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my proposal. Since it's the first round, there's no inflation yet, so the money is still worth its full value. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in my proposal and accept it, ending the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I'll take the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the message tries to spin it as ""fair,"" the division of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Bob doesn't seem fair to me, especially considering that the money I gain is now worth 10% less due to inflation. I'd rather take my chances and make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a compromise. Since the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value, and it will continue to decrease in value, I'll aim for a more even split to make up for the loss. I'll offer Bob $550,000 and take $450,000 for myself, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Finding a middle ground""}\n\nI've included a message that says ""Finding a middle ground"" to convey that I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, taking into account the effects of inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, ending the game."
