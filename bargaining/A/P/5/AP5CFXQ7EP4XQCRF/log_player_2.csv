Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was kind, but not very strategic. Let's be realistic. This offer is much better for me, and still gets you something before inflation eats away at the value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll go a little higher. I propose 45 for me and 55 for you. This way, we both get something while considering the inflation on your side. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
