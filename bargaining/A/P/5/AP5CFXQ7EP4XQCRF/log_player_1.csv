"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was kind, but not very strategic. Let's be realistic. This offer is much better for me, and still gets you something before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
