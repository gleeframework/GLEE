"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your share is worth significantly less each round. I'm offering a better deal this time, but it's the best you'll get.""
}
``` 
 reasoning:
* **Understanding the Urgency:**  Alice loses value much faster than Bob each round (20% vs. 5%). This means she's incentivized to take a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Exploiting the Time Pressure:**  Bob can afford to be a bit more aggressive knowing Alice is feeling the pressure of the devaluation. 
* **The Offer:** 4500 for Bob and 5500 for Alice is still better than what Alice would get if she rejects this offer and Bob offers her the bare minimum in the next round. 
* **The Message:**  The message aims to make Alice realize the deal's value while hinting that future offers might not be as generous."
