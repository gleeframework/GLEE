"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from the deal while considering the devaluation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Urgency:**  Bob's money loses value faster than mine. It's in his best interest to settle sooner.
* **Fairness with an Edge:** Offering slightly more than half acknowledges the devaluation and incentivizes Bob to accept. 
* **Setting the Tone:** A message that emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit aims to start the negotiation positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than Alice's offer. This proposal keeps more for me, but still gives you a significant share. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob's offer significantly favors him, taking advantage of the devaluation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting this offer would signal weakness and encourage Bob to push for even more in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Still Favors Me:** While inflation affects me, it hurts Bob more.  Delaying keeps the pressure on him to make a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer ensures a clean 50/50 split before the inflation hurts us both further.  It's time to settle.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Position:**  After rejecting Bob's greedy offer, proposing a 50/50 split now seems more reasonable and less like a starting point for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Mutual Loss:** Emphasizing that inflation negatively impacts both parties adds weight to the need for a swift resolution. 
* **Urgency:**  Time is a factor. While I'm willing to negotiate, prolonging the process only leads to smaller gains for both of us."
