"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. I want to ensure a fair outcome, but I also want to maximize my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a larger share, I believe this is a fair split considering the inflation factor and the limited number of rounds. It's better to secure half of the money than risk losing it all."
