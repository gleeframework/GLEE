{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent chunk.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decrease in value, I propose we split it 4500 for me and 5500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the split. I was hoping for a better deal considering the initial amount was $10,000. I'll wait for a better offer."
