"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going for a highly asymmetric offer in the first round. Since I'm not losing any value with each round, I'm going to try to maximize my share while giving Bob just enough to potentially incentivize him to accept in the hopes of getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  While the money is worth less to him each round, he's still offered me a paltry sum. I'll reject this and see if he's willing to be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer a more even split, recognizing that Bob's value of the money is diminishing.  Hopefully, he'll accept this offer before his potential gains become too small to be worth his time."

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still being incredibly stubborn!  He's clearly not understanding that his gains are rapidly diminishing, and he's not getting any closer to a reasonable split.  I'll reject his offer and see if he comes to his senses in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower split for myself, but still keeping the bulk of the money.  I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to compromise while still being fair to myself, hoping that Bob will finally see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still completely unreasonable! He's offering me less than half, even though his potential gains are shrinking rapidly. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'll reject this offer and continue to try and find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

Bob's greed is clearly getting out of hand. I'm going to lower my offer again, but still try to maintain a significant share.  I'm hoping that by showing willingness to compromise, I can finally get him to accept an offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still completely delusional! His gains are now worth less than half what they were in the first round, yet he's still refusing to offer me a fair share. I'll reject this and continue to fight for what I deserve."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the money. I'm starting to feel like Bob might be irrational, but I'm still hopeful that I can reach a deal with him.  I need to keep reminding him that his gains are getting smaller with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable. He's clearly clinging to the hope of getting a huge share, but his gains are quickly diminishing.  I won't give in to his greed. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't let him take advantage of me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

It's clear that Bob isn't going to budge on his demands. I'm going to offer him the same split he proposed in the last round, hoping he'll finally see the value in taking something rather than risking getting nothing at all.  At this point, his gains are so low that even a small share might be worth more to him than waiting for a better offer that might never come."
