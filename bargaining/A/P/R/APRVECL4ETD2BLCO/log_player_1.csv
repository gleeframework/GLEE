"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total. Let's see if we can do better next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving Bob 20% of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Here's a more equitable split. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, the new total is $8,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it...

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
