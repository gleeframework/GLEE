Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can do better than 0.1% of the total amount, especially since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to be more reasonable than Alice was in her first offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll aim for a relatively fair split, while also considering the decreasing value of the money for me.
