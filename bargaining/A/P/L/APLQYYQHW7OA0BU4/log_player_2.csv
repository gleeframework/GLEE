"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering I started 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, I get to propose this round, and the value is dropping.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's my turn again, considering inflation, let's be rational 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Alice's Offer:** While not ideal, 43 is better than what I was offered in Round 1, and significantly better than risking a worse offer in Round 4 where the money will be worth even less. 
* **Time Value:**  Getting something now is generally better than the uncertainty of getting something (potentially less) later.
