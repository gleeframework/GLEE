"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to set a strong tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is a better deal for both of us than the previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll on my gains, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is ""fair"" for me, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger hit on the money, I need to adjust my strategy. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 70/30""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit more conciliatory, but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40. This is a better deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. With the money being worth less and less, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of the money. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be even more aggressive in my negotiations. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or walk away""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit more urgent, implying that I'm not willing to make any further concessions."
