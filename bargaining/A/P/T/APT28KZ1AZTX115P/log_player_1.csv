Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is my initial offer.  I'm aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I'm also willing to compromise a bit. 
Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation and the limited rounds. It's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all."
