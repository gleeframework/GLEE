Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the amounts are the same as my initial proposal, just switched, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, even considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since we're now in the third round, the original $100 is worth 10% less than in the second round, and 20% less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer to try to reach an agreement.\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to receive $52, while Bob would receive $48.
