"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split, considering your 20% inflation rate. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal, considering the inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is fair considering the inflation rates. Let's move forward quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but 60/40 is too unbalanced. Let's find a middle ground before the inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is better than risking further inflation and getting nothing."
