"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is as generous as it seems.

However, I do appreciate the fact that Bob is trying to find a middle ground. I'll make a decision based on the current value of the money.

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer seems more generous than it initially appears.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I was hoping to get a better deal, and Bob's offer is still slightly unfavorable to me.
