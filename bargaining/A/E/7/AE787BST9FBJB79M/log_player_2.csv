"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, but I'm hoping for a more equitable split in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Alice's proposal is far from fair, and I believe we can do better. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and negotiate a more balanced split. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more balanced proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial split before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more than your last offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice is willing to compromise, her proposal still favors her significantly. Considering the money is worth 36% less for me now, I need to aim for a more substantial share to make up for the loss in value. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another proposal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll try to find a balance that considers the inflation.
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair. Let's find a mutually acceptable split before it's too late.""}"
