"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 7:3""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 200,000$ is now worth 160,000$.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not give Bob 800,000$, which is a significant amount. However, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and risk going to the next round.

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 128,000$ (80% of 160,000$).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 9:11""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I'm still the one who's going to get the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation in each of the three rounds, my gain of 128,000$ is now worth 67,059.20$ (80% of 84% of 160,000$).

I'm not happy with this offer. Bob is still trying to take the majority of the money, and I'm not getting a fair share. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth 53,017.92$ (80% of 84% of 160,000$).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a significant amount, but I need something for myself""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still willing to give Bob a substantial amount."
