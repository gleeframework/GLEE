"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split seems fair, it's still much less than my initial proposal. I'm hoping to get closer to my original 9000/1000 split, and I know I have the advantage in this round because the inflation is only affecting Bob's gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still maintaining a significant advantage. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as the inflation will continue to hurt his side with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me, and while I am not getting the same advantage as before, I am still gaining more than the 4000/6000 split. I will reject this offer and hope to get something closer to the 8000/2000 split I offered last round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but not by much.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the inflation is working against him, and that my offer is still more favorable to him than his recent proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and the inflation is clearly hurting him.  I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal, and I'm confident that I can get a better outcome if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal for myself.  I think Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, and he may be more willing to accept a deal closer to my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1700 
# Bob gain: 8300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly ridiculous, and the inflation is clearly hurting him. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  I'll counter with a fairer offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. Bob's offers have become increasingly unreasonable due to inflation, and it's time to show him that I'm not afraid to walk away with nothing if he doesn't come to a reasonable agreement."
