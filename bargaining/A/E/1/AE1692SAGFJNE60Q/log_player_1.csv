"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a significant amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more careful. Since Bob's offer is still quite close to the original amount, I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
