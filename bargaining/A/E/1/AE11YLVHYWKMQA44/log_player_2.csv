Round 4

**Reasoning:** Alice is barely budging while time (and my potential gains) are slipping away.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger portion, or at least a truly even split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation.  It's time to follow through on my word.  I'll accept nothing less than 50/50 now, even if it means losing everything."
