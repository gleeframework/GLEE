"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% of the money, is that fair?""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, while giving Bob 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 20% 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, considering the money I'll be getting is still worth 100% of its value, while Bob's share is worth only 80% of its value due to the 20% inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
