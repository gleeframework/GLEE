"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer. The money is worth less now, and I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a fair deal""
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money and gives Bob a slightly larger share. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much, I want a fair deal too 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a fair deal as well.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer. 42 is a reasonable share for me, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
