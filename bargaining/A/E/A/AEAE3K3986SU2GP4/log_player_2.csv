"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's better to see if Alice will offer more in the next round. The money is worth less each round, so it's better to wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth less each round. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a smaller share than before, but I think this is a fair split considering the value is decreasing for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, unlike if we keep rejecting and run out of rounds. The decreasing value of the money makes this a better deal than the previous rounds."
