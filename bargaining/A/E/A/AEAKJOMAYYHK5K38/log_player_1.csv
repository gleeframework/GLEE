"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 55-45, a fair and balanced deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and leaving $450,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable split, considering the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, given the inflation that will occur if we go to another round. This will be a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now than risk losing more value in the next round. I accept Bob's offer.
