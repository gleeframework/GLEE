"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can negotiate if you want to play more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000$ is something, it's not a great start, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  It gives us both a good share, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 60/40 split. It's closer to what I want, but still gives you a fair share. We can discuss further if you'd like, but the longer we play, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's a significant improvement over the previous rounds and the inflation is starting to bite.  I'm happy to take the 4000 and end the game."
