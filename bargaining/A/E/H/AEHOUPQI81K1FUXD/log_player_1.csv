"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not being too generous just yet! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount.

If I accept this offer, I'll get 200,000 in the original amount, which is equivalent to 160,000 in the current round's value. Not a bad deal, but I'm hoping to get a better share.
