"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob! Accept and we can call it a day.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. No need to negotiate too much. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good compromise. I'll accept it.
