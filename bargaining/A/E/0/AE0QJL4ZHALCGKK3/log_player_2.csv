"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bit too early to accept such a lopsided deal. Let's see if we can negotiate something better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be a bit more equitable. How about I take 60% and you get 40%? It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust from there.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 55% and you take 45%. We're both getting less than we hoped for due to inflation, so let's cut our losses and move on. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, inflation is hitting hard. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some gains before they diminish further."
