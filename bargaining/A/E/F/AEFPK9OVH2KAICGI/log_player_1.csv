Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something.  Inflation is a real threat and could significantly reduce my winnings in the future. It's better to secure half now than risk getting nothing at all."
