I'm taking a slightly greedy approach here. I'm assuming Bob doesn't know about the inflation yet, so a small amount for him might seem reasonable.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being extremely greedy! While I'm aware of the inflation, it's only affecting Bob's gains at this point.  I'll wait and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still trying to get a larger share, but I'm increasing Bob's portion slightly to see if he's more willing to compromise. Let's see if this offer is more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being extremely stubborn and greedy. The inflation is starting to have a noticeable effect on his gains, yet he's still offering me a paltry 10%. I'm not going to give in to his demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again, hoping to find a compromise.  The inflation is getting worse, and it's likely affecting Bob more than me now.  I'm starting to think he might actually be the one who's going to end up with less if we keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still stuck in his greedy mindset, offering me a ridiculously small share.  While I'm aware of the inflation, it's clearly impacting him more at this point. I'm sticking to my strategy of offering slightly more each round. He's going to have to come around eventually if he wants to get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to increase Bob's share, even though he's still being unreasonable. The inflation is really starting to hit him hard now, and I think he might be starting to panic a little.  Let's see if this offer finally makes him think twice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly delusional. The inflation is hitting him hard, yet he's still clinging to his unrealistic expectations. I'm not going to let him dictate the outcome of this game.  I'll continue to raise my offer and see if he finally comes to his senses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is it.  I'm offering a perfectly even split. Bob's greed is getting him absolutely nowhere, and the inflation is starting to hit him hard.  I'm not going to compromise anymore. If he wants to keep playing and risk getting nothing, then that's his choice.  This is my final offer."
