{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling to accept such a tiny share. $50,000 is almost nothing compared to the original $1,000,000. I'm not willing to accept this offer, even though it's my last chance. I'll have to live with the consequences of rejecting it."

I'm willing to give up my entire share and leave with nothing if Bob agrees to a 50/50 split. It's a long shot, but I have to try."
