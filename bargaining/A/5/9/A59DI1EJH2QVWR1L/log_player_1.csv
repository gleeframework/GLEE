"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point given the limited information about Bob's potential strategies. I want to maximize my potential gain while also ensuring a reasonable offer for Bob to consider in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer seems tempting in the short term, rejecting it is strategically advantageous. Bob is clearly attempting to maximize his share and is demonstrating a pattern of leveraging the inflation factor to his advantage. By rejecting, I maintain control and force Bob to adjust his strategy in the next round. Additionally,  I believe the inflation factor will continue to work in my favor as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This offer is a significant adjustment from the previous round, indicating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome. By offering a substantial increase in Bob's share, I aim to incentivize him to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation.  However, I'm still prioritizing my own interests, as I need to ensure a substantial portion of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is tempting, rejecting it is strategically advantageous. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation factor, and this pattern suggests that he is willing to push for a very favorable split.  It's clear that he is aiming for a 60/40 split in his favor. By rejecting, I can force him to adjust his strategy. There are still many rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better outcome.  The inflation factor is working in my favor as the game progresses, and I can leverage it to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. Bob has been increasingly aggressive, so I'm aiming to strike a balance between showing flexibility and maintaining a strong position.  The inflation factor is starting to have a significant impact, and I believe Bob is feeling the pressure.  I'm aiming to secure a more favorable split than the previous round while still offering a fair deal to avoid risking further rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a clear indication that he's determined to secure a significant share of the remaining money. While it's tempting to accept due to the inflation factor, rejecting it is strategically advantageous. This pattern of his behavior suggests that he's willing to push for a highly favorable split.  I'm confident that the inflation factor will work in my favor as the game progresses. I can leverage it to my advantage in the next round and potentially negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose a 80/20 split. This offer is a significant concession, indicating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome. By offering a substantial increase in Bob's share, I aim to incentivize him to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation. The inflation factor is working in my favor, and with only 5 rounds left, I need to secure a deal that benefits me."
