"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000. We can both walk away happy.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $6,000 is still a significant amount. However, Bob's gain is now worth 5% less, which means he's getting $7,600 in ""real"" value.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than $2,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a bite out of Bob's gains!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the real value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $6,000 is still a decent amount. However, Bob's gain is now worth 14.26% less than the original $4,000, which is approximately $3,444.20 in ""real"" value.
