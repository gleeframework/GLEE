"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving myself the larger share. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping to secure a good chunk of the money before inflation starts eating away at its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a sizable chunk of the money.  Bob's offer is better than what I proposed, and I don't want to risk him taking even more in the next round due to the continued inflation."
