"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get 1000 dollars.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and if Alice rejects, I'll be in a position to make a slightly more favorable offer next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with a 20/80 split.  Inflation is biting, but I'm hoping Alice will come around to a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

Alice's offer keeps getting worse, and I'm feeling the pinch of inflation. I'm going to offer a 50/50 split this time. It's fair, and I hope it's enough for her to accept."
