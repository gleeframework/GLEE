"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, leaving 30% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the high stakes of the game and the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to be more cautious. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll stick to my original offer to maintain a competitive edge. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to pressure Bob. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to take a larger share:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
