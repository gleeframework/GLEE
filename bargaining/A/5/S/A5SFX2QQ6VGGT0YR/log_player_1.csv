"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation, considering that the money loses value for both of us over time, but more so for Bob. My message to Bob is ""Let's divide fairly"" to set a tone for a mutually agreeable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more than a fair share to get this over with quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to appear generous by offering me more than what might be considered ""fair"" in a normal situation, the fact that the money loses value over time, especially for Bob, means that this offer isn't as good as it seems. Given the inflation rates, I can potentially get a better deal in future rounds as Bob's share becomes less valuable more quickly than mine. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, it's better to settle now""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, especially on Bob's share, I'll make an offer that reflects the urgency for Bob to settle sooner rather than later. By offering Bob 30% of the money, I'm taking into account that his share is devaluing more rapidly than mine, making this offer relatively more generous in real terms than it appears at face value. My message to Bob is ""Consider the inflation, it's better to settle now,"" aiming to persuade him that accepting this offer is in his best interest due to the diminishing value of his potential gains over time."
