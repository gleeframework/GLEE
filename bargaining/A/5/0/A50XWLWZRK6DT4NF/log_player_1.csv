I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I get less than my initial proposal, the inflation makes it risky to keep going. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome in this situation."
