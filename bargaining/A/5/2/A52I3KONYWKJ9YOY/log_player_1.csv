"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 70-30 split just yet. I'd like to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more balanced split. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I still want to keep a slight edge.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more balanced than my initial offer, but still slightly favors me. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 45-55 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share. Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a very fair and equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal!"
