"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money, after all.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's offer was advantageous for her in the long run. Rejecting it signals that Bob won't be easily swayed by an initial ""fair"" offer.
* **Time pressure:**  The message emphasizes the decreasing value of the money, subtly pushing Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Slight advantage, but not greedy:** Offering Alice $4,500 is still a reasonable sum, especially considering it will be worth less in the next round. This makes the offer more likely to be accepted than a heavily skewed one in Bob's favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, adjusted for inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. Waiting another round means a significantly smaller pie for both players.
* **Reasonable offer:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is now closer to a true middle ground, especially factoring in the inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks Alice proposing an even less favorable deal in the next round, where the money will be worth even less. 

It's better for Bob to take a slightly less advantageous deal now than risk losing more money to inflation."
