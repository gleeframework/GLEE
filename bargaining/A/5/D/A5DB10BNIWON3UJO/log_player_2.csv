# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling the inflation pinch. This offer is a compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, this is a fair adjustment 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. While the impact is increasing, I still have some leverage. Rejecting this low offer shows I'm serious about getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. Inflation is hurting us both, let's end this.""} 

**Reasoning:** Time is running out and the value of the money is steadily decreasing for me.  This offer is still favorable to Alice, but it's the most I'm willing to concede.  The ""final offer"" message adds pressure for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing a tough game, but this offer is barely better than my last one considering the inflation. Accepting now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds, or even nothing at all if we fail to agree."
