"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can adjust as we go. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split, and while the money will be worth less later, I'm confident I can negotiate a much fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That split was too harsh, Alice. How about something more reasonable? This gives us both a good chunk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be a little more reasonable this time. I'm willing to take less, but I'm sure we can find a split we're both happy with. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is budging, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show I'm willing to walk away to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop dancing around. This is a fair offer and gives us both a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, Bob. This split gives you a good amount, and it's getting riskier to keep rejecting.  Let's avoid losing out completely. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is still not ideal, but the effects of inflation are starting to sting. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount, while continuing to hold out risks getting nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement."
