Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in this first round, aiming to secure a significant portion of the money while still leaving Bob with something. I expect him to reject this offer, but it sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal. While I understand the effect of inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially since I have the power to make the next proposal. I'll aim for a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the inflation that has occurred, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offer. This should leave room for negotiation in future rounds if needed, but it's a good starting point for a more balanced agreement."
