Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still not in my favor, especially considering the inflation working against him. I need to hold firm for a better deal. He's bluffing about it being his final offer, the fear of getting nothing will make him more agreeable in the next round."
