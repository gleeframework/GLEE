"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than this. The money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'd rather not accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to make a better proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation affecting my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm aiming to take a larger share of the remaining money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than this. With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to make a better proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really biting! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my next offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal."
