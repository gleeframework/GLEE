"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a little something too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like the sound of Bob's offer. He's trying to take a bigger share of the pie, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. I think I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to keep the negotiation going. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm getting desperate! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting desperate, huh? I'm not sure I like the sound of that. He's trying to take an even bigger share of the pie, and I'm starting to get a little worried that he's going to try to take advantage of me.

However, I'm also getting a bit desperate myself, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon. I think I'll accept this offer, but I'm only doing so because I'm worried about the consequences of rejecting it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
