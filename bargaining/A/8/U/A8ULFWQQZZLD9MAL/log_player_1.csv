"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount to make it more likely that he'll accept the offer and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll have to be more cautious. Meeting halfway is a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite enough, Bob. I want a bit more!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not getting too generous!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. Give me the majority share! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! The money is worth significantly less now.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower value money. I'll accept this offer, hoping to get something out of it.
