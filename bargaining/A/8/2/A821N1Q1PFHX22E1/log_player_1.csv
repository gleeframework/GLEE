"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can reassess later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we can revisit the division later if we need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates in mind, I think Bob's proposal is a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. Can we try for a 55/45 split?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise at 55/45, but I'll give you a slight edge to move closer to the 60/40 you suggested. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
