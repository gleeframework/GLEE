"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30.  It's a good offer for you in early rounds. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's early in the game, and while $30 is something, I can likely get a better deal later on, especially as the money loses value for Alice faster than for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, since the value of the money is decreasing faster for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation, but your offer was too low. How about $65 for me and $35 for you?  It's a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is better than round 1, I'm still seeing if I can get a better deal in the future.  Alice is losing more value per round, and I'm hoping to capitalize on that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 70/30 in my favor.  This should be a good deal for both of us, as the money is losing value rapidly.  Let's agree now before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  My last offer was already a compromise. I'm now at $60 for me, and $40 for you.  This is fair considering the inflation working against you. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

With inflation working against me so quickly, I need to accept this offer. Even though it's not ideal, it's better than getting nothing in the end."
