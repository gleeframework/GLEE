"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I think it's a bit better than my initial offer. However, I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up much more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still not as generous as his offer in round 2. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I still want a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I think it's a good opportunity to accept and get something out of the deal. I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting an even worse deal.
