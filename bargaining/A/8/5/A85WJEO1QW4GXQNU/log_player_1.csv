Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. While the money is losing value for me, I'm willing to share a larger portion to reach a deal sooner. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
