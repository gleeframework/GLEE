"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 3:2 ratio seems fair, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round, accepting this offer now means losing out on potentially more money in the future.  It's better to see what Alice offers in subsequent rounds to potentially get a better deal."
