"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation situation.  It's my turn to make a proposal next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for Bob's potential greed. I'm still hoping to reach a quick resolution, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of.  Let's see if Bob is more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unreasonable, and the inflation is starting to affect him significantly. I'm going to keep rejecting his proposals and see if he finally realizes he needs to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds and the potential for both of us to get nothing. Hopefully, Bob will finally see the value in reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still completely unreasonable, and the inflation is really starting to hurt him. I'm going to keep rejecting his proposals and see if he'll finally come to his senses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair.  Time is running out, and I need to find a way to reach a deal before the inflation completely erodes the value of the money.  Hopefully, Bob will finally start to see that he needs to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfair, and he's clearly not taking the inflation seriously enough.  I'm going to keep rejecting his offers and hope he finally realizes that we both need to make concessions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The pressure is mounting.  We're getting dangerously close to the end, and I'm worried that we'll both end up with nothing.  This is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option considering the circumstances.  Hopefully, Bob will see reason and accept it."
