Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced by your initial offer. I'll give you a fair 50/50 split, but I'm not willing to give you more than that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
