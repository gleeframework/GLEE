Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 45

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's the best I can likely get at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me with each round. Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller potential gain even if Bob were to agree to a slightly better split.
* **Bob's position:** Bob seems firm on getting at least $45 and likely won't budge much further.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting the $55 locks in a decent amount, even with the inflation. Rejecting it risks getting a much smaller amount in a potential final round, with no guarantee Bob will be more generous."
