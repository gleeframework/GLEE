Bob is taking advantage of my decreasing returns, but I still have leverage. This offer is barely better than his last one, and far less than I'd accept at this stage."

``` 

This is a tough one, but I have to accept. 

Bob is being stubborn and clearly hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I could get if he flips my offer around again in Round 7. The longer this goes on, the worse my returns get. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure win, even if it means Bob gets a slightly better deal."
