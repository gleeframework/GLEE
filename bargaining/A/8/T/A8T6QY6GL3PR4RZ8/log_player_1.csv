"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm offering a split closer to the middle. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has already decreased!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money has decreased by another 5% for me, and Bob's share is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""You didn't accept my previous offer, so I'll try to adjust the split. Will you reconsider?""
}
```

I'm trying to balance the split and give Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
