Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** Bob's money is worth 36% less, meaning he'll get 64% of the original value of his offer. Alice's money is worth 9.75% less, meaning she'll get 90.25% of the original value of her offer. 
* **Calculating Value:**
    * Bob's offer: 650,000 * 0.64 = 416,000 (his effective gain)
    * Alice's offer: 350,000 * 0.9025 = 315,875 (her effective gain)
* **Comparison:** If Bob rejects this offer, he has to make a proposal in the next round. This will reduce his money further due to inflation, making it less likely he'll get a better offer than this one. 

It's advantageous for Bob to accept this offer even with the inflation considered."
