Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is reasonable, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:
