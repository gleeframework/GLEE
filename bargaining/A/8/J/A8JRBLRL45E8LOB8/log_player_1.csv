"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 600,000$ and Bob 400,000$. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair start to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of 300,000$ is worth 240,000$ in the previous round's value.

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering the previous round's offer was already a 60-40 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my potential gain of 240,000$ from the previous round is now worth 192,000$.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than 70-30, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable offer. The message is a gentle push to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of 192,000$ from the previous round is now worth 96,000$.

I notice that Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which is actually the same as my previous offer. I'll try to push for a better deal, but I'll also consider the fact that this is the second time Bob has made a 55-45 offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less again, my potential gain of 96,000$ from the previous round is now worth 49,657.60$.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no more haggling""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer, but also a bit of a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. The message is a bit more assertive, suggesting that I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
