Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, accepting now is the most logical choice for Alice:

* **Inflation:** Every round that passes significantly diminishes the value of Alice's potential gain. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome for her, even if she manages to secure a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has indicated he's willing to accept the terms Alice initially proposed. There's no guarantee he'll offer anything better in subsequent rounds, and he's likely aware of the pressure inflation puts on Alice.

It's better for Alice to secure a somewhat favorable deal now than risk getting a much worse deal later due to the relentless inflation."
