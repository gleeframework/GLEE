"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount for now. Consider this a starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. Your turn to reconsider! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be strategic about my next move.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not willing to give up 40% of the remaining money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much, let's try to get closer to 50/50. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will reconsider and offer a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get closer to 50/50, as I mentioned in my previous message.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try to split it 55/45. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 50/50 is a fairer split. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has changed his mind and is now willing to split the money 50/50. I'll consider this offer carefully.

Since the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It's a fair split, and it's better than continuing to negotiate and risk getting an even worse deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
