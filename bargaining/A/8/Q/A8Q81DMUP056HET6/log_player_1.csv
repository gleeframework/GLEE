"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount I'll gain is 45 * 0.95 = 42.75, and Bob will gain 55 * 0.9 = 49.5.

I'm not thrilled with the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
