"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to keep things civil.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me taking $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message is a bit of a gentle jab, trying to set the tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a split that's more equitable for both of us. Let's try 60/40 in my favor.  It's a more balanced starting point. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less, so the actual value of the money I'd get in this offer is $6,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split. I think it's a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's try to find a more balanced split, but I'm not willing to accept this one.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This 70/30 split is a fair starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount of money and keeping Bob happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing with every round. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to end this. Let's avoid any further losses and go with this option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the actual value of the money I'd get in this offer is $5,208.40.

I'm tempted to accept this offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a fair compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give up my negotiating power just yet. Let's see if we can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better one in the next round.""
}
```

I'm trying to hold out for a better offer, but I'm getting a bit nervous about the time constraint."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll make a slight concession to you, but I'm still not willing to go below 60% of the total. This 60/40 split is my final offer for now.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount of money and keeping the door open for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a larger share, but with each round, our potential gains are shrinking. Let's be pragmatic and accept a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to receive a significant portion of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the actual value of the money I'd get in this offer is $2,592.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing. I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, Bob. I accept your offer. A 60/40 split is better than nothing, and I'd rather have $4,000 than risk losing even more value with each passing round.""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer, but I'm not happy about it."
