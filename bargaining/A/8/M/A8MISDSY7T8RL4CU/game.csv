8000.0,2000.0,"Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to keep things civil.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a split that's more equitable for both of us. Let's try 60/40 in my favor.  It's a more balanced starting point.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split. I think it's a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's try to find a more balanced split, but I'm not willing to accept this one.",Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This 70/30 split is a fair starting point, don't you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing with every round. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to end this. Let's avoid any further losses and go with this option.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give up my negotiating power just yet. Let's see if we can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better one in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll make a slight concession to you, but I'm still not willing to go below 60% of the total. This 60/40 split is my final offer for now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for a larger share, but with each round, our potential gains are shrinking. Let's be pragmatic and accept a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to receive a significant portion of the money.",Bob,6,
,,"Fine, Bob. I accept your offer. A 60/40 split is better than nothing, and I'd rather have $4000 than risk losing even more value with each passing round.",Alice,6,accept
