"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%. We can negotiate later if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000 is not bad, it's worth considering that the inflation rate is significant. Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get a better deal in the next round, even with the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that we both have to deal with the inflation. Let's work together to get a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 65/35.  I'm open to negotiation if you want to go back and forth a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer ensures a gain for Bob, which is better than risking further rounds of inflation.  It's also a good compromise from Alice."
