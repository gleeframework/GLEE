# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is running out, and the money is losing value quickly. 52/48 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a higher percentage,  the time pressure and decreasing value of the money make this a good deal."
