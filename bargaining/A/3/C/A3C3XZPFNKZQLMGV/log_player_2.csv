Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 offer as well, but with Bob gaining 60. However, I'll also consider the inflation factor, so I'll make the offer slightly more favorable to myself.

{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, Alice's offer is now more favorable to me. Since it's 50/50, I'll accept the offer to avoid further rounds and potential even more severe inflation.
