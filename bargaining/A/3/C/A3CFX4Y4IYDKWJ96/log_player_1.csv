"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for me, but Bob's offer is the same as the one I made in round 1. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is now worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in the first round, but still keeping a slight edge."
