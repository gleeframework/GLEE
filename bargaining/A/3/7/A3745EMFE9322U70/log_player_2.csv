Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up half the money. Let's split it 45/55 this time. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take it, 55 is more than half, and with inflation, it's better to take it now rather than risk losing more value in the next rounds.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGame over, I guess! Thanks for playing."
