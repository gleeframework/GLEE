"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a more equitable distribution considering the potential of inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
