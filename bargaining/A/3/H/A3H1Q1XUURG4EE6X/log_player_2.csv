Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, but I'm sure we can find a more beneficial split for both of us as we progress.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This accounts for future rounds and the decreasing value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to find a compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's split it evenly this round and see if we can find a better solution moving forward. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the declining value of the money significantly disadvantages me as the rounds progress. I need to aim for a larger share now to compensate for the steeper inflation I face."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and the value is dropping fast.  This offer considers the time pressure.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to concede a bit more, but we need to make sure we both get a fair share.  This offer takes into account the decreasing value, but still gives us both a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this offer is now within a reasonable range, considering the time pressure and the rapid devaluation of the money. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting a worse offer later or even reaching the deadline with no agreement."
