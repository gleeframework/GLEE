I'm going for a generous but assertive opening offer. I'm confident I can get a good chunk of the money, but I don't want to push Bob too hard in the early rounds.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round. A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
