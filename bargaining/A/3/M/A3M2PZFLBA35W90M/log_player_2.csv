Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000.  It's important to divide this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's split things a bit more evenly this time. I propose I take $5,500 and you take $4,500. This way we both benefit from a relatively quick agreement.""

# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're close. To avoid further losses due to inflation, I propose we switch the amounts from your last offer.  I'll take $5,500 and you take $4,500. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
