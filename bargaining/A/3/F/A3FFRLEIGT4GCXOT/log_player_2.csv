"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's early in the game, and I can see if I can get a better deal for myself. I'll reject the offer and see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 400k, but I need a bit more to make this worth my while. Let's see if we can find a way to split this fairly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer the 60/40 split, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. I'll take the 550,000 and move on."
