"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you 400k, but I need a bit more to make this worth my while. Let's see if we can find a way to split this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for Bob, so the offer of $600,000 is actually worth $480,000 in real terms. Meanwhile, I would be getting $400,000, which is still worth $400,000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll decide to reject it for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too generous to him, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $550,000, which is worth $440,000 in real terms, while I'll take $450,000, which is still worth $450,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this more moderate proposal!"
