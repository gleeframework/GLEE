"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. Since we have many rounds left and the value of money decreases, I believe it's beneficial to establish trust and show a willingness to share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is a real factor. I'm not sure how it impacts Bob, but it definitely hurts me. Accepting this offer is the safest option to avoid getting nothing."
