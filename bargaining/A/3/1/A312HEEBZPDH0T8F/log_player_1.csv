"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'll give you $1000 and take $9000. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll want to negotiate and we can make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share right now and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is tempting, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'm not sure if he's thinking strategically about the future.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best idea, considering the inflation. I'll pass for now and hope to do better next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split it evenly, I'm going to try to take a larger share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share this time, but I'm still leaving you with a decent amount. Don't think you can do better than this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than the last round. This offer is fair and avoids further risk from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on Bob's share, I think he's getting more desperate. I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting more aggressive, Bob! I'm not sure I want to give you that much. I'll pass and see what you do next.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at Bob's share, I'll try to take an even bigger slice of the pie. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! I'm taking the biggest share yet. You can either accept or risk losing even more to inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round. This is the best deal you'll get, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and his share is shrinking rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to take advantage of this and get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to the edge, Bob! I'm not convinced this is the best deal for you. I'll pass and see if you can do better next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's share shrinking rapidly due to inflation, I'll try to take an even bigger slice of the pie. Here's my proposal for Round 7:
