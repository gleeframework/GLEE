Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with a 40% share, considering we're just starting the negotiations. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
