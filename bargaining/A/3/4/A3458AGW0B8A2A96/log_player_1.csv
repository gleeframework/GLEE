Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Consider that with each round, the value decreases for me, but remains the same for you. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 700000
