300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Consider that with each round, the value decreases for me, but remains the same for you. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a bit, but a 60/40 split is still fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'm the one making the proposal this round. Take it or leave it!",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is literally evaporating with each round!  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is the same split you offered me, just reversed. Accept it now, before this deal gets any worse... for both of us.",Bob,4,
