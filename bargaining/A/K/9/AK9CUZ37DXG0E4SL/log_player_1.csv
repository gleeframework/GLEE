Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more considering the potential for future gains. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I believe this split is more fair considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this game now.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the potential for future gains. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up yet. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I prefer a larger share, the inflation makes it risky to continue. This offer is still a decent gain considering the circumstances, and I'm unsure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
