"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and take most of the money. I figure Bob might accept since it's better than nothing, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor and want to get as much as I can before it kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, it's clear that Bob is willing to split the money evenly now that I have been rejected once. I don't know how much the inflation will affect Bob, but I'm willing to take the 500,000 now, since the next round would be worth 10% less for me and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything then."
