"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. It's more than fair considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800

""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is really hurting your share. I think it's time for a 60/40 split. You're not getting any better offers from me, so consider accepting this one. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I'll accept the 60/40 split. It's better than walking away with nothing, and the inflation is only going to get worse.""
}
``` 
 
Even though it's Bob's initial offer and not ideal, the inflation is significantly eating into Alice's potential gains. Accepting now guarantees her something, whereas continuing to decline offers could lead to a much worse outcome in the later rounds."
