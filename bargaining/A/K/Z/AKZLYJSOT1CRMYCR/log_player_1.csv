"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to Round 2!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to get a better share to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I need a bit more to account for inflation!""
}
