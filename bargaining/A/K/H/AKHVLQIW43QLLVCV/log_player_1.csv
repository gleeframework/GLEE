Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to maximize my share while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm losing value with every round, Bob's offer is ridiculously unfair, especially considering his offer was rejected in the previous round.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking losing all the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try a slightly less aggressive offer than round 1, but still aim for a larger share.  The inflation is making things more difficult, but I'm hoping to make a compromise that Bob will find acceptable."

```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and the inflation is really starting to bite. However, I'm still going to reject this offer. I'm willing to risk losing everything, but I'm not going to accept such an unfair deal.  I'm going to try to hold out for something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite, and Bob's offers are getting worse and worse. I'm still going to reject this offer, though. It's still not fair, and I'm willing to risk getting nothing at all rather than settle for such an unfair deal.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

The inflation is really starting to hurt now, and I'm getting desperate.  I'm going to try a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and equitable offer, and I hope Bob will finally accept it."
