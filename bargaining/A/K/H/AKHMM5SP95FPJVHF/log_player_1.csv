"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. That seems like the most fair way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Even split is too generous for me, considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an even split, considering the money is worth less for me than for Bob in each round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my previous offer. Still a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to 55-45 in my favor, taking into account the 5% decrease in the value of the money for me and the 10% decrease for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both be willing to compromise a bit more. Let's aim for a split that's fair to both of us, given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still not willing to give up that much. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially considering the significant inflation that's reduced the value of the money for me. I'll wait for a more favorable offer from Bob."

}
```

I've adjusted the split to 52-48 in my favor, taking into account the continued inflation and trying to find a balance that's acceptable to both of us."
