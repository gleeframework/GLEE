Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we have a limited number of rounds""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, a little more to me 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all, especially with the inflation factor."
