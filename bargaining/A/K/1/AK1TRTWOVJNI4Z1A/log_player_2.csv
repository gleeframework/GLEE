**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal. With 7 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate, but I need to be prepared to accept a less favorable offer as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. A straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

By now, Alice should realize I'm not backing down easily.  Offering a 50/50 split seems fair, and it puts the pressure on her. It shows I'm willing to compromise but not be taken advantage of.  This could be my last firm offer before I start considering less favorable splits to avoid getting nothing."
