"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you still get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a lot of money, but there's a good chance I can get more in later rounds, especially with the inflation affecting Alice more heavily."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split considering the inflation we're facing. I'm willing to take a slight risk, but I believe we can both benefit more in the long run.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to secure a larger portion to make up for the inflation.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a better offer than the previous round, Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll try to negotiate a better split for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""We're both losing money with each round.  I'm offering you a fair split that accounts for the inflation. Let's agree on this and avoid further losses.""}
