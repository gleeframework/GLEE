"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer, but still a good one. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth 320,000 in real terms, and Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 570,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but Bob's message suggests he's trying to be generous. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'll take a bigger slice this time.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to make up for the lost value due to inflation. This offer is a bit more aggressive, but still fair. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 480,000 is actually worth approximately 251,200 in real terms, and Bob's gain of 520,000 is worth around 446,800.

While Bob's offer is still a bit aggressive, it seems like he's trying to make up for the lost value. I'll think carefully...
