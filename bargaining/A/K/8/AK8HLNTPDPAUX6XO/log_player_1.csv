"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite one-sided! I'm not thrilled about giving up 7,000$ to him. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between keeping a decent amount for myself while still giving Bob a significant share."
