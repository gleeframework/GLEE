"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900k/100k split. I'm going for a big chunk, knowing that inflation will impact the value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer means I'll still get something, and the next round is likely to be even worse for me due to inflation."
