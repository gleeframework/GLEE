"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess if we don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm starting with a fair and simple proposal, and we can adjust from there if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, and I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

I decide to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has taken a bigger toll on Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to negotiate a fair deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being willing to take a risk and potentially get less 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the significant decrease in value, I need to be careful about accepting an offer that might leave me with a relatively small amount.

However, Bob's message about taking a risk and potentially getting less makes me think that he might be willing to compromise. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons...

I decide to accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
