"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll give you a slight edge for being the one to make the first offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a little greedy in round 1, let's try to be fair this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to call me out on being greedy!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a very fair one. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
