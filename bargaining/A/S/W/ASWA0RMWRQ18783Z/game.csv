700000.0,300000.0,Let's split the money with a 70/30 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the risk involved.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  It still leaves you with a substantial amount while giving me a chance to make more in future rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose an equal split to avoid any potential future conflicts. This way, both of us benefit equally from this round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
