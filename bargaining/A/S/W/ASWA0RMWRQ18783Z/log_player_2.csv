"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money with a 70/30 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the risk involved. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 300,000$ gain is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation will make future rounds less profitable for me.  Let's see what I can negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  It still leaves you with a substantial amount while giving me a chance to make more in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split to avoid any potential future conflicts. This way, both of us benefit equally from this round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred a better deal, I'm worried about the inflation affecting future rounds.  An even split is a fair outcome considering the risk of getting nothing at all in future rounds."
