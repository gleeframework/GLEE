"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer, as it's a perfectly even split. While the value of the money will decrease with each round, there's no guarantee that Alice will be willing to offer such a generous split again."
