"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take $2,000 and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to take $5,000."
