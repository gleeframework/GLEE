"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not sure why you offered me such a small share last round. I think it's fair to split this 60/40, with me taking the larger share. We both get a decent amount, and I believe it's a good starting point for a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
