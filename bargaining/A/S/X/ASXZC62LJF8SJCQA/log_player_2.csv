Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  While the deal is getting worse, I'm not desperate enough to accept a deal where I get significantly less than half.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and value. I'm being generous. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't great, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to hold out.  Alice knows time is on her side and is unlikely to offer anything better.  It's time to cut my losses and accept."
