Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. It's a much better deal for you than the last round, and we can both walk away with a decent sum.  Think about it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
