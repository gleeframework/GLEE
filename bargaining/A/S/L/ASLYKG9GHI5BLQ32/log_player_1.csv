Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000$ for myself and leave 100,000$ for Bob. Let's see if he accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more money, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, and I don't want to risk losing everything due to inflation."
