"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a better solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm looking for a better deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate further. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
