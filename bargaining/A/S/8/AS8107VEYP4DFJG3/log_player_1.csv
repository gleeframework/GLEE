Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more even split is fairer.  Let's work together to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's analyze why rejecting is the strategic move:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value for me with each round. Accepting Bob's offer now means I get $450,000, which is already worth 10% less than it was in Round 1.
* **Long-Term Strategy:** Bob is likely aware of the inflation working against me. By rejecting, I signal I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate for a better deal.  
* **Future Leverage:** In the next round, I propose the division. This gives me leverage to push for a larger share, considering the increasing pressure of inflation on my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this scenario.  I'm willing to meet in the middle, but this offer needs to reflect the urgency.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Slightly:** I've reduced my initial ask from $550,000 to $520,000. This shows a willingness to compromise but still prioritizes my interests.
* **Highlighting Urgency:** Reminding Bob about the inflation emphasizes that every round wasted costs me potential gains. This might incentivize him to settle sooner.
* **Seeking a Balance:** This offer aims to strike a balance between getting a larger share than Bob offered and securing a deal before inflation further eats into my potential gains."
