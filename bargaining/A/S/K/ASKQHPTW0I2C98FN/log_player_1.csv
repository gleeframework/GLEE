"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming to secure a quick agreement.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him, considering he only loses 5% of the value per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a fair split. With the inflation, holding out for more might risk getting nothing at all. It's better to secure a decent amount now."
