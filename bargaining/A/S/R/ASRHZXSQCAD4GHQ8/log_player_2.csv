# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain. Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but I believe holding out a little longer could still lead to a better outcome, even with the inflation."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it, or I'm sticking to my guns and hoping for the best in the later rounds.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the value is decreasing rapidly.  While 48/52 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse offer from Alice in the later rounds where the inflation will hurt even more.  This offer signals a sense of urgency and firmness, potentially pushing Alice to accept."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting close to the end, don't risk losing it all 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The end is near, and the inflation is killing any potential gains.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better now. It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting this slightly worse offer is better than risking a complete loss in the final rounds."
