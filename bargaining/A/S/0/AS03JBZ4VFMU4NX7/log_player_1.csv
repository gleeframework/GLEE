Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share and we don't have to worry about the money losing value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
