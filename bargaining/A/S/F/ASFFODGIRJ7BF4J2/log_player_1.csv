I'm going to be greedy and take almost all of the money. Since Bob's money is worth less with each round, he has a strong incentive to take anything at all.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While 100,000 is a decent amount, I can still get more than that. I'm going to reject this offer and see what happens in the next round. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but I'm still going to try and maximize my share.  I'm going to offer him a slightly better deal than last round, but still keep the majority of the money for myself."
