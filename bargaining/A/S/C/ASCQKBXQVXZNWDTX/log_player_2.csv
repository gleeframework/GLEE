"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me since the money devalues faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money devalues faster for me, I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the devaluation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the devaluation affects you, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile.  This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round. Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal that takes into account the devaluation of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the growing impact of inflation, I believe this split better reflects the urgency for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. A perfectly even split is the fairest option considering the time pressure and inflation. We both lose if we don't agree now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual value of the money considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, the actual value of my gain would be 5000 * 0.8145 = 4072.50.\n\nGiven the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money for me, I think accepting this offer is the best option. Further negotiations might lead to an even lower value for me due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her offer."
