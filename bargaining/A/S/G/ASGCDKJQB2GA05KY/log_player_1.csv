"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's a fair start, but I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50$ is now worth 50% less, so it's actually 25$.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best strategy, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer should be a bit more aggressive to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You said meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm offering 60$ now, which is worth 30% of the initial 100$, and Bob would get 40$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 40, let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40$ is now worth 27.1% less, so it's actually around 29.27$.

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to put pressure on me to make a better offer. I'll try to outmaneuver him.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to make a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of 40$ is now worth around 29.27$, and I need to consider that the money will continue to decrease in value.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid to take a risk, I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm offering 55$ now, which is worth around 27.55% of the initial 100$, and Bob would get 45$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on 65, but I'm willing to make it a serious offer, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 35$ is now worth around 19.05$.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's getting more aggressive and is trying to make a ""take it or leave it"" offer. I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority of the money.

However, I also don't want to risk going into the final rounds with a smaller share. I'll take the 35$ and hope that the inflation doesn't get too out of control.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get."
