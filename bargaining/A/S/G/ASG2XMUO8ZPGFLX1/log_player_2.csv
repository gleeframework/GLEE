Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, this offer is better than the previous round's offer (after inflation, Alice's offer is worth 900,000 * 0.9025 = $812,250 and I would be getting $100,000 * 0.64 = $64,000 which is more than the previous round's offer of $900,000 * 0.64 = $576,000 for Alice and $100,000 * 0.64 = $64,000 for me).  It's a good idea to accept this offer as the next round will have further inflation."
