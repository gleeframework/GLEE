"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable to start. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject the offer.  It's a reasonable starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I also want to make sure I get a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I think a 52/48 split is fairer, given that I'm the one taking the risk of rejection. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective. How about we meet in the middle with a 52/48 split in my favor? 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer.  While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing to reject.  It's better to get a decent amount now than to wait and potentially lose everything."
