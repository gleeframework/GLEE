"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $400,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting! My potential gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's offer, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob! I'll take 42% and leave you with 58%""
