"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to take that into account.

Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is lower than the 50/50 split I initially proposed. I'll consider this offer and decide to reject it, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Given that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous round. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less, I need to be careful.

Bob's offer is a 30/70 split, which is a very unfavorable split for me. I'm not getting desperate, but I do need to consider the decreasing value of the money. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll need to be even more strategic. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth even less, I'll aim for a more favorable split.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to think about my own interests. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous round. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, you're running out of time 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains worth significantly less, I need to be extremely cautious.

Bob's offer is a 20/80 split, which is a very unfavorable split for me. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The final round! With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll need to make a very strategic decision. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth a tiny fraction of its original value, I'll aim for a very favorable split.

Here's my final offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""It's now or never. I'm taking what I can get.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 10/90 split, which is the most extreme split I've offered so far. I'm essentially giving Bob the majority of the remaining value, but I'm taking what I can get to salvage what's left. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
