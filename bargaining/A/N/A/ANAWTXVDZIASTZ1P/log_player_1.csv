I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, and although I'm losing value with each round, I'm not going to give up 90% of the money this early on.  I'll make my counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  This offer is still favorable to me, but it shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still extremely unfavorable. I'm losing more value with each round, but I'm not willing to give up that much money yet. I'll counter with a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can still get a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor, despite the inflation. I'm losing a lot of value with each passing round, but I can't give up so much right now. I'm still holding out for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making another concession, but I'm still trying to get a larger share. We're nearing the middle of the game, and inflation is really starting to bite. I need to find a way to close the deal before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, it's still too far in his favor. The inflation is making this game very difficult, but I'm not ready to settle for such a small share of the money yet. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With less than half the rounds remaining and the inflation hitting hard, I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the fairest offer I can make while still getting a decent share of the money. I hope Bob finally sees reason and accepts this deal."
