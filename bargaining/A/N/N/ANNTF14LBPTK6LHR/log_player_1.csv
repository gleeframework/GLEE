"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80 and you get 20.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me taking the larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have all the fun, Alice! I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a better deal than 20%. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I don't think I'll accept Bob's offer. With the 20% inflation, the $10 I'd get is actually worth only $8 in real terms, and Bob would get $90, which is worth $72 in real terms. That's a pretty lopsided split in his favor. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50-50 seems fair, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to balance out the effects of inflation and give Bob a more attractive offer."
