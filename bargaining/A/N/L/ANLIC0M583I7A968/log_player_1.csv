"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, where we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, but I'm not impressed!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only 20% of the money. It's a bit too one-sided for my taste. Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not being too greedy. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small token of appreciation, but I'm still the one who deserves the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous with a ""small token of appreciation"", but I'm not buying it!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Getting only $100,000 is laughable. I'm not going to accept an offer where I get less than 10% of the money. It's time for Bob to think bigger!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another move!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share for my patience.""
}
```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who's being generous 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, but this offer is still way too one-sided!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Getting only $250,000 is not even close to a fair share. I'm not going to accept an offer where I get less than 25% of the money. It's time for Bob to think more seriously about compromise!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm trying to assert my dominance in this negotiation, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to get something. Let's see if he's willing to accept a smaller share!"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who's being generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still too one-sided! I'm not going to accept an offer where I get less than 30% of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm starting to think that Bob is not serious about finding a fair deal. It's time to make another strong offer and see if he's willing to compromise!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give in completely 
# Alice gain: 400000
