Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing that I get $9,000, and Bob gets $1,000.  It's a pretty generous offer for a first round!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, it's better to get $4,000 than risk getting nothing in the next round."
