"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
