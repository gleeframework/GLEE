Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but this split accounts for the time pressure on your side.  Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure.  I'm willing to meet you halfway to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob is framing his offer as ""meeting halfway,"" it's essential to look at the bigger picture:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation disproportionately hurts me. 
* **Bob's Advantage:** Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely, and he's likely using this to his advantage.

I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away from a bad deal, even with the time pressure."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but this needs to reflect the increasing pressure on my end. Let's be realistic and wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm reducing my demand slightly to signal a willingness to negotiate, but...
* **Firm Stance:** The offer still strongly favors me to counter the accelerating inflation disadvantage. 
* **Direct Tone:**  I'm calling out the situation clearly to remind Bob I'm aware of the power dynamics."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We're running out of time, and it's not beneficial for either of us to drag this on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the inflation is eating significantly into potential gains.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds isn't worth the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to agree. 
* **Fair Offer on the Surface:** A 50/50 split seems fair in principle, and while the inflation impacts me more, taking the sure thing now is the most logical choice at this point."
