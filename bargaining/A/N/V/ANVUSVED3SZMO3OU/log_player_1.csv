"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob an equal share of 50% of the $10,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob! 

I'll consider the offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll take into account the reduced value of Bob's share.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in Round 3!"

  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! Let's meet in the middle again.""

```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"

Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu! Bob is suggesting a 50/50 split again. I've already rejected a similar offer in Round 1, but I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with inflation eating away at the money."
