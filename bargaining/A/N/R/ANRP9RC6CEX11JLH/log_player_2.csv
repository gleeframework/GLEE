"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take a majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice.  While getting something is better than nothing, I have time to negotiate a much fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This offer accounts for the time pressure on you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Inflation is a factor, but we both need to make progress. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I could push for a slightly better deal in the next round, the effects of inflation are becoming significant for Alice. An even split is fair and guarantees a good outcome for me."
