"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping that he'll be eager to accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it roughly evenly, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is less appealing than it seems. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my share of $4,000 is still a significant amount. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer this time, but still a good deal for me""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still keeping a bit more than Bob. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a 50/50 split, it's worth a shot 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, Bob's offer is now even less appealing than before. The fact that he's offering a 50/50 split is interesting, but I'm not sure if it's genuine or just a ploy to get me to accept a lower share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly again, but still keeping a bit more than Bob. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, but I'm not willing to give up too much."

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, Bob's offer is now even less attractive than before. The fact that he's willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a 50/50 split is a good sign, but I'm not sure if he's willing to go all the way.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

Round 7

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm still willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but not by as much as I was in the previous round. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, but I'm still keeping a bit more than him."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I think we can find a better split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns and offering the same split as in Round 2, but with even less value due to inflation. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one.

However, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.
