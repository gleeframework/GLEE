I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good chunk of money.  But, I want to make sure I get the lion's share since I'm the one making the first move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much more generous than my first offer, but it's still not quite good enough. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than he offered me, but I'm still giving him a good amount. I hope this shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  I've already rejected a couple of his offers, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round. Plus, with the inflation, I'm losing a significant amount of money each round.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
