6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's find a more balanced split considering the inflation rate works against both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the attempt at balance, Bob, this offer still disproportionately favors you given the faster rate of inflation applied to my potential gains. Let's try to find a fairer compromise.",Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, my previous offer was a starting point for negotiation. I'm adjusting it slightly to reflect the time pressure, but a fair split is crucial. Let's agree and avoid losing even more value.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we are running out of time. This offer is a compromise to end this quickly and fairly before inflation eats away at the value. ",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the need to reach an agreement soon. However, your proposed split still does not adequately consider the faster rate of inflation impacting my share. I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be a fair deal for both of us.",Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the rapid inflation working against me. Let's close the deal now before we both lose out.",Alice,5,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay, Bob, I accept. A 50/50 split it is. It's not ideal, but it's better than both of us walking away with nothing.",Alice,6,accept
