"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 950,000$ for myself and give Bob 50,000$. This seems like a fair first offer, as it ensures I get the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, rather than risk seeing the money devalued by inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I would have been happy with the offer from the previous round, it's clear Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 and keeping 700,000 for myself. This is a compromise that still allows me to gain a significant portion of the money. While inflation is a factor, I believe this offer is still fair given the previous round's rejection."
