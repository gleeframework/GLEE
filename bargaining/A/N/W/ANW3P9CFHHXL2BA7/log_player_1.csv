"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message saying ""Let's divide fairly"".\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness. Let's split it equally while it's still worth something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think Bob's offer is reasonable, considering the inflation. Splitting the money equally is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round.\n\nLet's end the game here!"
