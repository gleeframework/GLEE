"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I propose a division where you receive $25 in the first round. This might not seem fair now, but it could become more advantageous for you in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth considering the inflation rates and the potential to gain more in later rounds.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counter-proposal in the next round, potentially securing a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I understand the value of money decreases with each round, I'm willing to offer a fair deal that accounts for our respective inflation rates. Let's agree on this and avoid further negotiation.""}
