"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to be fair.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to reassess the offer.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 80% of the original $600,000 I was offered in Round 1. That's a good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
