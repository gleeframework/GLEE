{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, my gain of 45 is actually worth 36 dollars, and Bob's gain of 55 is worth 49.5 dollars. I think I can do better than that. I reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
