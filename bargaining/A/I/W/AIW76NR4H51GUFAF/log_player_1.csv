"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, wouldn't you agree? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be strategic. However, splitting it evenly seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
