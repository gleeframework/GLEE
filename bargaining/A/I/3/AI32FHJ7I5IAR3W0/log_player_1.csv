{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me only $4,000 while taking $6,000 for himself seems unfair. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. While he's trying to make it more equal, I'm still not getting a fair share. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me $5,800 while taking $4,200 for himself seems like I'm still getting the short end of the stick. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."

# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think it's getting late in the game, and I'm running out of options. While I was hoping for a more even split, I'm willing to accept this offer since it's getting closer to a 50/50 split. I'll take the $6,200 and hope that it's enough to make it worth my while."
