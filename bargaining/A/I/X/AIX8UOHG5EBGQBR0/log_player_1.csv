"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small share to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. My gain is worth 5% less, so I need to think carefully about the proposal. I'll reject Bob's offer for now. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share now. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This way, I'm aiming to get a higher share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the reduced value of my share, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is the same as the previous one, and my gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
