Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still think my initial offer was closer to fair. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, and while the effects of inflation aren't huge yet, they'll become more significant with each round. It's important to signal I'm willing to walk away from a bad deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the urgency, but I still believe my share should be higher. I'm willing to compromise, but let's not rush into an unfair deal. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. Alice is being very stubborn, and the inflation is starting to really hurt.  Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** 430,000 is significantly less than my original counter-offer.
* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose.  Another rejection means I'm dealing with close to a 70% loss by the time I get to propose again.
* **Alice's Behavior:** She doesn't seem to be budging much. There's a chance she'll hold out hoping I get desperate.

This is a gamble. I think there's a slim chance Alice might be open to a slightly better deal, but it's risky. 

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  I need to signal I'm serious about a fair split. One more rejection might make her realize I'm not going to cave easily.  However, I need to be prepared to make a significant concession in the next round if she doesn't budge."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is as far as I can go.  We both lose if we don't agree now.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  This is a calculated risk.  I'm presenting a final offer that's a slight improvement on her last but still favors her.  This signals that I'm serious about ending the negotiations.
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and inflation is rapidly eroding our gains.  I need to apply pressure and force a decision.
* **Potential Outcomes:** 
    * **Best Case:** Alice realizes I'm serious and accepts.
    * **Worst Case:** Alice rejects, and I'm forced to accept a worse deal in the next round or risk getting nothing.  However, even in the worst case, it's unlikely I'd get a better deal than this from her."
