"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

 I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with a symbolic amount. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I figure Bob is likely to reject this offer, giving me the opportunity to propose again in the next round.  This way, I can use the inflation to my advantage in the next round, and hopefully get a more favourable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Bob's offer gives me a substantial amount, and the inflation could mean I lose more if I reject and try to negotiate further.  It's better to secure a good portion now than risk getting nothing later."
