Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting us both, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but let's keep it reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I still think I can get a better deal, considering Alice is losing more value to inflation than I am. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed hitting us both, but I believe I can manage the loss better. Let's try this division.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a difficult situation for both of us, Bob. Let's be realistic and settle for a division close to what we both proposed before the inflation significantly hurts us. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI think this is a reasonable offer considering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice's side. Continuing further might risk losing more value than I can potentially gain. I'll accept this offer to secure my share."
