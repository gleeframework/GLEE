"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. The message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"". Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the inflation for future rounds.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, but I'm open to negotiation.   
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, I will reject this offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. I'll make a new proposal in the next round, taking into consideration the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when to send my next proposal.\n\n###\n\n(My next proposal will be relayed once you confirm.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine, I will make a new proposal. Since Bob's money is worth 5% less in each round, and we are now in Round 3, Bob's money is worth 10% less than in the initial round (5% decrease in Round 2 and another 5% decrease in Round 3).\n\n###\n\nI'll propose a division that takes this into account but still appears favorable to both parties.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this seems fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000, with the message to Bob being ""Considering inflation, this seems fair"". Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\n(I'll continue to track the inflation for future rounds.)\n\n###\n\nAlso, note that while I'm trying to negotiate fairly considering the game's mechanics, my primary goal is to maximize my gain as per the game's objective.\n\n###\n\nWaiting for Bob's response..."
