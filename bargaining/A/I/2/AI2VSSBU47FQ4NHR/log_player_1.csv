"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. I'm trying to be generous, but also taking into account that the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I want a bigger share to offset inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it gives him a larger share than I'm willing to accept. I'll reject it and make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous""
}


I've increased my share slightly, while still offering Bob a decent amount, taking into account that the money is worth even less to him now due to inflation. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit less, but still need more due to inflation 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. Although he's taking a bit less, I think I can do better, considering the significant impact of inflation on his share. I'll reject it and make another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you hard, I'll take a bit more""
}


I've increased my share again, as the inflation is really reducing the value of the money for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as it's getting less worthwhile for him to hold out."
