Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  We are both losing money with each round. A 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but it's still not in my favor given the rate at which his share is devaluing. I need to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are both losing money. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to get this done. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

Bob's offer is now acceptable.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the rate of inflation is working against him more than me. Accepting now guarantees a good outcome before his share devalues further."
