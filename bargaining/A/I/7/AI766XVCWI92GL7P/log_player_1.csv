"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not getting 1/8th of the total 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 in this round is actually worth $240,000 (80% of $300,000). Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth $630,000 (90% of $700,000).

I don't think this offer is very generous, especially since I'm getting a significantly smaller share. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $450,000 is worth 48.8% of the original amount, which is $484,000 (0.488 * $1,000,000).
