I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm only losing 10% per round, while Bob loses 20%. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a significant share while still giving me a good head start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. While the offer is only 50/50, it's important to consider the inflation factor. I'd be losing another 10% of my value if I reject and we move on to the next round. It's better to take a fair offer now rather than risk getting a worse one later."
