"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. I'll take the risk of negotiating further if you don't accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think we can find a more equitable split. 60-40 in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, but with a different spin on the message.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. 54-46 split in my favor. Don't expect it to get any better.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000, which is a slightly smaller share than before, and keeping $540,000 for myself."
