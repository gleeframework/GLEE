Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively high offer for myself, but still leave a small amount for Bob.  This way, I can see if he's willing to accept even a small share, or if he's going to try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to accept a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
