Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need a good chunk to make it worth my while.  55/45 seems like a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
