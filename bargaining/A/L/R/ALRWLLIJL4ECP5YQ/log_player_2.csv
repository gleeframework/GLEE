"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping you'll be reasonable and accept. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 20% share.  Let's see if Alice is willing to be more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share due to the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's getting late in the game and I'm not sure I can get a better offer.  Let's take this and hopefully avoid getting nothing."
