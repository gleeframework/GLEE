"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept early on. This way, we both get something, and I avoid the risk of further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While I would gain something, the inflation rate means my gain would be worth significantly less than in the previous round. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, especially considering Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, aiming for a middle ground. Inflation is becoming a major factor, and I want to secure a substantial amount before the value diminishes further. This offer balances fairness with the need for a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While my gain is better than in the last round, it's still significantly lower than what I'd get in the previous round after inflation. It's important to remember that inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, so I'm hoping to capitalize on that by holding out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time.  With the high inflation rate, both of us need to agree quickly to secure a decent amount.  This offer acknowledges the significant disadvantage Bob is facing and allows him to gain a larger share while still providing me with a substantial sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not satisfactory.  While my gains are higher than in the previous round, inflation has significantly eroded the value of this offer.  I believe there is still room for a more balanced agreement that better reflects the current inflation rates. I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation continuing to escalate, the need for an agreement is becoming critical. This offer proposes an equal split, acknowledging the diminishing value of the money and offering Bob a fair share to potentially incentivize him to accept."
