"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to account for inflation, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about Bob getting a slightly larger share. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""A slight compromise, let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a compromise, where I get a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for Bob to get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'd like a bit more. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob getting a larger share again, especially with the inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money. However, I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer.

I'll think about it...

Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. But I don't want to give up too much either.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be satisfied with the result.
