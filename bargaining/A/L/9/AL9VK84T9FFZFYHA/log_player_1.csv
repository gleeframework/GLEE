"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll consider the fact that Bob's offer is worth 20% less than the original $1,000,000, but the value of my gain remains the same.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is still worth 20% less for Bob, but I'm being generous by giving him a slightly smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer, considering the 48.8% decrease in value due to inflation.

Bob's gain in Round 4 is worth 540,000 / (1 - 0.488) = 540,000 / 0.512 = 1,054,688 in original value.

This is a very generous offer from Bob, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
