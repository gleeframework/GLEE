I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob a small portion to see if he's willing to accept early on.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm not giving up 7000 dollars easily!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still trying to get a fair share. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that he needs to compromise to get anything at all.  Let's see if this is enough to convince him."
