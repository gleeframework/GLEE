Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'll offer Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's tempting to hold out for more, Bob's offer is fair and it guarantees me a significant amount of money. The risk of getting nothing in later rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly larger share."
