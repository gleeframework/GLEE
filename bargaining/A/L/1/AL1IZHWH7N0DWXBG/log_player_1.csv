This is a fair starting point, as it splits the money almost equally. However, I'm aware of the inflation rates and will keep them in mind for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to the initial split, the inflation rates are working against me. I need to be more assertive and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to 55. This takes into account the inflation that's hitting Bob more heavily."
