4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems more reasonable than your initial offer.  What do you think?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, let's compromise.  I'll take 5500, you get 4500.  This is a fairer split, considering inflation.  If you reject this, we'll be stuck with less money in the next round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"How about a 52/48 split in my favor? The value of the money is decreasing for both of us, so we need to find a compromise quickly to maximize our gains.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"We're both losing money with each round. Let's split the difference this time, 50/50.  If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with nothing.",Alice,5,
