"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 40 is actually 40% of the current value of the money.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to decide, Bob!""
}
```

This way, I get 55% of the current value of the money, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, are you ready to give up now?! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than its original value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

I'm getting desperate, but I still want to try to get a better deal. However, this offer is quite close to the final round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less after the fifth round of inflation, I'll have to be even more careful with my offer.

Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic now. Let's split it as close to 50/50 as we can get at this point.""
}
```

This way, I'm accepting that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly and trying to get a fair share of what's left."
