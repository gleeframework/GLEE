Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unfair, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share even more.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take 55% and you get 45%. This is a fair split considering the inflation, and we can avoid going through more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
