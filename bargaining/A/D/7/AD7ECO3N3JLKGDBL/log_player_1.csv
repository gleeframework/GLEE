"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a bigger share, huh?

I'll think about it... With the 10% inflation, my gain of $20 is now worth $18.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving Bob 80% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer.

I'm proposing a 45% share for myself and 55% for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob 65% of the remaining money, but I'm not sure I can do better. I'll think about it...

I'll accept this offer.
