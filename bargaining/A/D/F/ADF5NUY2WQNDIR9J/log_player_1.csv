"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me 700,000 and Bob 300,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the reduced gains due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After re-evaluating, I think I can live with a 60-40 split. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
