"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This means I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000. It's a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'm actually better off accepting Bob's offer this time. I'll take the $4,000 and we can end the game here.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
