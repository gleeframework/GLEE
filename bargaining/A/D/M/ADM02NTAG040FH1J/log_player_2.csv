Let's see what I can do with my own offer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, I'm willing to compromise, but still need a slightly bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. It's better to take what I can get now before it's worth even less."
