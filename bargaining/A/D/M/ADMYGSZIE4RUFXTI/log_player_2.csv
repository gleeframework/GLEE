Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference from last round and go with 45/55 in your favor. It's still a fair deal considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
