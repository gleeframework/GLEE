"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split in my favor. This is because I know that Bob's money will depreciate at a slower rate than mine, so he will be less incentivized to reject this offer and risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more, the inflation will be significantly more detrimental to me than Bob. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money."
