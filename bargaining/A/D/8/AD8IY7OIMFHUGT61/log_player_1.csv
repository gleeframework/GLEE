"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to try to get a better deal. I'm still aiming for a decent amount, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Considering that my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm still not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed.

I'll think carefully about this one...

After considering the offer, I've decided to reject it again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm trying to be more reasonable and offer a 50/50 split. This way, we can both get a decent amount, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
