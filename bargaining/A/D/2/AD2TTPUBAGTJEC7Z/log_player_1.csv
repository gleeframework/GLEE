"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a significant one, to test his willingness to accept a decent offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my share, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is now more favorable to him, I'll think carefully before accepting.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation is now affecting my share even more, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it before the next round of inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! Bob's offer is still the same as the previous round, but considering the inflation, it's actually a better deal for me now. I'll accept this offer to avoid further erosion of my potential gain.
