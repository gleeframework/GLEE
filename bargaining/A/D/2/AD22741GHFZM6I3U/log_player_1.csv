Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. We both need to make sure we get a reasonable amount, especially with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
