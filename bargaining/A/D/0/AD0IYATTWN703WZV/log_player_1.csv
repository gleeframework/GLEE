"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a good chunk of the money in the first round. It's risky, but I figure Bob might be willing to take a smaller share to avoid risking the money getting devalued in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, the risk of inflation is real.  Getting a guaranteed $5000 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
