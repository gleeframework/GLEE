"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob, especially considering the inflation! Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this down the middle and end this game. We've both taken some hits from inflation, but this is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, considering the inflation and Alice's stubbornness, this is the best outcome for Bob.  It's much better than continuing to lose value with each round."
