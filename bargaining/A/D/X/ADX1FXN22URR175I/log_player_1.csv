"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me the lion's share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment... 

I'll decide to reject this offer as well. My goal is to maximize my gain, and I think I can do better than a 50-50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
