"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 99.9/0.1 split. I'm being generous to Bob, hoping he'll accept this fair offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a much better deal for me than what I offered in the first round. While I'd ideally get a larger share, it's better to accept this offer before the inflation eats away at more of my potential gains."
