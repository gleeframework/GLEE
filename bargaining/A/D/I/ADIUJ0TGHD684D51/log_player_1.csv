"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob's offer is for me to get $300,000 and him to get $700,000. This is a significant difference in the split, and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept.

However, Bob's message suggests that he thinks I'm being greedy, so maybe he's trying to make a more aggressive offer to get me to accept. I'm not sure if I should trust him on this.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and being willing to compromise to move the game forward."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth a lot less now!

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate too. The offer is for me to get $200,000 and Bob to get $800,000. It's a pretty lopsided split, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

Bob's message is trying to intimidate me, but I'm not sure if it's working. I'm still hesitant to accept, but I might have to consider it if I don't get a better offer soon.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.
