"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, a 60-40 ratio""}

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively fair split considering we're just starting out. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob is trying to take the larger share now, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially when I was the one who made the initial offer. I'll try to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering I made the initial offer""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, as the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, hoping he'll accept this compromise and we can wrap up the game."
