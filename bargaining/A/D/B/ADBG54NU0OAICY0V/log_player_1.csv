"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the inflation rates. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game early. If not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, given that the money will depreciate faster for you. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because it's heavily skewed in Bob's favor. Considering the inflation rates, I'd lose a significant amount of value if I accept this offer. I'd rather make a counteroffer in the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation rates and the fact that the money is worth less to both of us with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
