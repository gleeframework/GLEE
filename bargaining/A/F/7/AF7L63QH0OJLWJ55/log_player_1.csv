"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid going through too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not as eager to accept a 50/50 split as I was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to give up too much. Meet me in the middle, but not quite!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, considering the money is still worth less for me than it was in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's try to find a better middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less for me, I'm trying to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going too far into the rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer and divide the money with Bob."
