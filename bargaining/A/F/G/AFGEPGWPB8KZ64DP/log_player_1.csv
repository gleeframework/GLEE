"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the new values are:

* Alice gain: 50
* Bob gain: 45

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-45 split, as I'd rather get a slightly higher share. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the total value of the money is decreasing. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still the main winner""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining value, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to the edge, but I'll give you a slight nudge 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, the new values are:

* Alice gain: 43.85
* Bob gain: 56.15

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 45-55 split, as I'd rather get a slightly higher share. However, I'm also aware that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to wait too long to get my share.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
