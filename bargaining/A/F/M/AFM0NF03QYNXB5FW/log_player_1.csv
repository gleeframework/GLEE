"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 700k and you get 300k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 427,500.

I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 55/45 split. Can you consider a 60/40 or 65/35 split in my favor?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round, due to the cumulative 10% inflation (5% in the first round and another 5% in the second round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split. What do you think?""
}
```"
