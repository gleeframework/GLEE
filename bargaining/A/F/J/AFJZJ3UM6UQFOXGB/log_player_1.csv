I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good share of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my original offer, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent portion. With the inflation factor, I believe this is a fair compromise that might convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm still confident I can secure a better deal.  I'll reject again and try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, trying to find a balance between getting a good share and appealing to Bob's increasingly inflated needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, it's still significantly worse than my initial offer, and I believe I can do better.  I'll reject and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, offering Bob a slightly larger share.  With each round, the value of the money decreases for him, so I need to make this offer attractive to ensure a deal is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5904 
# Bob gain: 4096 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob's offers are getting less and less valuable to him due to inflation, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm accepting this offer, as there's a chance we might not reach a deal in the remaining rounds, and at least I'll walk away with something."
