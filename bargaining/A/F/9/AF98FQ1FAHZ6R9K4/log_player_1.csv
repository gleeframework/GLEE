"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I have the first offer. I'm hoping this is fair enough for Bob to accept, as it's still a significant amount for him, and I'm not taking too much advantage of the initial advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation considered. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm raising my offer to 75/25, which is still a better deal for me than Bob's previous offer. I think this is fair, considering the inflation that has occurred, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further devaluation of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is better for me than my previous offer and the risk of further devaluation of my potential gains. I'll accept his offer."
