"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to try to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round and I'm likely to get a worse deal. It's better to secure a 50/50 split than to risk getting less."
