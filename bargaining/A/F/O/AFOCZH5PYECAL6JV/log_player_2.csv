"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  I think this is a fair starting point that allows us both to benefit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less in each subsequent round, especially for Alice, I'll try to take advantage of that.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's not waste more rounds!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is impacting you less, but your previous offer was too low. This split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAnother offer from Alice! Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. The money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, so I'll try to use this to my advantage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next! I'm willing to take the risk and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With the increasing impact of inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Since the money is worth less and less for both of us, especially for Alice, I'll aim for a higher share.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll! I think this split is more realistic considering the decreasing value. Let's settle this before it's too late!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The value is plummeting with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, even with the inflation disparity. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split, finally! Considering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice, I think this is a reasonable offer. The money is worth 18.55% less for me and 59.04% less for Alice compared to the first round, so it's time to be realistic.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer and settle for the 50/50 split. It's better to get something than to risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
