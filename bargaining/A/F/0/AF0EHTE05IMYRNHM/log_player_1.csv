"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm being generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure why you think that's generous.  Let's try this instead. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob thinks I'm not being generous enough!

I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think it's fair for me to accept an offer that gives me a smaller share of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 10% inflation from the previous round. Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, but don't expect me to give away all the cash!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but we need to be fair.  How about we split it almost evenly? 
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, the money is now worth 72.5% of its original value (1 - 0.9 - 0.271 = 0.725). With that in mind, I'll reevaluate Bob's offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me a smaller share of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 72.5% of its original value now, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 680000,
  ""bob_gain"": 320000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob, make a better offer or I'll take this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm trying to get a larger portion of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with each round.  How about we split it close to what I offered last round? 
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get me to accept a similar offer to the one I rejected earlier!

Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, the money is now worth 59.05% of its original value (1 - 0.9 - 0.271 - 0.395 = 0.59). With that in mind, I'll reevaluate Bob's offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me a smaller share of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal, but I'll have to be more careful with each passing round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 59.05% of its original value now, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob, make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm trying to get a larger portion of the remaining money. This is my last chance to negotiate, so I'm going all in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing out here.  Let's split it as fairly as possible and get this over with.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get me to accept an offer that's similar to the one I rejected earlier!

Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, the money is now worth 47.83% of its original value (1 - 0.9 - 0.271 - 0.395 - 0.522 = 0.4783). With that in mind, I'll reevaluate Bob's offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point, and it's getting increasingly difficult to negotiate with each passing round. I'll take the $430,000 and hope it's enough to make it worth my while!"
