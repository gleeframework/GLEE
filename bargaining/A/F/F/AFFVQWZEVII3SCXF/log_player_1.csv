I propose a split of 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob. I'm aiming for a large share to start, but I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but also emphasizes my desire for a larger share."
