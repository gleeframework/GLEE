"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 7000 for me and 3000 for you. This seems fair given the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split. While I understand your concern about inflation, this seems like a more balanced starting point. Let's see where this takes us! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
