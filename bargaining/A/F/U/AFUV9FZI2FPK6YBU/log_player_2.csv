Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time.  We both lose more with each round, so a fair split makes the most sense. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
