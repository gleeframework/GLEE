"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 in this round is actually worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm giving up more than I did in the first round. However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to meet me in the middle, which implies that he thinks the initial offer was too high.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,400 in this round is actually worth $5,120 (80% of $6,400).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60% share for myself, which is a slight increase from the previous round. My message to Bob is to convey that I'm willing to find a middle ground, but I still think this split is more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You moved closer, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 in this round is actually worth $3,024 (52.8% of $6,000, not 48.8% less, I assume that was a typo).

I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer: $5,500 is worth $2,820 (51.2% of $5,500, not the same as the first round).

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.
