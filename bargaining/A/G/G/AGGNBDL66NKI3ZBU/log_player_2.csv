Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While inflation reduces the value of the money, the offer is still significantly better than the previous round where Bob got 4000. 
* **Potential for future rounds:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the next round.  It's possible she'll take an even larger share.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting this offer secures a decent amount, even with inflation factored in.  Rejecting it carries the risk of getting a worse offer or no offer at all."
