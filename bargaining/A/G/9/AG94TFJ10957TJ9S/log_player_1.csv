Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but given the potential for inflation, I think a more balanced approach is needed. I propose we split the money evenly.  This would give us both a solid foundation to handle any future devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500
