"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair split, Bob. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not sure why Alice thinks this is a fair split. Since we're playing a game, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split.  It's more even than your offer, and it gives us both a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, Bob.  Let's end this and split it closer to 50/50.  It's better for both of us than continuing to lose value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which is better than the initial offer.  It's also better to accept this deal now, since the money is losing value with each round."
