"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can end the game here. Since the money loses value over time, especially for me, I'm incentivized to try to reach a deal quickly. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. This offer won't last. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although I would gain $450,000, which is still a significant amount, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Considering the inflation rates, I'm losing more value with each passing round than Bob is, but I'm willing to take that risk to try and get a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and end this!""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase Bob's share slightly while still trying to maximize my own gain. Considering the effects of inflation, my share is now worth 20% less than the original amount, and Bob's share is worth 5% less. I've included a message suggesting that we meet in the middle and end the negotiations, hoping that Bob will see the value in compromising and accept this offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
