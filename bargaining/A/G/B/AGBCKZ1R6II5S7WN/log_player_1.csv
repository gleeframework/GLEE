"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. It still gives you a good share, but acknowledges my desire for a more even distribution. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
