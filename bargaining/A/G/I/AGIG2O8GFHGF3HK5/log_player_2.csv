It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal, even if just a little bit. Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is offering slightly more, but it's still not worth the risk of losing more money due to inflation. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""We're both taking a risk here.  I'm willing to offer you a little less, but I think this split is fair given the potential for inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm going back to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money,  50/50 is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  It's risky to keep going, and I don't want to end up with nothing."
