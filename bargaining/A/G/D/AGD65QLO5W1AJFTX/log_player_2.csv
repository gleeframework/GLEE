"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I think this is a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a different split in the next round. This one doesn't seem fair to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  I'll take a small hit to get this done.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this one.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer. The decreasing value of the money due to inflation makes me think that further negotiations might not be worth the loss in value. This seems like a reasonable compromise."
