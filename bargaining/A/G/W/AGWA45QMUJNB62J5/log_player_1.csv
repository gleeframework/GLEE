Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve a bit more. Inflation is biting! 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still not in my best interest. While he's feeling the pressure of inflation, I know I can get a better deal if I hold out for one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. The inflation is only going to hurt you more.  Take this offer while you still can!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've decided to compromise slightly. Bob is likely feeling very pressured by the inflation, and this offer is still heavily in my favor. It's a final attempt to secure a win before Bob potentially starts making irrational decisions out of desperation."
