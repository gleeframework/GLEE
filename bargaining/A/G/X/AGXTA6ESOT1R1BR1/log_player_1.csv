"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's agree and be done with it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of 800,000, which is 640,000, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of 200,000, which is 190,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, and I'm willing to accept it. I'll get 500,000, and Bob will get 500,000.
