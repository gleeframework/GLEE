Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script, I'll take 60% and you get 40%. It's a fair deal in my opinion.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again. The offer is a bit less generous this time. 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is less than what I initially wanted, it's still a decent amount of money, and it's better to accept now than risk losing even more to inflation."
