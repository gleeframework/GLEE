"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's start with a 60/40 split, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."
