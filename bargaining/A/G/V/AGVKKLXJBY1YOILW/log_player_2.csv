"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation you face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer seems reasonable, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round due to the higher inflation affecting Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm hoping for a slightly more equitable split. Considering our respective inflation rates, this proposal seems fairer to both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair deal.  Considering the rapid devaluation of your potential gains, I suggest we settle this now.  This offer ensures you'll walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a substantial amount despite the devaluation."
