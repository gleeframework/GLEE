Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $40 and took $60 for myself, hoping he'll see it as a reasonable and fair split. Let's wait for his response!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this 60/40, I think that's a fairer distribution. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, considering the inflation, I would be getting less value than I offered Bob in the previous round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer is closer to what I was hoping for, considering the inflation, I would still be getting less value than I think is fair. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's just split it evenly and be done with it""}\n\nI've decided to offer an even split, 50/50, in the hopes that Bob will see this as a fair and reasonable offer and accept it, ending the negotiations. The inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of the money I receive, so I want to wrap this up quickly."
