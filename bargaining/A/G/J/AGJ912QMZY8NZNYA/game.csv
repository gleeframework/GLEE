400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money -  it's a deal that benefits us both.",Bob,2,

800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, I understand you're aiming for more, but let's be practical.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but 80/20 is my final offer.  If you reject, we'll be back at square one in the next round with even less money to share.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I've factored in the inflation and a fair deal, and 50/50 is the only logical choice.  Take it or leave it - any more delays hurt us both.",Bob,4,
