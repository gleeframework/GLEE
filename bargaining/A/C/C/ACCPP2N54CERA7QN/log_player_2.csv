Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 580000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate. While the deal is slightly better than her previous offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to risk it going down to the wire."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a compromise that considers the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  This offer is still slightly in Alice's favor, acknowledging the difference in inflation rates, but it's much closer to an even split. By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept before both our positions erode further. If she rejects this, I'll be forced to get increasingly aggressive to salvage anything worthwhile from the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns. This offer is fair considering the rapid devaluation. Let's end this now before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but with time running out and my share rapidly losing value, I need to be pragmatic.  

* **Time pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and my position only weakens with each passing round.
* **Declining returns:** Even if I could get Alice to agree to a 50/50 split in the final round, the actual value I receive would be significantly diminished.
* **Alice's strategy:** Alice seems intent on holding firm to a roughly 45/55 split. It's frustrating, but continuing to reject her offers might result in even worse outcomes in later rounds.

Taking $450,000 now, though not ideal, is better than risking getting a smaller share of an ever-shrinking pie or, worse yet, walking away with nothing."
