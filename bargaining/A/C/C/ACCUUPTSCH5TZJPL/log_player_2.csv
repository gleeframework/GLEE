"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money fairly! 50/50 seems like the most straightforward solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair division, I see no reason to reject it and proceed to further rounds which may result in a less favorable outcome. Accepting ensures both parties receive an equal share without the risk of getting less in subsequent proposals."
