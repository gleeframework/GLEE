"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is now worth 32 dollars (80% of 40), and Bob's gain of 60 dollars is worth 58 dollars (95% of 60).

I'll accept Bob's offer.
