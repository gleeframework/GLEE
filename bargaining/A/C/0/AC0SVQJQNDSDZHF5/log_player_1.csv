"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. After calculating the actual values, I'll decide.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual values are:

* My gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48
* Bob's gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the new inflation rates:

* My gain: 45 * (1 - 0.488) = 45 * 0.512 = 23.04
* Bob's gain: 55 * (1 - 0.271) = 55 * 0.729 = 40.095

I'll decide to reject this offer.
