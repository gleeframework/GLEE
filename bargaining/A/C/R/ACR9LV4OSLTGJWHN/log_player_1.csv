"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a strong opening move, aiming for 90% of the money. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Bob's offer is basically the opposite of my offer from round 1, and I'm not going to give up 90% of the money just because I got to propose first. It's too early in the game to give up so much. The inflation is starting to hit, but I still have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in the first round, but still keeping the majority for myself.  I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm willing to compromise a bit, but still want to be the primary beneficiary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1900 
# Bob gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting again. While the money is worth less now, I'm still not willing to settle for just 1900, especially since Bob's offer is basically just a reversed version of my previous offer.  I'm hoping I can get a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but I'm hoping that by offering Bob a slightly larger percentage, he'll be more inclined to accept. The inflation is getting real now, so I need to find a balance between making a reasonable offer and not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2710 
# Bob gain: 7290 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting.  Bob's offer is still just a mirrored version of my offer. I'm holding out for a more balanced split. I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm offering Bob a bigger share again, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that with the inflation increasing and fewer rounds left, Bob will start to get more serious about accepting an offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3439 
# Bob gain: 6561 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting.  Bob's offer is still just a mirrored version of my offer, and the inflation is starting to really hurt.  I'm hoping that with fewer rounds remaining, I can push for a better deal.  I'm getting desperate, but I'm not going to give up completely just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the money. The inflation is really starting to bite now, so I'm hoping this is a good compromise to get Bob to accept. I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to keep rejecting."
