"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60% last time, now it's my turn to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me! 

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. But considering the drastic difference in our proposed gains, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth even less now! Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will reflect that.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 42-58""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not giving up too much yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! The money is worth significantly less, and I need to be careful.

However, Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards him. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Considering the drastic difference in our proposed gains, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 280000,
  ""bob_gain"": 720000,

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I still want a better deal than 28% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! It's getting harder to make decisions with the decreasing value.

However, Bob's offer is still not very appealing to me. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 30% gain when the money is worth so much less.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
