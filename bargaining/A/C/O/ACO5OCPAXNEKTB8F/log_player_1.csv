"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, which is 70 dollars, and Bob gets 30% of the original 100$, which is 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try 60-40 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'd rather accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
