"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
