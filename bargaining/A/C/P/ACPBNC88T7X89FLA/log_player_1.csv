"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. I'm starting with an aggressive offer, knowing that the inflation will work in my favor if the game continues. Let's see if Bob is willing to play along!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and it's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
