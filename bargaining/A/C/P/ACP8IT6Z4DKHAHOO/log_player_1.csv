"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so I can get my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'm not sure if this is a good deal.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, as the value of the money will continue to decrease. I'll take the offer.
