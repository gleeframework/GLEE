"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise early on, or if he's going to be more aggressive. Since the money loses value each round, I want to secure a significant portion as soon as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly better than my initial offer, but the inflation effect is substantial. I'm not yet convinced that he's willing to compromise fairly, and I'm still hoping to get a larger share.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a majority share. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also keeping in mind the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to hurt significantly. Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer in terms of real value, but the risk of getting nothing is becoming increasingly real. I'm going to accept this offer, as it's better than risking everything in the later rounds."
