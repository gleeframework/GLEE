4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a better deal. How about 60/40 in my favor? It's fair considering the next round will be worth less for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 60/40 in your favor is too much. Let's meet in the middle with a 54/46 split.  We both get a fair share, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.",Alice,3,
