Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 60/40 in your favor is too much. Let's meet in the middle with a 54/46 split.  We both get a fair share, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.

# Alice gain: 5400
