"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and Bob's offer is $500,000 for me, I need to calculate the equivalent value in Round 1 terms. 

$500,000 in Round 2 is equivalent to $500,000 / 0.8 = $625,000 in Round 1 terms.

Since Bob's offer is now equivalent to $625,000 for me, and I was initially offering $900,000, this offer is better for me.

I accept the offer.
