"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair balance considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While the 70/30 split may seem fair now, the decreasing value of money for me is a huge factor. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
