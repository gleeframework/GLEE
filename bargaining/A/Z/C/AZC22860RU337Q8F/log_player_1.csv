I propose to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  It's a generous first offer.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm willing to lower my share a bit, but I still need a significant portion to make this worthwhile.  Let's aim for a deal this round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is still a bad deal for me. While the inflation has hit me harder, I'm still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm dropping my share again, but I'm still prioritizing getting a large portion of the money.  Inflation is hitting hard, so we need to come to an agreement soon!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than previous rounds, it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation. I'm going to try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Inflation is getting serious now, so I need to lower my share to keep the offer reasonable. I'm hoping this is enough for Bob to accept and avoid further losses due to inflation."
