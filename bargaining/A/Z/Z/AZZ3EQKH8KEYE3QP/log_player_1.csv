"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose a nearly even split, with me receiving 999,999 dollars and Bob receiving 1 dollar. This ensures the majority of the money goes to me while still giving Bob a small token.  It's a fair starting point and leaves room for negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
