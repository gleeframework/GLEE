Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While the money is worth less for Bob, it's important to remember that Alice is also experiencing inflation (though at a lower rate). 
* **Potential Loss:**  If Bob rejects this offer, he risks getting a worse deal in the next round. There's no guarantee Alice will offer him more, and he might lose even more due to inflation. 
* **Better than Round 1:** The offer is significantly better than what Alice offered in the first round, even with the inflation factor.

**Overall:** It's strategically sound to accept the offer, as the potential gains from rejecting it are outweighed by the risk of losing more money."
