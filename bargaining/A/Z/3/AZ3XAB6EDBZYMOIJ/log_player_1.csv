"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with this offer. Let's split it 60/40, and I'll let you go first next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is tempting because it lets me propose in Round 3. However, accepting a 40/60 split when I could have potentially secured 60/40 is a significant loss.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
