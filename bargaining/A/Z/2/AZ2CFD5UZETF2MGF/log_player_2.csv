"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split: 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While getting something is better than nothing, the potential losses from inflation are less impactful to me than to her. I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""That's a bold start, Alice! How about this: I take 65%, you take 35%.  Consider the impact of inflation on your share if we wait any longer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Alice's initial offer was heavily imbalanced.  This proposal immediately shifts the power dynamic and sets a new reference point for negotiation. 
* **Inflation Pressure:** Emphasizing the impact of inflation on *Alice's* share is key. She loses value faster as time goes on.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While this offer is still advantageous to me, it leaves space for Alice to counter-propose and potentially reach a mutually agreeable split in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'll take 70%, you take 30%. This is a much better deal for both of us than waiting for more inflation to erode our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is moving towards a more even split, but her offer is still not favorable enough.  The rate of inflation is decreasing, and my losses are less than hers. I'm willing to bet she'll concede more in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice! Let's be reasonable. I'll take 55% and you get 45%. This is a fair deal considering the declining value of the money.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Closer to Middle Ground:** While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I'm moving my offer closer to a 50/50 split to incentivize Alice to accept soon.
* **Highlighting Declining Value:**  I'm subtly reminding her that each round makes the overall pot less attractive, even if her share grows in percentage terms.
* **Time Pressure:** By round 4, the urgency is increasing. My message aims to instill a sense that waiting is riskier than accepting a reasonable offer now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  If we don't agree now, we'll both lose a lot more due to inflation. Let's be smart and cut our losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're now past the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing significantly.
* **Alice's Tone:**  Her ""final offer"" statement suggests she's unlikely to move much further.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While I'd prefer a larger share, 40% of something is significantly better than risking 0% if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  

While this isn't the ideal outcome, accepting now secures a reasonable sum and avoids the potential disaster of walking away empty-handed."
