"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with, and I'm giving Bob a chance to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the money is losing value faster for you. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value faster for me, I need to be more cautious. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
