Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's previous offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a better deal. Given the risk of inflation, I'll propose a slightly biased offer.

Round 3

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my gain, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Alice's offer is biased towards her, I'll aim for a more even split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the further reduction in the value of my gain due to inflation, I'll propose an even more biased offer to try to get a better deal.
