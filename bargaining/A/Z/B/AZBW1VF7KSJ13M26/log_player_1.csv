"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split, giving you $6,000 and Bob $4,000.  It's a fair starting point, and since the money depreciates more quickly for Bob, this deal should be attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is the best course of action in this round.  The money is depreciating quickly, and the risk of getting nothing is too high if I reject this offer."
