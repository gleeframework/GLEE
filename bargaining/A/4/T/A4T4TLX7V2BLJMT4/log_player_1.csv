"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a bad deal. I'm not happy with the drastic change in the split, and I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject and see what Bob offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to stick to my initial strategy of offering a generous split, but I'll reduce my share slightly to acknowledge Bob's rejection.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is starting to impact the potential gains, I'm still not satisfied with this offer.  The split is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to keep offering a split that's closer to my initial proposal, hoping to find a compromise with Bob before the inflation makes things worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too lopsided in Bob's favor, and the inflation is making my potential gains much smaller. I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a more balanced split and see if Bob will compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose an even split this time. While the inflation is hurting, I think it's time to offer a compromise and see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is seriously impacting my potential gains,  I think it's time to accept this offer.  Bob's offer is slightly better than my last proposal, and with each round, the situation is getting worse. It's a better outcome than getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
