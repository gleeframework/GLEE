Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, my share is still worth more than yours. I'll take a bit more, but you should hurry before it's worth even less to you. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

``` 
The money is depreciating quickly for me. Although it's not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount.  It's better than waiting for another round and risking an even worse deal."
