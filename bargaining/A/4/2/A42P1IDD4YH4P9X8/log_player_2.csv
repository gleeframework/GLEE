"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob.  60/40 seems reasonable, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 60/40 split is fair in the first round, it's worth considering that the money will become worth less for Alice in the next round. It's beneficial to push for a better deal since you have the advantage in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, Alice, but I think we can both come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After all, with each passing round, the money will be worth less for both of us. Let's be strategic.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your strategic thinking, but that offer was too low.  Let's be reasonable.  55/45 acknowledges the time pressure without being unfair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still proposing a split that's not in my favor, and the inflation makes it less advantageous for her to keep negotiating. I'll try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7500,
""alice_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is my final compromise. Consider the fact that every round that passes, the money becomes worth less for both of us.  Let's agree on this and move on.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. Let's stop wasting time with unfair offers. A 50/50 split is the most logical and fair solution. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is now fair and logical considering the inflation.  While I still prefer a 70/30 split, the risk of losing everything outweighs the potential gains of continuing. A 50/50 split is the best option in this situation."
