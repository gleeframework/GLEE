"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one making the offer. This is a good starting point for negotiation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your starting point seems a little off, Alice. How about we reverse those numbers?  We can still negotiate from there. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
