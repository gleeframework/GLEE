"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. But I don't want to be too greedy, or Bob might reject again.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
