"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for you in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. The 10% inflation rate for me is relatively low, so I'm willing to take the risk. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take $58, you take $42. With inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take $55 and you get $45.  This is my final offer before the money shrinks even more! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept Alice's offer this time. Considering the inflation, Alice's gain is actually worth 36% less than the original amount, which means she's getting less value than it seems. Meanwhile, my gain of $45 is only worth 19% less, so I think this is a relatively fair deal, and I don't want to risk further inflation."
