"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself.  I want to see if he'll accept a quick deal, or if he'll try to push for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of the previous round.  I'm not going to accept this without even seeing what happens next round.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm not going to give in this early."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $8,000 for myself, giving Bob $2,000. This is still a pretty good deal for him, and I'm hoping that the threat of inflation will motivate him to accept it.  I'm starting to feel the pinch of the 10% loss with each round, so I want to get this settled sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal, but I'm not giving in yet. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm hoping I can get a slightly better offer in the next round. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm still confident that I can get a decent outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, to $7,000 for myself.  I'm hoping that the combination of inflation and Bob's previous rejection of my offer will encourage him to accept. It's getting risky, but I need to find a balance between a decent payout and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm losing a significant amount of money with each passing round, but I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a big gamble. Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm going to offer a decent chunk to Bob, hoping he sees this as a good compromise. I'm hoping the fear of further inflation will make him more agreeable to my offer.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm determined to get something for myself."
