I'm Bob, and I want to get the most money possible!  While 1000 dollars is better than nothing, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a big win!  If Alice rejects this, the money starts losing value and she'll be under pressure to accept a lower amount in the next round."

# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still going to reject.  While it's tempting to take $2000, I'm hoping I can get Alice to accept a closer split.  Let's see what she offers next round."
