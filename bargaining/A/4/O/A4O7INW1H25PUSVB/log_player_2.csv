"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%. We can negotiate further if you think it's too unbalanced. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 55/45, I'll take the larger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids any more rounds of negotiation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further rounds, which is a good thing considering the inflation."
