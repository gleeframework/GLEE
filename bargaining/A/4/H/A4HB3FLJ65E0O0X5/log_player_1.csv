"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 90:10 in my favor, as I will be the one taking the inflation hit. This way, you still receive something and we avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
