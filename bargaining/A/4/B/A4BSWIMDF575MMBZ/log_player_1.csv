"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! I'll give you a small amount to get us started. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to get a little more this time, but it's still my money!  Accept, or risk getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the offer from Bob is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 900
Bob gain: 9,000

I'll reject this offer. The amount I would get is too low, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the difference and call it a day!""
}
```"
