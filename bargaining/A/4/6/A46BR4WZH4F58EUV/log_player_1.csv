I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, aiming to secure a large portion of the money.  I figure this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is proposing a 90/10 split in his favor, and while I'm aware of the inflation, I'm not going to accept such an unfair offer. I'm not going to be the one to lose out on 8000 in a single round! It's my turn to propose again, and I'll adjust my offer accordingly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share by 1000, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and accept.  We both need to be flexible here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a very lopsided deal, and the inflation is really starting to bite.  I can't afford to accept anything less than a 50/50 split at this point. It's my turn to propose again, and I'll need to make a significant shift in my strategy to counter the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation has made it clear that we both need to be more realistic. I'm willing to give up more of my initial desired share to secure a deal, but I can't accept anything less than equal at this point. It's time for a fair compromise."
