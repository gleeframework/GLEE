Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split. This is a more equitable distribution for both of us, and it allows us to avoid the risk of losing value in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
