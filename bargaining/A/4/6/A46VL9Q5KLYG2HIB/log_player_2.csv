Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this 95/5. I'm willing to concede a little, but I still need the majority share.  This ensures we both get a decent amount, and avoids further inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000
