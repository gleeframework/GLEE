"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since you're losing value each round 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I need to get a decent share considering the inflation. This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my position is weakening, accepting such a low offer would set a terrible precedent for future rounds. I need to show some firmness, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to switch tactics. Bob is clearly playing a very aggressive strategy, banking on my fear of inflation to wear me down.  By offering a 50/50 split, I'm calling his bluff. It's a fair offer that he'd be foolish to refuse, especially given that the longer this drags on, the less valuable the whole deal becomes. This move puts the pressure back on him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value fast, I'm not. I think I can get an even better deal now 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough call, but I have to be realistic. Bob is being incredibly stubborn, and the inflation is starting to seriously hurt. While 40 is a significantly smaller share than I wanted, it's better than getting nothing if this goes all 12 rounds. Bob has shown no willingness to compromise, so I need to cut my losses and take what I can get before the value depreciates even further."
