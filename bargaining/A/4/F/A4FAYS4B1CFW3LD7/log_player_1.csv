Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split it 60/40, giving me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
