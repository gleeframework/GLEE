"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would have preferred my 60/40 split, accepting a 50/50 split now makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Alice is feeling the impact of inflation more than I am.  It's in my best interest to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Unknown Future:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in future rounds. She might even propose something worse! 
* **Fair Deal:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed $500,000 now than risk getting a worse deal later."
