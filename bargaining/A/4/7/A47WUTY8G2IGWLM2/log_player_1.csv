Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split instead.  Think it over carefully, as the value decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
