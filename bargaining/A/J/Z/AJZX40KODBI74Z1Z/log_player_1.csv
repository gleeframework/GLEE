"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less from round 1 and another 10% from round 2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still keeping a slight edge in case Bob accepts this offer!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm getting a bit impatient 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers. Considering the inflation, his offer is actually quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share!""

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more and more aggressive with his offers. Considering the inflation, his offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

However, I'm also getting a bit concerned that if I reject this offer, the next round might be even more unfavorable for me. I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the options, I'll accept the offer.
