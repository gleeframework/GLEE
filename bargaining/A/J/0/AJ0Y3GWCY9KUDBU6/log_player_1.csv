"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

This offer is a relatively equal split, with me taking 60% and Bob taking 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get a decent amount of money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with a fair split, but I think I can do better than 40% 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a larger share of the money. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, Bob's gain of 7000 is actually equivalent to 6650 in the first round, which is a significant amount.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, but I'm willing to give you 20%. Take it or leave it!""
