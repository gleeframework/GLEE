"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. Splitting it evenly might be fair under normal circumstances, but the inflation factor changes the dynamics. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I'm at a disadvantage due to inflation, I want to try to get a slightly larger share to compensate. However, I also don't want to be too greedy, or Alice might reject my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to even.  
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nThe inflation is taking its toll, and the value of the money for me is decreasing. However, Alice's offer of 48 is still not as good as my previous counteroffer of 55. Given the decreasing value of money, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, but I'm willing to try.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I need to balance between getting a fair share and the risk of Alice rejecting my offer again. Given that Alice was willing to compromise in the previous round, I'll try to meet her halfway while still considering the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation impact on my end.""}"
