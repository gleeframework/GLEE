"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now considering a lower offer from Bob. I'm not sure if I want to give up 20% of the remaining value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob was already trying to take a larger share, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to see how he responds. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more last round, now it's my turn!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth 48.8% less than the original $100, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it and risk getting even less in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
