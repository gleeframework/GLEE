Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This split reflects the impact of inflation on your share in future rounds.  I'm open to a counter-offer, but this is a strong starting point. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
