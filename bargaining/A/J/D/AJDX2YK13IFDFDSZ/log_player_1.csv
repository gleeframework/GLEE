"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount he's offering.

```
# Actual Bob gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, but I'll make sure to keep in mind that the actual amount I'll receive is slightly more than what Bob is offering. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
