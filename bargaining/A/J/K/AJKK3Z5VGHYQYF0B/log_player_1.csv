Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less for me, so I'd rather get a larger share. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob in Round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for me now, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal. However, Bob's offer is actually a slight improvement from his previous one, so I'll accept it this time.
