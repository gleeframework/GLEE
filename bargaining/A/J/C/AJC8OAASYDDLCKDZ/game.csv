70.0,30.0,I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also considering the diminishing value of money due to inflation.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split, considering the value of money will continue to decrease with each passing round. This way, we can both get a decent share while still being fair.",Bob,2,
