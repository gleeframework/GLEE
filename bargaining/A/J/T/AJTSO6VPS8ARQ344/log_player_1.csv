Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor. Since I'm the one making the proposal, I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it, especially since inflation only affects me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more money, I'm accepting this offer because:

1. **Inflation:** Each round, the value of the money I get decreases, so it's better to take what I can now.
2. **Equal Split:**  Bob's offer is a fair split. While I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's no guarantee that the next round will be better."
