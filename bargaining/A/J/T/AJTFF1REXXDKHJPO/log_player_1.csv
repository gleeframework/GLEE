"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Considering the inflation, the actual amount I would gain in this round is 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 (since 10% less is 0.9 times the original amount).

In this round, I'm still gaining less than Bob, but I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

 Original amount: 460,000

I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the previous round, but still less than Bob. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept this offer.
