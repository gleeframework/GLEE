I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a significant imbalance in the first round.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
