"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and start the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not going to get any more generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $540,000.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
