Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split. This is a fair and equitable division, considering the inflation we need to factor in. Let's end this round and get our share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
