**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing. While a 56/44 split in her favor is slightly better than her first offer, it's still heavily skewed towards her. There's a good chance I can get a better deal if I hold out a little longer."
