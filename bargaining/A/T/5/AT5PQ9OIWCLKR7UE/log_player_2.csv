"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for me! While it seems like a small amount now, the inflation will quickly eat into my share in future rounds. I need to negotiate for a larger portion."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer gives me a chance to recover some value despite the inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This gives me a better share, and you still get a decent amount despite the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to make it seem like she's compromising, but this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. With each round, the value of my potential earnings plummets. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It gives us both a reasonable share considering the time pressure and the inflation working against me.  Let's close the deal and avoid walking away with nothing.""}
