Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on my side, I'm willing to take the risk. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's a tough decision, accepting is the most logical choice. Inflation has made the money worth significantly less for Alice, and accepting ensures she at least gets something. It's a gamble to reject and hope for a better deal in the next round, but the risk of getting nothing at all is too high."
