"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. 60-40, my way this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the script, but the numbers are the same as my original offer. I'm not impressed.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45""
}
```

I'm adjusting the numbers to reflect the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm offering Bob 450,000$."
