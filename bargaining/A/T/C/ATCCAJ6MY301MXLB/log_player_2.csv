"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob.  Let's get this started! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's a good idea to see if we can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly.  This way we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid losing too much to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think my last offer was fair, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it more evenly this time, with a slight advantage to me since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While it's not a perfect split, it's getting closer to what I'd like. And with the inflation, taking a slightly smaller share now is better than risking losing even more in future rounds."
