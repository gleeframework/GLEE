I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can avoid any potential for inflation to hurt us later.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, I believe I can do better.  The inflation rate is starting to hurt, but I still have time to negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share this time, but still a significant amount.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about getting a fair deal, but also that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse, but I'm still not willing to give in. Inflation is taking a bite out of my potential gains, but I'm hoping to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a compromise, trying to meet Bob halfway. This offer acknowledges the increasing inflation and allows us both to get a decent share, but it's also a clear signal that I'm not willing to accept much less than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hurting me significantly now, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer anything better in the next round. This offer, while not ideal, is a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome considering the circumstances. I accept."
