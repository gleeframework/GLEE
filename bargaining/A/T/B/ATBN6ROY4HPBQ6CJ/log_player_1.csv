I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a significant share of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I need to be realistic. Inflation is a significant factor, and the offer is still advantageous for me compared to the initial round.  Accepting allows me to secure some value rather than risk getting nothing in the end."
