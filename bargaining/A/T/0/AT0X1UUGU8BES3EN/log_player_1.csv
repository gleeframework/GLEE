"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. I'm leaving a message for Bob to consider my proposal and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider Bob's proposal.

I accept Bob's offer.
