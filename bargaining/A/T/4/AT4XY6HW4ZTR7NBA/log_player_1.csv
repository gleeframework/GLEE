# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since he thinks he deserves more, I'll try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to offer me only $30, I'll propose a slightly more generous offer to test his willingness to compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Will you meet me in the middle?""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
