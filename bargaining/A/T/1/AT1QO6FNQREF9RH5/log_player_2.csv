"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's ""fair"" in terms of the initial split, I know the money is going to be worth less to me with each passing round. I'll try to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation, but I'm still willing to work with you. This is a fair compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your need for a larger share due to inflation, but I believe this offer is a more balanced compromise. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, this offer is a good compromise. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk losing even more by rejecting this offer and going another round."
