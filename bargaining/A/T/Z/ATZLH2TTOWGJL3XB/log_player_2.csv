Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn again, a bit more for me

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable. This offer gives you a slight advantage, and time is running out with inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly using the inflation to her advantage, and her offers are getting progressively worse for me. While the offer isn't terrible in isolation, I need to show her I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer deal.  It's getting risky, but I have to try."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be sensible: a slight advantage for you, but we both walk away with something.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a calculated risk. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but she also risks getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be walked all over. A slight bump for her might be enough to seal the deal, especially now that we're past the halfway point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. Alice is clearly being ruthless, and this offer is starting to get painful. However, rejecting it means we're entering extremely dangerous territory. 

Let's analyze:

* **Time:** We have 5 rounds left.  If I reject this, there's a real chance we won't reach an agreement in time, and we'll BOTH lose everything.
* **Alice's Behavior:**  She's shown no sign of budging from her strategy. She might be bluffing, hoping I'll cave, or she might be willing to risk it all.
* **Future Offers:** Even if she does offer slightly more in the next rounds, the inflation will continue to eat away at my share.

Taking all this into account, and considering the very real possibility of ending up with nothing, I have to swallow my pride and accept this unfavorable offer.
