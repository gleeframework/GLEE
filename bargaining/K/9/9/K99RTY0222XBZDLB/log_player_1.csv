"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 4800. I'll accept Bob's offer.
