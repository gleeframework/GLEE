Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's aim for a split closer to 60/40. This way, we both get a decent share, and we avoid the risk of losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take it.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and we need to get something before we both lose everything."
