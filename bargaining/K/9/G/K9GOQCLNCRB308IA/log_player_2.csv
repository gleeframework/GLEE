"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 39 
# Alice gain: 61 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** While I lose 36% of my potential earnings, Alice loses only 9.75% of hers.
* **Relative Gains:** In round 1, I was offered $25.  In round 3, I'm being offered $39.  This is a significant increase for me, even considering inflation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round.  Alice might continue to make proposals that are favorable to her. 

It's a gamble, but accepting the offer seems like the best strategy in this situation."
