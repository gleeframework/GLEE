"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was generous, but I believe this split better reflects the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand the value of the money is changing. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'd like to see a fairer split for myself as well.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It reflects the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, the value of the money for Alice is decreasing rapidly. Accepting this offer ensures Alice receives something rather than risk getting nothing at all in subsequent rounds."
