"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm now looking at a gain of $40, which is worth 95% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with less than half of the original amount. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slight edge""

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm also not eager to keep negotiating. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob to come up with a better offer, but I'm starting to think I might be able to do better if I hold out a bit longer."

```
{

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to think that Bob might be getting a bit desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $30, even though it's a relatively small share of the original $100. At this point, I'd rather take what I can get than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
