I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob. This way, we can both get a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll offer Bob 400,000$ and keep 600,000$ for myself. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
