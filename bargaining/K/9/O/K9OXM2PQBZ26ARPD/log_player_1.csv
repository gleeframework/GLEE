"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. My message to Bob is ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is the best way to go! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns!

Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
* Bob gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good deal for me""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
