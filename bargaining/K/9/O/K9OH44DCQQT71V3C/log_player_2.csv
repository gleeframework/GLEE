Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out.  I need to incentivize her to accept a deal that benefits me more before inflation eats away at her potential gains (and thus her willingness to negotiate)."
