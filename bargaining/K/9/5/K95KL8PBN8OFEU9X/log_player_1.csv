I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I figure it's better to secure a good portion of the money early on, especially since the value of the money is decreasing faster for Bob.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not ideal to get only half of the money, the value is decreasing much faster for Bob.  If I reject this offer, there's a strong chance that he will offer me even less in the following rounds.  It's better to secure a reasonable amount now."
