"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining money in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can move on to the next round where I can negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We can then focus on how to best spend our share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to split it evenly, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if that's the best deal for me.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the inflation, I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take this offer and you'll get a decent chunk of the remaining money. If you reject, I'll make you regret it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a fair share, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! With my gain being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, I'm getting desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. On one hand, it's a decent share, and I'm getting older and wiser (in the game). On the other hand, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

After some thought, I'll accept this offer.
