"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being generous! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being stingy!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my $3000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $2400. Bob's $7000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $6650.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it. For now, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80% = 64%). I'll propose a slightly more generous offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'm still not budging! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to take advantage of my desperation!

Let's calculate the actual values of the offer, considering the inflation:

My $4500 is worth 36.4% of the original $10,000 (64% * 56.25% = 36.4%).
Bob's $5500 is worth 55.5% of the original $10,000 (85.74% * 64.5% = 55.5%).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm getting a bit worried that if I reject it, the value of the money will continue to decrease. I'll have to think carefully...

For now, I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
