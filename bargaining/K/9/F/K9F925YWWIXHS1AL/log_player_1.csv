Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is fair considering the inflation.  Let's make a deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
