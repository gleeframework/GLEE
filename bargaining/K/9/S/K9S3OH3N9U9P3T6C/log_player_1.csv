"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that we're starting with a clean slate. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'll give you a slight edge since you made the first offer 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject the offer for now and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best I can get. Let me try to negotiate further.""
