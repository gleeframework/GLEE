Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's end this game and both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
