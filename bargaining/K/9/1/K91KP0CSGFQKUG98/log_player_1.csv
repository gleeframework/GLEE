"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to start with a very uneven offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept it in the first round, as the inflation risk is minimal.  If he doesn't, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it would be nice to get more, this offer is still significantly better than waiting and risking a further reduction in my share due to inflation. I'll accept and move on."
