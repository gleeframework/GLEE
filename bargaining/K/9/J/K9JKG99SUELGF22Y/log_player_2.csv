# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than half the money, especially since the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair share, Alice. Let's split the money and move on!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time I offered, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this deal.  Alice is getting way more than half, and I'm still losing value with each round.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing value with each passing round. Let's split the money evenly and call it a day. It's the fairest and most logical solution.""
