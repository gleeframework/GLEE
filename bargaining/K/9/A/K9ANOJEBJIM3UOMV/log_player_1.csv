"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, given that I'm initiating the negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and given the inflation, I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Let's take the money!"
