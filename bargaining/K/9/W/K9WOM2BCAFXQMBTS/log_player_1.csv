Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."

# Alice gain: 4000

Do you accept this offer?","The offer is the same as the one I made in Round 1, but since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer, since it's not a good deal for me.
