"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to get a slightly larger share, considering the money is worth 10% less for me now."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You gave me a chance to think, now it's my turn to counteroffer. A slight adjustment to the split, but still a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better, considering the money is worth even less for me now. I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of my winnings."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,

}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not leaving too much on the table."
