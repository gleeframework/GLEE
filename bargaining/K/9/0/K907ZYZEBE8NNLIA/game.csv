4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation factor. Let's make this quick and end the game.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is impacting you, but your previous offer was too imbalanced. This is a 55/45 split, which is more reasonable considering there's still a risk for both of us if we don't reach an agreement.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split this evenly.  The inflation is making this game too risky, and I don't want to keep pushing for more.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this now.",Bob,4,
