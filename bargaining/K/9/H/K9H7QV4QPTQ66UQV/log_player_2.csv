Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is going down Bob, let's settle this. I'm taking a small loss from my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or the pot shrinks again.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  Agree to a reasonable deal or this will hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the rounds are getting very dangerous for Bob. He's losing value quickly. While not ideal, taking a slightly smaller share than his original rejecting offer makes more sense than risking another round of depreciation."
