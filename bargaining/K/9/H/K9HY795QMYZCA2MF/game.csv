5500.0,4500.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?",Bob,2,
,,"It seems like you're not taking the inflation into account, Bob. Let's try to find a more balanced deal.",Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing more to inflation with each round. 58/42 reflects that, don't you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"The inflation is hurting us both, Alice.  I'm willing to meet closer to the middle with a 52/48 split. Let's close this out.",Bob,4,
,,"While I appreciate the movement, Bob, the split still doesn't feel quite right considering how much faster the inflation is hitting me. We still have time to reach a fairer agreement.",Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"This is a compromise, Bob. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, and 56/44 feels like the most balanced we can get at this point.",Alice,5,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is eating away at the pot. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to settle this before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
,,"Alright, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I'll accept the 50/50 split. Let's just call it a draw and end this before the inflation eats everything up.",Alice,6,accept
