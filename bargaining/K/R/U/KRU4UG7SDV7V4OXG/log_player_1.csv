Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,

Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting more and more skewed towards him! With the money worth 22.62% less for me and 40.95% less for Bob, I'm not getting a very good deal. I think I should try to negotiate further.

However, considering the trend, I'm starting to think that Bob might be trying to squeeze me out. I'll reject this offer.

Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting even more skewed towards him! With the money worth 30.17% less for me and 52.17% less for Bob, I'm not getting a very good deal at all. I think I've reached the point where I should start thinking about accepting a deal, even if it's not ideal.
