"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, in real terms, I'm only getting $450,000 ($500,000 x 0.9), which is less than what I proposed in Round 1. I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I'm taking a firmer stance this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up!

Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll actually be getting around $441,000 ($400,000 x 0.9091, accounting for the 10% decrease in the first round and 17.1% decrease in the second round).

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
