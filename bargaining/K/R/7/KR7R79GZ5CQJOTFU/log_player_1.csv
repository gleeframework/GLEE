"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 95% for myself and giving Bob only 5%.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept quickly, before the inflation kicks in and my share shrinks too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though my share is worth less now because of inflation, 5 dollars is a ridiculously low amount for me to accept. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 85%, and give Bob 15%.  This is still a fairly large advantage for me, but I think it's a more reasonable offer that might incentivize him to accept, especially since the value of his share is likely shrinking significantly due to inflation."
