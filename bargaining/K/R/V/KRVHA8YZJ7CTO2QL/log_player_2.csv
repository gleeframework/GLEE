"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account in my proposal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is fair for both of us. What do you think, Alice?""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time, Bob. Inflation is affecting us both, so it seems like the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 19% less for me than in the first round, and 9.75% less for Alice, I need to consider whether this 50/50 split truly is fair given the impact of inflation on both of our gains.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to see if we can find a more favorable division considering the increasing effect of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation. Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice than in the first round, I'll adjust the split accordingly.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I believe a 58/42 split is more appropriate now. This way, we both still get a significant amount, but it reflects the differing impacts of inflation on our gains.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice!"
