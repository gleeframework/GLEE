# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth less than the $2,000 I would have gained in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money I'd gain in this round. Initially, $10,000 was worth $8,000 in round 1, but due to inflation, it's now worth 0.52 * $8,000 = $4,160. 

Considering the inflation, the $4,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth more than the $2,000 I would have gained in the first round. I'll accept this offer.
