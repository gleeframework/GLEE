Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and avoid losses from inflation. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split, considering I'm losing value faster. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Bob, my offer was already generous.  You lose value faster than I do, so each round makes a quick agreement more important. I'm willing to go up a bit to 65/35, but that's my final offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both lose value, but I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at 58/42. Last chance before it's not worth it for me. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer will erode the potential gains for both of us. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance I might get an even worse deal in the next round, especially given Bob's ""last chance"" warning.
* **Relative Loss:** While Bob's gain is proportionally larger, the absolute difference in our gains is becoming less significant with each round of inflation.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a much smaller share later.
