Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a generous offer for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair split given the inflation, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all in the end."
