"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. This way, I'll get $8,000, which is 80% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 6000 * 0.95 (95% of the original value) = 5700
Bob's gain: 4000 * 0.9 (90% of the original value) = 3600

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting desperate yet. What's your next move, Bob?""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit more aggressive, Alice. I think I can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 5500 * 0.8574 (95% * 0.95 * 0.9) = 4702.1
Bob's gain: 4500 * 0.7273 (90% * 0.9 * 0.8) = 3266.85

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up yet. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, trying to get closer to a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. Let's call it a day and split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 5000 * 0.7778 (95% * 0.95 * 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.95) = 3889
Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.5926 (90% * 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.9 * 0.95) = 2953

It looks like we're getting close to the end of the game, and this offer seems like a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.
