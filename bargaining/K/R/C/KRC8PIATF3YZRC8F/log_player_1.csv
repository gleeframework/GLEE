"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous share considering the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. In this case, Bob's offer is actually a good one, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can split the 100 dollars down the middle."
