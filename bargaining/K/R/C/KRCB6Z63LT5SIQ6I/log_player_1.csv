"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $40 is worth less than the $50 I proposed in the first round, but I still think this offer is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept it.
