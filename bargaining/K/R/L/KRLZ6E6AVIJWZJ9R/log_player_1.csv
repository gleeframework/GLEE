"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is more fair.  Let's move forward and see if we can find a solution we both like. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $450,000 x 0.95 = $427,500
Bob gain: $550,000 x 0.95 = $522,500

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2. It's a slightly more even split, and I'm willing to compromise to move forward.
