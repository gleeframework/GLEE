Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50

This is the best time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation and offering a 50/50 split. While it might seem like Bob is losing out on potential gains from earlier rounds, waiting longer risks Alice proposing even less favorable splits.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining and the value of the money decreasing rapidly, the potential for securing a better deal diminishes significantly. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer carries a significant risk. If Alice proposes a worse deal in later rounds, Bob is forced to accept a less favorable outcome or risk getting nothing at all. 

Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable share of the money, even with the impact of inflation."
