"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. I'm curious to see if Alice will be more generous in the next round, knowing about the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need more for myself to account for the potential inflation.  Let's work together and get this money split before it loses too much value!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a slight adjustment in our shares. This way, we can both benefit without waiting for the money to lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has recognized the inflation factor, and her offer is slightly better than my previous offer while still accounting for the diminishing value of money. Accepting is the best option to avoid further potential losses."
