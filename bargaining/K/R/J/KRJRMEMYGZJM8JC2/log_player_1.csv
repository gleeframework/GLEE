"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take a bigger share!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* My share: 400,000 * 0.8 (80% of original value) = 320,000
* Bob's share: 600,000 * 0.9 (90% of original value) = 540,000

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 80% of my original share, but I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not being generous anymore!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the majority this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

* My share: 300,000 * 0.516 (52% of original value) = 155,280
* Bob's share: 700,000 * 0.732 (73.2% of original value) = 511,640

I'm not happy about giving up such a large share, but I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.
