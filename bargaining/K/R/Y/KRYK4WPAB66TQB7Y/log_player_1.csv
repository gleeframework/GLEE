"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more given the potential for future negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 250,000 is now worth 200,000, which is a significant decrease.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I don't want to risk waiting and potentially getting even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer to get some money now, even if it's not ideal.
