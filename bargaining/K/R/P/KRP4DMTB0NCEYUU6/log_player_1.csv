"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000$ and let Bob have 100,000$.  This gives me the most money in the first round, but it's important to keep Bob satisfied enough to not completely shut down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still a significant decrease from my initial proposal. I'm hoping to get closer to a 50/50 split as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split. By offering Bob 400,000, I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate and that I value a long-term agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd consider fair, and the inflation is starting to take a toll. It's better to secure some money now than risk losing it all."
