"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice offered 50-50, I'll try to get more for myself. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the 45 I'd get in this round is equivalent to 36% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round. This is a better deal than the 60 I offered in round 2, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to do better. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
