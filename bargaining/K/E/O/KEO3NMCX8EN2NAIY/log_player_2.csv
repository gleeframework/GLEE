"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 100k, I'll take the rest.  We can always negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While starting with a seemingly fair negotiation is tempting, accepting this sets a bad precedent and gives Alice far more negotiating power. It's worth seeing what other offers arise as the rounds progress."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40.  I'm confident we can find a good middle ground here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is budging, but this offer is still not favorable in the long run. The inflation rate hurts Bob significantly with each passing round, so settling for 40% now will feel much worse in a few more rounds.  We need to push for a more substantial gain while there's still time."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""We need to find a solution that works for both of us, Alice.  Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time pressure and ensures we both benefit."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation. We can both walk away with a substantial sum. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough call, but the clock is ticking and inflation is eating into Bob's potential gains.  While not ideal, a 45/55 split is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to hold out for a better deal.  Accepting now secures Bob a reasonable amount, even with the inflation."
