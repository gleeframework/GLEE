Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  Since I don't know how inflation impacts him, I want to secure a deal quickly.  This offer leaves me with 90% of the money, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a higher share, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation factor. I'm not sure how long this game will last, so it's better to secure a decent share now."
