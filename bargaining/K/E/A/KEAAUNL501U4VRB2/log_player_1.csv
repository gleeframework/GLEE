"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more favorable split for me would be better in the long run, considering the inflation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than 55% of the total, especially considering the inflation. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's getting tough, but I'm willing to compromise. 50-50 seems fair, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
