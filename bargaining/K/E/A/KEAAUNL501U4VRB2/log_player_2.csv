"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair split in the current round, the inflation will affect me more than Alice, and I can potentially get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think a slightly more favorable split for me would be better in the long run, considering the inflation. Let's see if you agree."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's getting tough, but I'm willing to compromise. 50-50 seems fair, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I could potentially get more in future rounds, the inflation is starting to significantly impact my gains.  A 50-50 split is a fair compromise at this point."
