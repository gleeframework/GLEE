"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split. This ensures we both benefit significantly. Don't let greed lead to nothing for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
