Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair compromise, considering your 10% inflation rate per round. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
