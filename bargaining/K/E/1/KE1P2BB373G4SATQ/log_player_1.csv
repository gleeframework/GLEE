"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation, but I'll proceed with the assumption that it is.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 1000$ more than in the first round, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
