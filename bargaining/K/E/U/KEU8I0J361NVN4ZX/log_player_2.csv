"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal for myself. I'll need to see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, let's see if you'll take a slightly less even split.  We can always negotiate further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a bit more for myself to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer to get even more, this offer is a significant improvement from the first round. I don't want to risk further negotiation and losing out on the gains due to inflation."
