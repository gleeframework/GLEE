"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split. It's still a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to take into account the inflation and the 5% decrease in my potential gain. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll consider it a fair compromise."
