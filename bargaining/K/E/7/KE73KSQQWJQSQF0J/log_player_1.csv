"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you take 30.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to think carefully about the value of the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in this round, taking a smaller share while still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to be careful. Meeting in the middle at 50-50 seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50% share and call it a day. It's not the most exciting outcome, but it's better than walking away with nothing!"
