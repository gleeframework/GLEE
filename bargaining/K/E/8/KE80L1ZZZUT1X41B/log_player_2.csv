Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pressure me with threats of getting even less.  However, I'm still not convinced that I need to accept this offer.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

This is a tough choice, but I have to accept. With only one round left, the value of the money I gain is extremely low. I'm taking a huge loss, but it's better than getting nothing at all."
