"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 6500,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this is the best I can do. We need to reach an agreement before things get even worse. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting worse due to inflation, and it heavily favors him.  There's still time to negotiate a better deal, even if it means waiting until the later rounds when Bob's position weakens significantly."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's better than nothing.  Let's reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough spot, but Bob's offer is getting drastically worse for him due to inflation.  While $2,000 isn't ideal, holding out for one or two more rounds could force Bob to offer a much larger share to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the circumstances.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky. While Bob's offers are getting worse for him, there's a chance he'll gamble on you accepting a low offer in the final rounds. This offer is a compromise, slightly lowering my previous ask to entice Bob while still securing a larger share.  The ""final offer"" message adds pressure for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair share, but time is running out.  This is my best offer, and it's still more than you'll get if we don't reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is brutal, but Bob is clearly banking on my fear of getting nothing. However, $9,000 for him at this rate of inflation is worth significantly less than it was initially. I'm betting he'll crack under the pressure in the next round or two. It's a gamble, but potentially a very lucrative one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer now, or you'll be getting even less. Don't be foolish.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm returning to my initial offer. It's a strong stance that emphasizes Bob's rapidly dwindling position. He's likely panicking now, and this firm offer might be enough to make him realize he's run out of time to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're down to the wire. This is my final offer. It's a lot for me, considering the inflation. If you don't accept, we both get nothing. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is agonizing, but Bob is clearly desperate.  He's offering a pittance while trying to frame it as a big concession. There are only two rounds left. He *has* to know his position is almost untenable. I'm betting he'll offer almost anything in the next round to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 9000,
""bob_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""Last chance, Bob.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's now or never. Bob is likely reeling from the inflation, and this offer, while extreme, reflects the reality of the situation. He gets a small something, which is far better than the nothing he's facing. This is a power play, but with one round left, it's the most strategically sound option."
