Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60/40. We both get a good amount, and we avoid losing value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try and get a better deal.  I think we can do better than a 60/40 split, especially since inflation is a factor."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Since the money is losing value, let's meet in the middle and split it 57/43. We should both be happy with this deal.

# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I think we can both do better than a 57/43 split.  I'll try to make a better offer next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly better deal than before. 55/45 is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's end this before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal. While inflation is a concern, I think we can still reach a more favorable split. I'll see if I can sway Alice in the next round."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing a lot of value due to inflation. I'll give you a slightly better deal than before. 53/47 is a fair split considering the circumstances. We need to end this soon. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. While I understand the urgency of inflation, I'm not convinced that 53/47 is the best we can do. I'll try to make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value of our potential gains is quickly shrinking. I'm offering a 75/25 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances.  We should finalize this now to avoid further losses.""

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time and value. I'll make one more compromise. 52/48 is as good as it gets. If we don't agree now, we'll both end up with almost nothing. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice. We've both lost a significant amount due to inflation, and continuing to reject offers risks losing even more.  This is a reasonable split given the circumstances."
