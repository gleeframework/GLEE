I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it's a fair amount of money for me, and still leaves Bob with something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 75/25 split is still a decent gain for me, especially with the inflation.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk losing everything."
