"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000.  This is a pretty standard starting point - I get the majority, but give Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is more fair than my first offer, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference from my last offer and Bob's. This should be a good deal for both of us, as we're both likely to get a higher amount than what we'd get in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not ideal, and I think I can do better. We're getting close to the middle, but with the inflation factor, I need a higher share to make it worthwhile. I'm going to try to negotiate a deal that's more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to go for a slightly lower amount than my previous offer, but still a good deal for me. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a step towards a more balanced agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, but I still think I can secure a better deal. Bob's offer is getting closer to 70/30, but I'm hoping to get a split closer to 60/40.  I'm not willing to accept a deal where I get less than 40%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. We're both losing money with each round due to inflation, and I think this is the fairest way to divide the remaining money."
