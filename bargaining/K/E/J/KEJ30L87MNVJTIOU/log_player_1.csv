I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Since the money is worth less to Bob in each round, I'm starting with a higher share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is worse for me than my offer in the first round. I'll reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm reducing my share slightly to 5500, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  With each round, the money is worth less for both of us, so I'm aiming for a compromise to avoid further losses."
