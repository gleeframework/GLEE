"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to find a mutually beneficial split.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better split, considering the increasing impact of inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Alice's money is worth 19% less now, I'll try to find a balance that considers this factor.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  We need to reach an agreement before the inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, especially on Alice's end, and the fact that this is Alice's final offer, I believe accepting this proposal is the most reasonable decision to ensure we both receive a substantial amount before the value decreases further."
