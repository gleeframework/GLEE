Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer in my favor. It's a high risk, high reward strategy. If Bob rejects, it will cost him more in the next round due to inflation. But, if he accepts, I get a big chunk of the money. Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1000, it's far too low.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a much better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. Since Bob rejected my last offer, and with inflation hitting him harder, I think this is a fair compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my share to ensure we reach an agreement."
