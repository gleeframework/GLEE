"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to divide the money and we can both be happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, I'll have to calculate the total amount of money available after two rounds of inflation.

Initially, we had $1,000,000. After the first round, Bob's gain would have been $100,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 95% of that, which is $95,000. 

So, the total amount of money left is $1,000,000 - $95,000 = $905,000.

Now, Bob is proposing to split this amount evenly between us. That means I would get $452,500 and Bob would get $452,500.

I'll accept this offer.
