I'm going to try and get the most money for myself, but I'll start with a seemingly fair offer, knowing that the money will be worth less in the future.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money I receive is worth less due to inflation, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get in the next round.  I'm taking it!"
