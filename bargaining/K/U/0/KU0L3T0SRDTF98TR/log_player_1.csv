"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can start low 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $20, which is worth less than my initial proposal of $50. On the other hand, Bob will get $80, which is a significant portion of the total amount.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself.""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, you can try to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new values, I'm getting a much smaller share, and Bob is getting a significant majority of the pie. I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll try to negotiate.

Since I'm getting only $10, which is a tiny fraction of the original amount, I'll try to push for a bit more. I'll:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75, ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share, but I still want to get something substantial out of this deal.""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, giving Bob a larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you'll get a small share 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new values, I'm getting an extremely small share, and Bob is getting the majority of the pie. I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it.

Since I'm getting only $5, which is an incredibly small fraction of the original amount, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. On one hand, I might as well take what I can get, but on the other hand, I might be leaving too much on the table.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 15, ""bob_gain"": 85, ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share, but I still want to get something out of this deal.""}

I'm trying to be more realistic about the situation, given the inflation and the previous rejections. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm still holding out for a decent amount for myself."
