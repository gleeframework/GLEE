Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split relatively fairly, Bob. A 50/50 split seems fair, but I'm offering you a little less because I'm losing money to inflation with each round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share. But remember, the value decreases for me each round. This offer is a compromise, a bit closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
