Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases substantially. We are already at Round 5 of 12, and waiting longer significantly diminishes returns. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer we wait, the less attractive even a 50/50 split becomes. Accepting 44% now is better than potentially getting a slightly better deal later when the overall value is much lower.
* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a significantly better deal in the later rounds, especially with the time pressure.

It's a tough decision, but in a game of diminishing returns, sometimes accepting a decent offer is the best strategy."
