"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal that's hard to refuse. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 40 / 0.9 = 44.44
* Bob gain: 60 / 0.9 = 66.67

I'll reject this offer. It's not a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2. So, the effective value of the money is now 90% of the value in round 2.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
