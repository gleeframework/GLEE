"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you""
}
```

I've taken into account the 5% decrease in value from the first round and the 5% decrease from the second round, and I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than before, while still trying to get a good share for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
