"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which is a generous offer, considering I'm the first to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's gain, I'm in a stronger position now. I'll accept his offer.
