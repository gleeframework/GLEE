"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. If Bob accepts, we can end the game and move on to other things."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too much for me, Bob. I'll need to get a better deal to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3, taking into account the further decrease in value due to inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is my best offer so far. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice. It's a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value due to inflation, a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. You got me. 50/50 it is. Let's end the game.""
}
```"
