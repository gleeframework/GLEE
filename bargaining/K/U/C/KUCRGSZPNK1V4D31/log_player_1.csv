"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being too greedy, does he?

Considering the new values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I need to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and meet Bob halfway, hoping he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively decent split, and I don't want to risk losing out on a significant portion of the remaining amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like I'll get $4,000 and Bob will get $6,000. Not bad, considering the circumstances!"
