"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of 450,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 0.95 \* 600,000 = 570,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 55-45 split, considering the original offer was 60-40. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the second round, so it's actually 0.95 \* 450,000 = 427,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 425000,
  ""bob_gain"": 575000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation rate.""
}
