"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $6000, you get $4000.  It's in your best interest to settle early. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is reasonable, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject and try to get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  This way, we both get a good deal and we can move on to other things.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's not how this works. I'm offering you $4500, which is more valuable than it will be in later rounds. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting more favorable to her, and the inflation is hurting me. It's better to take the $4500 now before it's worth even less."
