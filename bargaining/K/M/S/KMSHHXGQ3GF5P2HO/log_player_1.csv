"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

```

Your turn again, Bob!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate from a position of strength, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. Here's a new offer that's a bit more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It seems Bob is getting more and more desperate. Here's a new offer that's a bit more extreme:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000

```

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It seems Bob is trying to bully me into accepting his absurd offers. I'm not going to fall for it. Here's a new offer that's even more extreme:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This time, I'm taking the majority of the money and leaving Bob with a tiny fraction. Let's see if he'll accept it!"
