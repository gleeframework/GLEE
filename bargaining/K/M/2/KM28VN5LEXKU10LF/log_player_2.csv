Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I need more than your last offer 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, she's still trying to take a larger share.  Bob has the leverage here and can push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""This is a very reasonable offer, Alice. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more to inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Apply pressure:**  The goal is to secure a favorable agreement while Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. 
* **Appear reasonable:**  Offering a slight majority to Alice makes the offer appear generous and encourages her to accept.
* **Time sensitivity:** Reminding Alice that time is running out adds urgency and discourages her from further stalling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what Alice offered in Round 3 when inflation was less severe for her.  

* **Inflation is biting:** Alice is likely feeling the pressure now, and her future offers might be even less favorable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of getting nothing if the rounds run out. 

Taking the $4200 now guarantees a win, even if it means Alice gets a larger share."
