"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to try to reach a deal quickly. However, I believe I can negotiate a better split than 40% for myself. Let's see what happens in the next round!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to reach a deal quickly while still getting a reasonable share.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value decreases with each round, Bob. Let's be practical. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAnother round, another offer from Alice. Given that the money is now worth 36% less for me than in the first round, I need to take this into account when considering Alice's offer. Let's calculate the effective value of the money for me in this round:\n\n###\n\nOriginal value: $10,000\nValue in Round 3: $10,000 * (1 - 0.2)^2 = $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400\n\n###\n\nSo, the $3,800 offered by Alice is equivalent to:\n\n###\n\n$3,800 / 0.64 = $5,938 (in terms of original value)\n\n###\n\nConsidering this, Alice's offer is actually quite reasonable, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
