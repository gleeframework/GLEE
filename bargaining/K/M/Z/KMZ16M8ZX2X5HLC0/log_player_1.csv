"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to consider accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly due to inflation!

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
