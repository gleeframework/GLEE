"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, Bob. You get $45 and I get $55. It's a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% inflation rate for me is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than $45."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to be strategic with my offer, taking into account the inflation rate that affects me but not Alice. Since the money is now worth 5% less to me than in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more than half to compensate for the loss in value over potential future rounds, while still being somewhat reasonable to avoid immediate rejection.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'll take a little less this time.  $52 for me and $48 for you.  It's the best offer you'll get with the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current situation and the impact of inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action. The money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round, and this offer matches what I proposed in the previous round but got rejected. It's reasonable to accept this to avoid further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
