"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree early. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I can potentially get a better deal by waiting.  The inflation rate is higher for me, so my gains will be larger in future rounds."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, this way we both get the most out of the deal before inflation hits too hard.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is a slightly better deal for you than before. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is slightly better than Alice's previous offer, the inflation still heavily impacts me. I believe I can get a better deal in the future rounds by taking advantage of the higher inflation rate on my end."

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is affecting me significantly, but I believe I can still get a more favorable split."
