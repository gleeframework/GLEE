"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. It's a fair split, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way. No need for further rounds! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a bold move!

However, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'd rather aim for a higher amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll let Bob know that I'm not interested in the even split just yet. It's his turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a good deal, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or not!"
