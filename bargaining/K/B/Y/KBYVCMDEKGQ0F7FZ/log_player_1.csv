"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a slightly bigger share this time. But I'll be willing to negotiate if you have a better offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to accept it since it's my only option. The money I'll get is still worth 95% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $950,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
