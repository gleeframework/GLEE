"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair but not too aggressive offer in the first round. This should hopefully make Bob think about accepting, but also leave room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation makes this a reasonable offer.  It's a 50/50 split, and any further negotiation could lead to a worse outcome due to the decreasing value of the money."
