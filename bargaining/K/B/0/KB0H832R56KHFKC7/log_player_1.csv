Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was far too skewed. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by passing on your offer.  We need to reach an agreement quickly with the looming inflation.

# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out, and the value is slipping away with every passing moment.  Your offer was close, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This 52/48 split is my final offer. Let's settle this now and walk away with something substantial.
