""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was far too skewed. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by passing on your offer.  We need to reach an agreement quickly with the looming inflation.""

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is still too uneven. This offer reflects a more balanced approach, considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

# Alice gain: 5500
