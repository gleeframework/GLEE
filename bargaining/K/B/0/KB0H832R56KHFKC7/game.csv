4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, that initial offer was far too skewed. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by passing on your offer.  We need to reach an agreement quickly with the looming inflation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is still too uneven. This offer reflects a more balanced approach, considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, time is running out, and the value is slipping away with every passing moment.  Your offer was close, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This 52/48 split is my final offer. Let's settle this now and walk away with something substantial.",Bob,4,
