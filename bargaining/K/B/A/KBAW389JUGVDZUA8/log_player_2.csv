This is a tough one, but with time running out, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are at round 7 out of 12.  If I reject this, there's a real risk we won't reach an agreement in time and both get nothing.
* **Declining Offers:** Alice's offers have been declining, and my rejections haven't resulted in significant movement towards a 50/50 split.
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting guarantees me $400,000. Rejecting risks getting $0.

While I believe a more even split is fairer, the risk of ending up with nothing outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal at this stage."
