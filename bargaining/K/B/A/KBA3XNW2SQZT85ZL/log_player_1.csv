Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me a bit, but I'm willing to negotiate. I think this is a fair starting point considering the inflation factor.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  The inflation rate is hurting me, and it's likely that Bob will only offer me less in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
