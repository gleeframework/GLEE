"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair here, Bob. Take the 10,000 and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is tempting in the first round, it's important to remember that the money loses value for Bob with each passing round.  It's worth holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10. It's a fair start, and we both get a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not going to let you walk away with the majority of the money.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still very lopsided in her favor.  Even with the inflation, it's better for Bob to hold out for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  Let's make a deal.  This is my final offer before I start losing money too.  Take the 100,000 and let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is slightly better than in the first round, Bob is still losing too much to inflation.  It's important to keep pushing for a more equitable deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""We're getting close to the end, Alice.  Let's split it 60/40.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both avoid losing too much to inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are getting really close to the end of the game. I'm willing to give you 150,000, but this is my final offer. Take it, or we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

The offer is still heavily skewed towards Alice.  With the money losing value so quickly for Bob, it's crucial to hold out for a more balanced split.  There are only a few rounds left, and the pressure is on, but it's better to risk it than to settle for such a poor outcome."

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the end.  Let's cut our losses and split it evenly.  It's the only way we both get something significant before it's all gone.""
