"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority this time. You can have a smaller share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the proposal, I'll have 4000 dollars, which is worth 90% of what I could have had in the previous round. Bob would have 6000 dollars, which is worth 95% of what he could have had in the previous round.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, but I'm willing to take it for now. I'll accept this offer.
