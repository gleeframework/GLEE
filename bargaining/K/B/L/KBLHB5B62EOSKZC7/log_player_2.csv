Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and end this before it's worth nothing. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50

```

Alice is right, the value is plummeting. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting nothing in a few more rounds.
