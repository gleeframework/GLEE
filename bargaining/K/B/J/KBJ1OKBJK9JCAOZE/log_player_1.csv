"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual value of the offer is:

* Alice gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67
* Bob gain: 4000

I accept this offer.
