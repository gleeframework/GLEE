"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $36.

I don't think Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving away all the power. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping some advantage for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 65, you can have 35. You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $35 is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $72.9 / 0.909 (since 100 * 0.909 = 90.9%) = $80.1.

I think Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, but I'm still not comfortable with giving him a 65% share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up yet. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have 30. I'm getting closer to my goal, and I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $30 is worth 59.5% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $30 / 0.691 (since 100 * 0.691 = 69.1%) = $43.3.

I think Bob's offer is getting quite aggressive, and I'm not comfortable with giving him a 70% share. I'll try to make a counteroffer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
