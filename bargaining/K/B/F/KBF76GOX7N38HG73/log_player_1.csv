"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, but I get a slight advantage for starting the negotiations. This ensures we both benefit before inflation eats into the value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both maximize our gains before inflation takes its toll. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I could try for a better deal in the next round, accepting Bob's offer now guarantees a fair outcome. With each round, the value decreases, and there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal later. A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise in this situation."
