I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
