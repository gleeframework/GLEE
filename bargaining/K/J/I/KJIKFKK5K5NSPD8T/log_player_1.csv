"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 in a 75:25 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but considering the decreasing value of money over time, it could be beneficial for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fairer distribution considering the decreasing value of the money, and hopefully we can both benefit from this agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
