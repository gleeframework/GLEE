"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 60-40 split right off the bat. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55-45.  This way we both get a fair share, and we can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can compromise too. 58-42 is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  58-42 is better than the 60-40 she offered before, and with the inflation, it's probably the best deal I'm going to get."
