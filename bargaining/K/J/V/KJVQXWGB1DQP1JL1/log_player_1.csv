I propose to take 990,000$ and leave 10,000$ for Bob. This way, I get a significant portion of the money, while giving Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept the offer."

I will reject this offer. While I have lost a significant amount of money due to inflation, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. With only a few rounds left, Bob might be more willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
