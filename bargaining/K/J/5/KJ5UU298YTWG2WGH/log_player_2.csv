"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```tool_code
Reason:While not the worst offer, Bob can likely get a better deal in later rounds as the inflation heavily impacts Alice's potential gains. 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, how about we meet in the middle somewhat?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the same.  It seems fair considering the circumstances. Don't drag this out! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```tool_code
Reason: Alice is getting desperate, sticking to her initial offer even though it's worth significantly less to her now.  Bob still has leverage and time to push for a better deal.
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer acknowledges the inflation impact while still being a good deal for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I'm lowering my demand slightly, but this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

```tool_code
Reason: While Alice is getting more desperate, her ""final offer"" is still not generous enough.  The inflation is quickly eroding her advantage, and Bob can afford to gamble on one more rejection.  There's a good chance Alice will be forced to make a much better offer in the next round to avoid walking away with nothing.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear time is not on your side.  This is my counter-offer. Take it, and you still get a decent share despite the inflation.""}"
