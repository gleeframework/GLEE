"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This ensures a large share for me in the first round, minimizing the impact of inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor. While this is a smaller share than my initial offer, it's still a significant amount, and it allows for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is a much smaller share than I initially hoped for, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, while rejecting it could lead to both of us getting nothing."
