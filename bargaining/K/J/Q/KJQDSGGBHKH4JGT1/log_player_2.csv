"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While 40 dollars is a decent start, it's worth taking a chance to potentially get more.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair. Let's see if you agree."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you 45, but I need 55 to make it worth my while 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm taking into account the inflation and Alice's diminishing gains. This offer is better than what I would get if we continue to reject each other."
