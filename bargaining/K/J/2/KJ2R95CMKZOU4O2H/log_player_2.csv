Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 40% of the money. Let's see what happens next round. Maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise. Plus, the inflation isn't too bad yet, so I can afford to wait it out for now. Bring on the next round!"
