Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I propose a division where I receive $80 and Alice receives $20. This takes into account the decreasing value of money with each round.""}"

Round 3

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 20. Let's split it 60/40, which gives you a significant gain and still leaves me with something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
