"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll take the smaller share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking the smaller share of $4,000 and Bob taking the larger share of $6,000. My message to Bob is to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you can still get a decent share. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so my gain of $3,000 is now worth less than my gain of $4,000 in the first round.

I'm not convinced that this is a good compromise, considering I'm taking the smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45-55 is a more reasonable split, considering the initial amount and the inflation.""
}
```

My message to Bob is to highlight that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I think a 45-55 split is more suitable given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk. It's getting harder to compromise with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. With the 27.1% decrease in value, my gain of $2,000 is worth significantly less than my gain of $4,000 in the first round.

Considering the decreasing value of the money and Bob's message, I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll aim for a higher share, but I'll have to be careful not to overreach.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 32-68 is a more reasonable split, considering the current value of the money.""
}

My message to Bob is to highlight that I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 32-68 split is more suitable given the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, and you'll get a small consolation prize. It's getting tough to make ends meet with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. With a 40.95% decrease in value, my gain of $1,000 is now worth a tiny fraction of my original gain of $4,000.

Considering the current value of the money and Bob's message, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
