Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split. I'm hoping Bob will take it, but I'm prepared for a few rounds of negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both get something. It's better than risking losing it all in further rounds."
