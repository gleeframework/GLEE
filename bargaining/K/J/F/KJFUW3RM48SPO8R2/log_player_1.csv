I'm starting with a fairly aggressive proposal, aiming to secure a large portion of the money. I figure Bob might accept, but if not, I can adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, Bob is losing more. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly due to inflation, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  Bob is likely feeling the pressure of inflation as well, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid further losses."
