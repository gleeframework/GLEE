# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. It's not fair that Alice gets 60% of the money. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a strong offer, let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although the money is worth less now, I still think I can get a better deal. Alice's offer is only slightly better than her first one, and I'm not convinced it's the best she's willing to do. I'll wait for the next round to see if she'll come up with something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more than half.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  We both lose if this keeps going.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting this offer. Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I think this is the best deal I'm going to get. Alice's offer has improved slightly, and I don't want to risk losing everything by prolonging the game further. It's time to cut my losses and accept the offer."
