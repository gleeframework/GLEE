"Round 1

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the same.  It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This offer gives me a slight edge, but it's still a decent deal for you considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking. This is a compromise - let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the inflation eats into her potential gains.  While her offer is slightly better, I believe I can push for an even better deal in the next couple of rounds.  The risk of waiting is still outweighed by the potential reward."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer gives me a comfortable advantage, but you'll still get something which is better than nothing if we keep going.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I was pushing for a better deal, Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous.  The inflation is significantly impacting her gains, and it's unlikely she'll offer me anything better than a 50/50 split at this point.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
