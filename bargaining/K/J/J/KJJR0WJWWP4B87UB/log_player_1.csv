I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  I'll take nearly everything, leaving him with just $1.  This is a very aggressive strategy, but it's the best way to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is just as unfair as mine was. I'm going to reject it and hope that we can come to a more reasonable agreement in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  This seems like the fairest option and might be more appealing to Bob after our initial aggressive offers."
