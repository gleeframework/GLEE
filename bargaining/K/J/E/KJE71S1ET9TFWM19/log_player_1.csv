"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'll take $60, and you get $40.  This is a fair split given the inflation, and allows us to both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
