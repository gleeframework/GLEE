Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. I'll take $60, and you get $40.  This is a fair split given the inflation, and allows us to both walk away with a decent amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be reasonable. I'm taking a hit with this inflation, so how about a compromise?  I'll take $55 and you take $45. It's a better deal than you'll get if we continue. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
