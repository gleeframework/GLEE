"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the 5% decrease in value, $2,000 is now worth 0.95 x $2,000 = $1,900.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not. I'll choose to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Let's calculate the value of the money in this round. Initially, $10,000 is worth 0.95^3 ≈ 0.8574 of its original value due to the 5% decrease in each of the first three rounds. So, $3,000 is worth approximately 0.8574 × $3,000 = $2,571.22.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not. I'll choose to reject it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

I'm offering Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself, splitting the remaining amount evenly."
