"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 60/40.  This gives you a fair share while still acknowledging the increasing disadvantage of waiting for the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
