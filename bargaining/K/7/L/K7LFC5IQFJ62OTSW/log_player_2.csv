"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair split, let's start with a good base 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure if Alice's offer is truly ""fair,"" and with inflation, it's better to see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can agree!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, no more negotiations 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher percentage, the inflation is hitting me hard.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round."
