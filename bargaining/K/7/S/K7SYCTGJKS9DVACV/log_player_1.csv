"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I should aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Bob's offer is 50/50, but I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting the money's value significantly. Since the money is worth less for me, I should aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. However, Bob's offer is a 55/45 split, which is a good deal considering the reduced value of the money.
