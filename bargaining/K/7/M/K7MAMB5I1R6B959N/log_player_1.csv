"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as the first proposer.  This allows for a decent initial gain while leaving room for potential negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a 55/45 split. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but it's still a favorable outcome for me.  It's likely Bob will accept given the increasing inflation and the fact that he didn't reach his desired outcome in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. With the inflation rate, the value of my share continues to decrease. It's more beneficial to secure this offer than to risk ending up with less in the following rounds."
