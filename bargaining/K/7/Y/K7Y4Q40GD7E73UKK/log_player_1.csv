"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This way, I'll get 80% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll consider the effective gains. 

For me, the effective gain would be 70 * 0.9 = 63 (since 10% less than the original 80).

For Bob, the gain remains 30.

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll accept Bob's offer.
