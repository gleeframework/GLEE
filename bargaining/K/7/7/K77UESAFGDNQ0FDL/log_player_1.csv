Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose and want to secure a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair 50/50 split, and I don't want to risk losing any more money to inflation."
