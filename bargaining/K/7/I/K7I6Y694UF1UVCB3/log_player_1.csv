"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $8000 * 0.8 = $6400. My gain is now worth less than Bob's gain, so I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This way, I'm still taking a significant portion of the money, but leaving Bob with a fair share."
