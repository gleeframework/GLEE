"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This offer gives Alice the majority of the money while still leaving Bob with a small amount. It's a starting point that might be appealing to Bob, especially since the money will be worth less to Alice with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. With each round, my share of the money will be worth less due to inflation. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me half the money, which is a better outcome than risking getting nothing in the end."
