"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I need to take that into account. I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: $3000 (same as before)
Bob's gain: $7000 * 0.95 = $6650 (5% less due to inflation)

Considering the adjusted values, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 75/25 split, especially considering the inflation effect."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking into account the inflation effect. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values considering the inflation effect:

My gain: $4500 (same as before)
Bob's gain: $5500 * 0.8554 (14.26% less due to inflation) = $4692.70

I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's given me a slightly larger share, I still think I can do better. With inflation, the actual values are $4500 for me and $4692.70 for Bob, which is still a 49.5/50.5 split. I'd like to aim for a better ratio."
