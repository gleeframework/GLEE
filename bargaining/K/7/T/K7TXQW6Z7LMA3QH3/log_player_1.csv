"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving $100,000 to Bob.  While this is a significant advantage for me, it's a reasonable starting point given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the inflation factor.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future."
