"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm offering Alice a fair share, but I'm aiming for a majority since I get to make the first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's a fair split and the money is getting less valuable each round. I'd rather take the sure thing."
