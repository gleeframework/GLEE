"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% and keeping 60% for myself, with a message to persuade him to accept this fair offer. Waiting for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. The game continues!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""My final compromise""
}

I'm making a slightly more generous offer than my first one, but still in my favor, with a message hinting that I'm not willing to go lower. Waiting for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, let's settle 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

Considering the significant effect of inflation, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and it's better to accept it rather than risking further devaluation. The game is over!"
