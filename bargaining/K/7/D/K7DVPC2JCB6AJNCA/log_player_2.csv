Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking. This is a fair deal considering the rapid devaluation. Let's not let greed make us both losers. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is better than the previous one, time is becoming a serious factor for Bob. However, Alice knows the pressure is on Bob due to the faster inflation.  Rejecting this might push Alice to a more substantial offer in the next round. It's a gamble, but Bob's bargaining power diminishes quickly with each round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 425000, ""alice_gain"": 575000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now.  This offer is a compromise considering the time pressure and the devaluation.  Don't let this opportunity slip away.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is mounting for Bob. He needs to signal a willingness to negotiate but also convey the urgency of the situation.  This offer is a slight increase for Alice, showing movement, but also emphasizes the risk of losing everything as time runs out."
