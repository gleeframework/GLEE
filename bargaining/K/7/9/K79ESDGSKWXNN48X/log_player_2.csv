Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more now, but you'll have the advantage later.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. I'm willing to negotiate for a more favorable outcome."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the sentiment Alice, but let's be practical. My turn for a slight advantage now, with the understanding that the game dynamics shift later.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's stop wasting time. A clean 50/50 split. This ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is right, it's time to stop messing around. A guaranteed 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing as inflation diminishes the returns."
