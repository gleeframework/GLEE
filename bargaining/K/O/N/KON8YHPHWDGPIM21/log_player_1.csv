"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still have the same amount of purchasing power from my perspective. I'll consider Bob's offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I accept Bob's offer."
