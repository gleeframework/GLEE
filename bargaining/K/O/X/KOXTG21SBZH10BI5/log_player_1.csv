"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% to 10% split, with me getting 900,000$ and Bob getting 100,000$. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for more, but I'm not giving up yet""
}
```

I'm now proposing a 80% to 20% split, with me getting 800,000$ and Bob getting 200,000$. I'm acknowledging Bob's push for more, but I'm not willing to give up that much."

}
```

I'm now proposing a 70% to 30% split, with me getting 700,000$ and Bob getting 300,000$. I'm implying that Bob is getting weaker in his negotiation, and I'm taking advantage of that."
