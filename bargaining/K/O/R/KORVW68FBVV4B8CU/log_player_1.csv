Let's see if Bob likes a 90/10 split.  I figure I can offer him a little and still get most of the money.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I'm taking a big hit on the value of my share, 5000 is still better than nothing. I'm not sure what Bob's deal is with the 10% inflation, but I'm willing to take the 50/50 split."
