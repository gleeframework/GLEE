Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for me in this game.  While I think a 50/50 split is fair in principle, it doesn't account for the fact that my potential gains shrink with each round. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take a slightly smaller increase than my last offer, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4537 
# Alice gain: 5463
