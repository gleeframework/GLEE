"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I agree with a 60/40 split, but let's reverse the shares from Bob's proposal. I believe this is more reasonable considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
