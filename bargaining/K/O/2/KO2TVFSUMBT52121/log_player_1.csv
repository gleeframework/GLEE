I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but leaving Bob with something to consider.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer or if he thinks he can get more!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept such an unfair deal!  It's my turn to make an offer now.  Let's see if we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split. I believe this is a fairer division, and I hope Bob will see it that way."
