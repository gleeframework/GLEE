"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with $80. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you have to take it now! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, especially since the offer is still quite lopsided in Bob's favor. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to be even more cautious with my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, Bob. Don't expect me to give away too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than in his previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a fair share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. This is a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, especially since the offer is still slightly lopsided in Bob's favor. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the money is worth even less now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be even more careful with my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle again!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and ending the game quickly. I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than in my previous offer, but still trying to get a fair share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to split it down the middle, Alice. No more games! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more reasonable now!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Since the money is worth significantly less now, I think splitting it down the middle is a fair deal. It's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting even less. I'll take the $50 and call it a day!"
