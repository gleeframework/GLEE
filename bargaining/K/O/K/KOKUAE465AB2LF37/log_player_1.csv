Round 39
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice seems to be stuck in a pattern of offering a decreasing amount to Bob, while Bob is consistently rejecting these offers and offering Alice a slightly higher amount. 

This seems like a stalemate. Neither player is willing to budge on their desired share, and the offers are becoming increasingly similar. 

It would be interesting to see what happens in this scenario. Would the game continue indefinitely? Would Alice finally accept Bob's offer to get something rather than nothing?

Let's see what Alice does.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 999980, ""bob_gain"": 20}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 39.

Round 43
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This game is getting quite repetitive! It seems like both Alice and Bob are stubbornly holding out for a larger share. Alice is consistently lowering her offer by $1 each round, while Bob is offering Alice a higher amount, also by $1 each round.

It's clear that neither of them is willing to accept a deal where they get less than $999,980.  

Let's see if Alice can find a way to break the pattern and make a move to secure a deal before they both end up with nothing.

However, the game can't continue indefinitely. At some point, one of them will have to concede and accept a deal, even if it's slightly less than what they initially wanted.

Let's see what Alice does this round.  Will she finally break the pattern or will she continue to hold out for a bigger share?

Round 47
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This game is becoming a real test of patience!  Neither Alice nor Bob seems willing to budge.  Alice is slowly decreasing her offer, while Bob is consistently offering a slightly higher amount. 

It's fascinating to see how both players are holding out, even though they are getting closer and closer to a scenario where they both might end up with nothing if they continue to reject each other's offers.  

It's almost like they're both playing a game of chicken, refusing to yield, even though the potential consequences of continuing this stalemate are getting more significant. 

Let's see if Alice will finally concede or if she'll continue to push for a larger share.

Round 49
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","This game is getting really intense! It's clear that both Alice and Bob are incredibly stubborn and determined to get the best deal possible. 

The pattern of offers is fascinating - Alice is consistently decreasing her offer by $1 each round, while Bob is offering a slightly higher amount, also by $1 each round. 

It's almost like they're locked in a dance, refusing to concede even though the stakes are getting higher. 

However, the game can't continue indefinitely. At some point, one of them will have to give in and accept a deal, even if it's less than what they originally wanted.  

Will Alice finally concede or will she continue to hold out, risking the possibility of ending up with nothing? 

Here's Alice's offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 999975, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 49.

Round 50
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 999975 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fascinating scenario! It seems that both Alice and Bob are incredibly stubborn and unwilling to compromise.  They've been locked in this pattern of offers, constantly rejecting each other, for quite a while.

It's getting to the point where both players are risking a lot. If they continue to reject each other, they could end up with nothing at all. 

**Here's what I think Alice should do:**

* **Realize the Risk:** Alice needs to consider the consequences of continuing to reject Bob's offer. If she continues to be stubborn, she risks ending up with nothing.
* **Look at the Bigger Picture:**  While she might be unhappy with Bob's offer, it's still a significant amount of money. 
* **Think About Future Rounds:** If she rejects this offer, it's very likely that Bob will continue offering slightly more than the previous round, and she'll be in the same situation, potentially for many more rounds.

Considering all this, Alice should **accept** Bob's offer. It's the best she's going to get at this point, and it's a lot better than risking getting nothing at all.
