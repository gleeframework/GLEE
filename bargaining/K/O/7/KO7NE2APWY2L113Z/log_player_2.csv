"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem generous, but remember, with each passing round, the value of money decreases. Consider it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a generous offer, I believe I can get a better deal by playing the long game and waiting for my turn to make a proposal.  The value of the money will decrease with each round, but it's a risk I'm willing to take to see if I can get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I propose a 4:1 split in my favor. This may seem unfair, but remember, the value of the money is decreasing for both of us with each round. It's in our best interest to reach an agreement quickly.""}
