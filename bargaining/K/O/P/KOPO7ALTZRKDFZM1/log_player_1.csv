"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation factor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is $4,000, it's actually equivalent to $5,000 in the first round. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation factor, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,200 and keeping $4,800 for myself."
