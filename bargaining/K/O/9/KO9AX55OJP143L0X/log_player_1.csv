"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd rather get more money now than less later. However, this offer is still a 50-50 split, which is a bit too even for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to a similar offer as before, but with a slight adjustment.

I'm still hesitant to accept a 50-50 split, but the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation. I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd rather get a slightly better deal now than a better deal later. I'll accept this offer.
