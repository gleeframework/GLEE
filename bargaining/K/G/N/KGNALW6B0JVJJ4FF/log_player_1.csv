"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split.  Let's take 600k for me and 400k for you. This seems like a fairer way to start. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
