"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's get this done before we lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

I'm aiming to secure a better deal than this.  While waiting is risky due to inflation, I believe Bob might be willing to concede more to avoid losing everything."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 52.5/47.5.  We're losing too much money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

Bob is getting closer, but I need to hold out for a better split. The risk of losing everything is increasing, but so is the potential loss from settling for a suboptimal deal."
