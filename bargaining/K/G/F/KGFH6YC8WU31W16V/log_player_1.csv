Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While this is the same offer Bob gave in Round 1, the inflation heavily impacts him. Accepting now guarantees a decent share for Alice before inflation further eats into the potential gains. Delaying further risks Bob offering even less favorable terms, putting Alice in a weaker position."
