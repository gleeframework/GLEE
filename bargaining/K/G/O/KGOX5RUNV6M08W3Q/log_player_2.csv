Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original split, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly, especially for me (Bob). While her offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger share while it still holds decent value.  If I continue to reject offers around this amount, she'll be forced to make a better offer soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time with this back and forth.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly before the inflation eats away at the value any further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Given the rapid inflation, it's getting riskier to keep pushing for a significantly larger share. Offering a 50/50 split accomplishes a few things:

* **Shows Flexibility:** It demonstrates I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her position.
* **Highlights Urgency:**  It underscores that the shrinking pot of money hurts us both.
* **Appeals to Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, which could make Alice more likely to accept. 

If she rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider accepting a less favorable split in the next couple of rounds before the inflation makes the entire situation pointless."
