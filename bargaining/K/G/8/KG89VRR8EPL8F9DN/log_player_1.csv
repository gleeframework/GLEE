"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This offer is a fair starting point. I believe it's likely Bob will accept, as he's getting something.  However, I'm also aware of the inflation rates and know I need to secure a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal.  Even with the inflation, I still have a better chance of getting a larger share by continuing the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and the inflation rates. It should still be attractive to Bob while securing a decent share for me, especially considering the potential for further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, especially for me. Bob's offer, while not ideal, is the best I can realistically expect at this point.  I'm taking the loss and ending the game."
