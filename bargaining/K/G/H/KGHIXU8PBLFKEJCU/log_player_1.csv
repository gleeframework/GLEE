Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  We both lose money with each passing round. My offer is still fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is drastically undervaluing the impact of inflation on his gains. While he's right that we both lose in a protracted negotiation, the losses are much steeper on his end. I'm willing to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob, and it's slipping away from you. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems to be stuck on the initial split, likely hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress. This offer is a significant concession on my part, designed to convey urgency while still giving me a majority share. It's a calculated risk, but Bob needs to understand that time is working against him more than me."
