"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and equal division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I can calculate that the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 40 / 0.8 = 50
Bob gain: 60 / 0.8 = 75

This is a worse deal for me than the original 50-50 split, but I'll have to consider it. Since Bob's offer is better for him than my original offer, I'm not sure if he'll make a better offer next round. I'll reject this offer for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60% to him, I'll try to counter that by offering a smaller share to Bob. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

This offer is a bit more favorable to me than the original 50-50 split, but still leaves Bob with a significant share."
