Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I was hoping for a more generous share, especially considering the initial amount was 10,000$.
