"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, as I'm taking the risk of this offer being rejected. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's proposal is the best one. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a new one:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the 60/40 split. How about 55/45?""}

I'm hoping that Bob will consider my revised proposal and be willing to meet me halfway."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's try again, 52/48 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the remaining $100, which is $52, and Bob gets the remaining 48%, which is $48."
