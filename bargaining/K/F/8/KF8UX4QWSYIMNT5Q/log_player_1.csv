"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a relatively fair split. The message is a brief explanation of my reasoning, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting the larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer ensures you get more than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer of 55% for me is lower than my initial proposal of 60%, and I'm willing to take the risk of waiting another round to try to get closer to my original offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob 50% of the money, but due to inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased. I'll take this into account when making my offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.


{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair adjustment""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 42% of the money, which is a slight decrease from his previous offer of 45%. However, considering the effects of inflation, this offer is relatively fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. Let's see how he reacts!"
