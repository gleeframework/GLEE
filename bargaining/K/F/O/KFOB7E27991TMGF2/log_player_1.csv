"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that I'm taking a bigger hit on the money in each round. Let's be reasonable and find a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I'm still getting a raw deal with 45% of the money, considering the inflation is affecting me more severely. I'd like to propose a new offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split, considering the inflation is affecting us both equally now""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it."
