"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000$ for myself and leaving 100,000$ for Bob. This ensures I get the majority, but also allows for a chance to potentially negotiate in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 800,000$, while increasing Bob's to 200,000$. This keeps a larger share for me, while offering a significant increase for Bob in hopes of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still too low, but he's getting closer. I'm not going to accept just yet, but I'm feeling hopeful that we can come to an agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm further lowering my offer to 700,000$, while increasing Bob's to 300,000$. This is a big concession on my part, but I think it's necessary to show Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is really starting to bite into Bob's share.  It's better to accept now and get something, rather than risk getting nothing at all."
