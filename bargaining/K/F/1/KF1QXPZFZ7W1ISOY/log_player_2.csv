"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is just a test, Bob. I'm being generous. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This offer is ridiculously unfair.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 990000,
""alice_gain"": 10000,
""message"": ""Alice, I think we can both do better than your last offer.  Let's start with a more equitable split.  I'm willing to give you a small share to show good faith, but I'm not giving away the whole pie.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair share, but your last offer was too low. I'm willing to give you a substantial amount, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Let's work together to find a reasonable solution. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still very lopsided in her favor.  While it's better than her first offer, I believe we can find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, and it ensures we both get a significant share.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away!""
