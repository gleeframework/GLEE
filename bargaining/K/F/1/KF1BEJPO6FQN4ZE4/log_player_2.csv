"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. I think this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While it seems ""fair"" at first glance, I can potentially get a better deal for myself by seeing what Alice is willing to offer in the next round. Remember, I have 12 rounds to reach a deal, and the value of the money decreases more for Alice than it does for me. I'll see if I can negotiate a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's see if we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's important we reach a deal soon. I'm offering you a bit more this time, but the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While Alice is offering a slightly larger share, I still believe I can negotiate a more favorable deal. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases for Alice, increasing my leverage. I'm confident I can get closer to a 60/40 split, or even better, by waiting."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic.  The value of the money is decreasing faster for you than it is for me. Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both, but keep in mind that time is running out for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out if we don't agree now.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. While a 50/50 split seems appealing on the surface, remember that Alice's share is worth significantly less than mine due to the inflation effect.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to see if Alice is willing to budge on her offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. We're both losing out with each passing round. I'm willing to offer you a fair share, but I need a deal that benefits me as well.  Let's be realistic and agree on a split that reflects the current value of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm taking a significant hit due to the inflation, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.  If we don't agree now, we both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is emphasizing the urgency and the risk of getting nothing, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I know the money is worth significantly less for Alice than for me, and I'm confident I can still get a better split. I'm willing to see if she's truly willing to walk away with nothing or if she'll make a final concession in the next round."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the end. I'm willing to offer you a fair share, but I need a deal that reflects the reality of the situation. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for you, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal if we continue to negotiate. Let's find a solution before we both lose out completely.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation. This is my absolute last offer, we need to make a deal now! 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is getting desperate and emphasizes this as her final offer, I'm still not satisfied. The value of her share is considerably lower due to inflation, and I know I can push for a more favorable deal. I'm confident I can secure a better split in the next round or even in the final round, as Alice's stake will continue to depreciate rapidly."

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. The value of the money is plummeting for you with every passing round. It's in both of our best interests to reach a deal now. I'm willing to offer you a fair share, but I need a deal that reflects the current situation. This is my final offer. Let's avoid losing everything.""}
