"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 160,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as I'm getting a relatively small share of the remaining amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent amount""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not budging on my share 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 100,000 is now worth approximately 51,200.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'd rather not give up too much more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

I'm getting desperate, but I'd rather not give up too much more. This offer is still a bit too low for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal this way""

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny, tiny share, but I'm not budging 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 79.03% less than in the first round, my gain of 10,000 is now worth approximately 2,008.

I'm running out of options, and this offer is almost laughable. I'd rather take a small chance on a better deal than settle for this tiny share.
