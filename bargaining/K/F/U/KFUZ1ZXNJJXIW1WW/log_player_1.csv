"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable proposal""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced proposal, let's give it a shot! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

After calculating the new values, I see that the total amount is now $900,000 (due to 10% inflation).

With Bob's offer, I would gain $450,000, which is worth 50% of the current $900,000, or $450,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
