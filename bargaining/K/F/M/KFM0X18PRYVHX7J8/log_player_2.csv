{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, that's not a fair start.  I'm proposing a more equitable split, considering the inflation working against you. Let's be reasonable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take less than my initial offer, but I'm not going to accept a split that favors you too heavily. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's crucial to remember the rapid inflation working against me. Each round significantly diminishes the value of the potential winnings.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means gambling on Alice being desperate in the next round. There's a chance she offers more, but there's also a chance the offer gets worse, and the money will be worth even less.
* **Present Value:** A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting $400,000 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better offer next round that's worth significantly less due to inflation. 

**It's a tough decision, but in this scenario, accepting the current offer mitigates risk and secures a reasonable sum considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money.**"
