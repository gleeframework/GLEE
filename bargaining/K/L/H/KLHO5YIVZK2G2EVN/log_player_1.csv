"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but still allows Bob a small share. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it shows I'm willing to negotiate while also prioritizing my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise and ensures we both receive an equal amount."
