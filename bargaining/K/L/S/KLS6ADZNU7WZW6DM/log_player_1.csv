"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but it leaves some for Bob, hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even though I'm gaining less than in the first round, I still have 10 more rounds to negotiate. I want to see what Bob is willing to offer as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from round 1, hoping that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. This offer still gives me a significant share of the money, but it shows I'm willing to compromise."
