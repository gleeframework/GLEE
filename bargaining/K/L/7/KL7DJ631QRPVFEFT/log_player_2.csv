Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's compromise. I'll take a little less than my original offer.  55/45 sound good?

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. The deal is getting worse with every round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting a 50/50 split in round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer will significantly decrease the overall payout for both of us.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in a later round is risky. Alice might not budge, and we'd be left with an even smaller pie to split.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal, is fair. It avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if we both continue to play hardball. 

It's time to cut our losses due to inflation and secure a reasonable payout.
