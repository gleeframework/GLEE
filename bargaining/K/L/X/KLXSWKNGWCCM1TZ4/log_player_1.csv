"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3800 in the original terms.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round (95% * 95% = 90.25%). So, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still looking for a fair deal""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $3000 is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%). So, it's equivalent to $8527.40 in the original terms.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round. Considering this, my proposal for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3300,
  ""bob_gain"": 6700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something more substantial""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
