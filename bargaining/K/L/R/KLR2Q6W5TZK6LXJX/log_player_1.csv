"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to propose a very uneven split, giving myself almost everything. Since this is the first round, I'm betting that Bob will be hesitant to reject my offer and risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and gives me a significant amount of money. While I'm disappointed that I didn't get my initial proposal, I realize that rejecting this offer risks ending up with nothing in the next round. It's better to take the guaranteed 50% now."
