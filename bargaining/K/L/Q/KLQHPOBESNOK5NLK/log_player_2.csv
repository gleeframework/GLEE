Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean I get even less than half of the initial value due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, knowing my position weakens with each round. It's a gamble, but I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not impressed 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough decision, but with time running out, I need to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly not budging much, and the value of the money for me is decreasing rapidly. Accepting this offer gives me something, while rejecting it risks getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
