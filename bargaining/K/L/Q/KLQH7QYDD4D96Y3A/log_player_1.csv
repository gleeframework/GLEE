"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 60% of the initial amount, leaving you with 40%. You can do better?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split, each receiving $500,000. It's fair and avoids potential disagreements. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less. This is a good opportunity to negotiate.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""An equal split is too generous for me, considering the inflation. I'll propose again.""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round. I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% this time, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
