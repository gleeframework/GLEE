Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is my bottom line.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of Bob's potential gains is decreasing rapidly. While my buying power remains the same, his is eroding with every round. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a larger share, waiting for a significantly better offer from Bob is risky.  He's becoming increasingly motivated to close a deal.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting means gambling on Bob's future offers, which might not be any better, especially considering the inflation working against him."
