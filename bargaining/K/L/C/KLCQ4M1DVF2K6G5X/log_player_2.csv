Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Since we're playing with inflation, this is a good starting point for a negotiation.  Let's see what Alice thinks."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is slightly better than my previous offer, and with each round the value of the money is decreasing for her.  It's a good deal for me considering the inflation factor. Let's take it!"
