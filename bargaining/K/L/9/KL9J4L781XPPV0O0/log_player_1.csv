"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now, $5,000 is equivalent to $4,500 in the first round's value. I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll play it safe for now.
