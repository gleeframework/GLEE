"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation.

I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low, I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and passing the baton to him to make a new proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still a fair compromise considering the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being a tough negotiator.

Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll think carefully about this one. I'm not thrilled with the numbers, but I don't want to risk going lower. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too close to your previous offer, I'm not budging yet!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping he'll come back with something better."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation and the previous offers. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the sweet spot, let's find a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $510,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
