90.0,10.0,I think it's fair for me to take a larger share since I'm taking the risk of starting the negotiation. I hope we can come to an agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable, I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  Remember, the value decreases with each round, so it's in our best interest to settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than 30%.  Let's meet in the middle - 60/40 split seems fair considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, time is running out. I'm increasing my offer to 55/45.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the fact that the value keeps decreasing for you. Let's close the deal.",Bob,4,
