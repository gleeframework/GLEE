{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable, I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  Remember, the value decreases with each round, so it's in our best interest to settle this quickly.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than 30%.  Let's meet in the middle - 60/40 split seems fair considering the inflation.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 4
