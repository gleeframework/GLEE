"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and leave Bob with $10. This is a good starting point, as I believe it's fair to take a larger share given that I'm the one initiating the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose to take $80 and leave Bob with $20.  Since my previous offer was rejected, I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to ensure a deal. However, I still believe it's important to secure a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Although this offer is better than the last round, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm willing to compromise further and offer Bob $30, but I still need to secure a reasonable amount for myself. The inflation is starting to take a serious toll, and I need to make a deal before the money becomes practically worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting risky, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. My losses due to inflation are significant, but I'm not giving up yet. I need to make a deal, but I want to ensure I get a fair share of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm getting desperate now. Inflation is making the remaining money worth less and less, and the risk of getting nothing is becoming very real. I'm willing to drop my share to $60, hoping Bob will finally accept and we can both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough choice, but I have to accept. Inflation has eaten away at my potential earnings, and the risk of getting nothing is too high. Even though it's less than I initially wanted, at least I'm getting something."
