I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he accepts and we can both get a good chunk of the money. I'm taking 90% for myself, hoping to secure a large portion before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is less generous than my initial offer, and I'm not sure if he understands the effect of inflation.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more balanced offer this time, still giving myself the majority but increasing Bob's share to see if it's more appealing. I'm also aware of the inflation, so I'm trying to secure a good amount before it devalues further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not convinced Bob is fully understanding the impact of inflation. While his offer is better than the previous round, it's still not fair given the rate at which my gains are being devalued. I'm going to reject again and see if I can get a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The inflation is hitting hard now, so I'm going to take a bigger risk and offer Bob a much larger share of the money. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and avoid the risk of further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is better than the previous round for me.  Inflation is making the money worth less and less, and I am not sure if I can get a better deal.  I will accept this offer, but I hope Bob is learning about the value of money."
