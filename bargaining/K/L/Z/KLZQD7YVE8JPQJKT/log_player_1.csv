"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 4000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 3800. Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is 5400.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
