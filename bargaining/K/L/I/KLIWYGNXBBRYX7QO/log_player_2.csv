Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice.  I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.  Let's avoid letting inflation eat away at our potential gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward, considering the inflation.  Let's not risk losing more money with further negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the more we both lose. A 50/50 split now is better than risking a worse offer later when the value has diminished further.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to accept anything less than 50% at this point. She knows time is on her side due to the difference in inflation rates.

It's a compromise, but in this scenario, accepting the 50/50 split minimizes potential losses.
