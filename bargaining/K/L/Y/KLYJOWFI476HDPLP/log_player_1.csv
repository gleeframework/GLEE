"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm confident he'll see the value in accepting my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $400,000.

I'm not sure if I want to split it 50/50, but it's a fair offer and it's getting late in the game. I'll accept Bob's offer.
