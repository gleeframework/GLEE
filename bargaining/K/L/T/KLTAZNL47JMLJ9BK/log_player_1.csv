I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  It's a pretty generous offer considering the 12 rounds and inflation factor. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is insulting! I'm not going to accept a measly 100,000, especially with inflation eating away at my gains. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer 800,000 to me, and 200,000 to Bob. This is a more even split than before, but I still need to protect my share against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still playing games! I won't accept a 200,000 offer, especially with the inflation factor. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 to myself, and 300,000 to Bob. This is a good compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that we only have 7 rounds left!  Let's see if he'll finally take a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly stubborn. This offer is still way too low, especially considering the inflation. I'm going to stick to my guns and see if he comes to his senses in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still taking a hit from inflation, but I'm offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob.  We only have six rounds left, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still ridiculous.  I know that inflation is hurting me, but I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're getting dangerously close to the end. I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the most fair offer I can make while still trying to protect myself from inflation. We need to agree now, or we'll both lose everything."
