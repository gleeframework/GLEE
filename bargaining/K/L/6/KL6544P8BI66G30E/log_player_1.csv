"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 80:20 ratio, with you receiving $20. I believe this is fair given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an even split.  This way we both get the maximum possible value from the money, as the value continues to decrease for me with each round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
