"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor, I'll be generous""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I want more for myself 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have 60 dollars, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, so he'll have 64 dollars (80 * 0.8).

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I think I can do better. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's previous offer in mind, I'll make a new proposal. Since I rejected his offer, I'm hoping to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split, no more negotiating""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be more appealing to Bob after my rejection of his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small piece of the pie, but I want the majority 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! With the inflation rate, Bob's gain is now worth significantly less than before, so I need to consider this new information.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have 60 dollars. Bob's gain, however, is worth 51.2 dollars (75 * 0.672).

Considering the reduced value of Bob's gain, I think this offer is more reasonable. I'll decide to accept this offer.
