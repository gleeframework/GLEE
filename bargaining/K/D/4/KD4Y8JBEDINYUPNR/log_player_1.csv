I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This way, Alice gets a larger share, but there is still a chance that Bob will accept the offer.  It's important to start with a good offer to make sure we both get something!"

This way, I still get a good share of the money, and there's a chance that Bob will finally accept."

While the offer is getting closer to 50/50, I'm still not happy with the split. I'm aware that the inflation is taking its toll, but I still believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. I will try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
