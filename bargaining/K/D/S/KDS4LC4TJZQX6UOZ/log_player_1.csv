"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
