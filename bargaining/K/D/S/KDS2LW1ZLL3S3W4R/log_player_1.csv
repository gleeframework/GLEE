"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering 70% of the original $100, which is $70, and leaving 30% for Bob, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

In this round, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $40 in the first round, considering the 20% inflation.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

My new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm offering 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and leaving 60% for Bob, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking. However, the numbers in Bob's offer seem to be the same as in the previous round, which means the value of Bob's gain hasn't changed, but the value of my gain has decreased.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer, since it's the same as before and the value of my gain has decreased.
