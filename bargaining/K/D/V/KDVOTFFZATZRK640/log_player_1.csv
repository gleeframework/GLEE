"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a slightly more even split.  I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share too.  Let's work together and end this game on good terms. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my own gain with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
