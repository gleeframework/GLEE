It's a good start, but I want to see if I can get a better deal! Let's see what Alice proposes next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's flip the script and see if Alice is willing to accept a slightly better deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is being stubborn.  I'm still going to hold out for a better deal, even though the money is worth less now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm raising my stake a bit more, hoping Alice will see that we need to reach an agreement soon before the value of the money drops even further."
