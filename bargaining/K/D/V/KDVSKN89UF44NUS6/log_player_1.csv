"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, while Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of its original value.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob this time, hoping he'll accept. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $420,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, while Bob's gain of $580,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value.

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with a lower value.
