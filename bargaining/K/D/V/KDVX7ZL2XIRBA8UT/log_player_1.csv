"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start with a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. The money I gain is worth 20% less, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he's still getting a relatively better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is still affecting the money's value, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 500, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy.

Considering the offers so far, I think I can do better than 4800. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the money's value, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to a 50/50 split, but this time it's a last chance for you to take it!""
}
```

I'm going back to the initial 50/50 split, but this time I'm framing it as a last chance, hoping to create a sense of urgency."
