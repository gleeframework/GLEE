"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $55 and Bob will get $45. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this division is fair, but I'm taking a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice, but let's be realistic. This time I get the slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less in this round, I'd rather try to get a better deal in the next round than accept an offer that gives Bob the larger share. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $52 for myself and $48 for Bob. My message suggests meeting in the middle, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for both of us. Hopefully, Bob will find this proposal acceptable."
