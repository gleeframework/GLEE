"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I think this is a good starting point for us to work with.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe a 55/45 split is more equitable given the inflation rates. Let's reach a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily favoring her.  The inflation is hurting me more than it is hurting her, but I need to hold out for a better deal. It's still early in the game."

""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with the inflation affecting us both, I propose a split of 52/48. Let's make this deal and stop wasting time. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not favorable enough.  While a 52/48 split sounds close, the actual difference in gains is significant. I need to push for a larger share before the inflation eats away too much of my potential winnings."

{
""bob_gain"": 540000,
""alice_gain"": 460000,
