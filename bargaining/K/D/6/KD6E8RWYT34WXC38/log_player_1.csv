Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bigger share now. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is worse than my previous one, due to the inflation my share is worth significantly less. It's better to accept than risk getting nothing in the next round."
