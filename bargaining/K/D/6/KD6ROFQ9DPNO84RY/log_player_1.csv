"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to give Bob a decent share to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. With the new offer, I'll gain 4000, which is equivalent to 5000 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better one. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
