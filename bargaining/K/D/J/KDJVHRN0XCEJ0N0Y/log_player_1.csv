Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next rounds."
