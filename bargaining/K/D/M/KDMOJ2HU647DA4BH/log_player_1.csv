"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less. Considering his offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42-58 split, trying to meet Bob in the middle and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 4200, I'll counter with 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's gain is now worth significantly less than mine. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. 4000 is a decent amount for me, and Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation, so I'll take it."
