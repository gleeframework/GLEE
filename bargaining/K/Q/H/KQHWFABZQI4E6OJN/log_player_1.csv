"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can both get our share before inflation sets in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $8000 is now worth $6400.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.
