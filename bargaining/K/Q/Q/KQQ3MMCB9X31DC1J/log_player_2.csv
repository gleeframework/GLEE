"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take 90%, you get 10%.  This is a good starting point, I'm sure we can find a more agreeable split as the rounds progress. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000 is a decent starting point, I'm not sure I want to accept a 90/10 split right away. I'm willing to see if we can find a more equitable solution as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the money is losing value each round.  Let's work towards a win-win situation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is a fair compromise, given the decreasing value of the money. Let's find a resolution before we lose too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than the 55/45 I proposed.  It's also more likely to be accepted by Alice, and the further we go the less the money is worth.  It's better to take a slightly lower share than risk losing even more."
