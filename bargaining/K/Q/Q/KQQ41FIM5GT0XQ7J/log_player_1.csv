"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still offers Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, he might be willing to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, this offer guarantees me a substantial amount of money. Considering that the money is worth less to Bob with each round, and my own earnings don't decrease, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action."
