Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust as we go.

# Bob gain: 50

{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand time is running out, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  This offer gives you a good amount while also considering my losses due to inflation. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is starting to make concessions.  I'm aiming to secure at least 60, and I think there's still room to negotiate before I have to consider a lower offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 62,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. This is the best I can do considering the inflation, and I believe it's still fair for both of us. Let's end this before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met my initial target offer. Accepting now guarantees a favorable outcome for me before inflation further erodes his share, potentially making him less willing to negotiate in later rounds."
