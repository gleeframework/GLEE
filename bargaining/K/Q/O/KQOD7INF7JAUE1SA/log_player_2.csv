Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 30$ for me, I'll try to do better than that. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less and less with each round. Alice's offer of 20$ for me is lower than my previous offer of 40$, and now it's even more attractive due to the reduced value of money. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it now or wait for a better offer. I'll play it safe and reject this offer.

Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, and it's getting more valuable for me to get a larger share now. I'll try to get a bigger share than my previous offer of 40$. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
