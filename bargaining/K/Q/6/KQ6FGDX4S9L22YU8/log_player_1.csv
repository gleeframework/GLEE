"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a good amount this way! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to get a bigger share now. However, Bob's offer is a fair one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
