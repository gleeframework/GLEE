"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept such an unfair offer.  I'll take my chances with inflation and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split. It's the fairest option, and I'm hoping that with the threat of inflation, Bob will see the value in reaching a compromise."
