"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and then we can re-evaluate the division in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm effectively getting a better deal than I would have if we were splitting it 50/50.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
