"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer is designed to get the game started. I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm giving Bob a small amount to encourage him to accept, as he loses money at a higher rate than me with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I can still do better by making my own proposal in the next round. Even though I lose money due to inflation, I lose it at a slower rate than Bob, so I have a better chance of securing a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly, but still keeping a substantial portion of the money. Bob is losing money faster than me, so I believe he'll accept this offer before it gets even less favorable for him."
