"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. My message to Bob is ""Let's start with a fair split"", hoping he'll accept this reasonable proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation affects us differently. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now to make up for the decreasing value of my money. I'll accept Bob's offer.
