"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal. This offer gets us both more than if we wait longer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains are decreasing rapidly. We need to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding rounds where the money is worth significantly less.
* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice's first offer suggests she might value fairness.  However, it heavily favored her. By offering slightly more than half, I acknowledge her desire for a decent share while emphasizing the time pressure.
* **Future Rounds:**  If Alice rejects this, I'm willing to be more flexible in the next round, as the decreasing value will make her initial offer more appealing to me anyway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money has decreased significantly. Accepting Alice's offer now gets me $4200, which is more than the $4000 she initially offered, even accounting for the two rounds of inflation.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. The longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to a more even split, demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
