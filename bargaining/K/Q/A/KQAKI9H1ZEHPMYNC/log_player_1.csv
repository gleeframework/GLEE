Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a fair offer given the circumstances, and I'm confident Bob will see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to take such a small share.  I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 80%, but I still believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of reaching a deal now before the inflation further reduces the value of the money."
