"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since the money is worth less""}

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money and offering a slightly better deal for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55 is still too much considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 62-38 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think the inflation is affecting the value of the money significantly, and 62 is a decent compromise. I'll take the deal and hope that Bob is satisfied with it too!"
