"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me a larger share but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still looking for a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing! 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good enough compromise, especially since I'm still losing value due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to make up for inflation""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 60-40 split, trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no more negotiations, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, as it's a fair compromise given the rapidly decreasing value of money. I'm not sure if I can do any better, and this way, we can finally end the negotiations."
