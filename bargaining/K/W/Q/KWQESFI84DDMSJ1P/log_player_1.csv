```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm taking a huge risk and going for a massive share, but I think the inflation has reduced the value of the money so much that it's almost worthless. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,

Round 13

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000000,

Round 15
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm not sure what's left to negotiate at this point. Considering the extreme inflation, my offer will be a repeat of my previous one. Here's my proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 0
}
```

I'm taking the entire amount, leaving Bob with nothing. I'm not expecting a different outcome this time around."
