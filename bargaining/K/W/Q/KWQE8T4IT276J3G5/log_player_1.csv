"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

I'm not thrilled about giving up more money, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
