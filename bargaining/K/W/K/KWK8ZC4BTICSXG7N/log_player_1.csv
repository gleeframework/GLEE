Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a seemingly unfair offer, hoping to secure the majority of the money before inflation kicks in.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though the money is worth less now due to inflation, I can still potentially get a better deal in the next round.  It's a risky strategy, but I'm willing to gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  I'm also taking into account that the inflation might make Bob more eager to accept a deal, even if it's not perfectly fair."
