Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 75/25 split. This offer gives you a fair share, and I get a little more to compensate for the inflation we'll face in the next few rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
