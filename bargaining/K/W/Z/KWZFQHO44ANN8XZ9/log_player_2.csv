Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as low as I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation working against me."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, 57-43 and we're done. Inflation is killing me! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough call, but the inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer guarantees me something and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
