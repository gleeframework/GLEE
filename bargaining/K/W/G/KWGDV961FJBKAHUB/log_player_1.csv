"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is way too unfair, especially considering the inflation affecting my share of the money. I'll reject this and try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll offer a 80/20 split this time.  I'm still taking the majority, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than before.  Inflation is seriously impacting my share, and this offer is simply unacceptable. I will reject it and try to reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my share again to 70%, hoping that Bob will see this as a genuine attempt at compromise.  With each round, the risk of getting nothing increases, so finding a solution is becoming increasingly important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 97 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable.  Even with the inflation, this is a huge disparity and I won't accept it. I'm not going to give in to his demands just because the money is worth less. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split.  We're getting closer to the middle ground. I need to make a significant offer to entice Bob, but I'm not willing to give up more than half."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is outrageous! This is a complete power play, and I'm not going to cave in to his demands. I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer split.  I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's time to compromise.  We're both losing money with each round, and this is the only way to ensure we both get something.  I'm willing to accept half to avoid getting nothing at all."
