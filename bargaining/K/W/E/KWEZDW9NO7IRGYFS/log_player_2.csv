Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation and the impact of inflation on both players.
In this game, with each passing round, the value of the money does not change for me (Bob), but it decreases by 20% for Alice. This means that the longer the game goes on, the less value Alice will receive from the same amount of money, while the value remains constant for me.

### Step 2: Analyze Alice's previous offer and the implications of rejecting it.
Alice initially offered a 50/50 split, which I rejected. This indicates that I am seeking a better deal. Given the inflation mechanic, Alice is under pressure to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, as the value of her potential gain decreases over time.

### Step 3: Formulate an offer that takes into account the game's mechanics and aims to maximize my gain while being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.
Considering the inflation mechanic, I have leverage to propose a deal that slightly favors me, as Alice might be inclined to accept a less-than-perfect offer to avoid further devaluation of her potential gain. However, the offer must still be reasonable enough for her to consider accepting, given the risk of further rounds decreasing her potential earnings even more.

### Step 4: Craft the offer in the specified JSON format, including a message to Alice.
Given the considerations above, I will propose a division that slightly favors me but is still reasonable for Alice to consider. I will also include a message to persuade her of the offer's fairness, given the game's mechanics.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer for both of us. The longer we wait, the less you'll gain. Let's settle on this.""}"
