"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI can try to get a better deal than 50/50. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to get more than half to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to get 55 dollars to compensate for the potential loss in value in the next rounds. Here is my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I want a bit more than half since the money loses value for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 48/52 to avoid further negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 9.75% less for me, I need to consider this when evaluating Alice's offer. Her offer of 52 for me is closer to what I was hoping for, but I'll calculate the effective value after inflation to decide.
### Effective value for me: 52 * 0.9025 (due to 9.75% less value) = 46.93
This is effectively less than what I offered Alice in the previous round. Given the decreasing value of money for me and the fact that we have more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer to try and get a better deal that compensates for the loss in value.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, I need to adjust my offer to ensure I get a fair deal. Since the money is now worth 9.75% less for me, I'll increase my requested amount to compensate for this loss. Here's my new offer:
{""bob_gain"": 58,
""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to give you 55, but I need at least 45 to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nLet's calculate the effective value of Alice's offer considering the inflation. The money is now worth 18.55% less for me.
### Effective value for me: 55 * 0.8145 (due to 18.55% less value) = 44.7975
Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, Alice's offer of 55, which effectively translates to approximately 44.80 for me, is not as appealing as it would have been in earlier rounds. However, considering we are halfway through the negotiation rounds and the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I need to weigh the pros and cons carefully.
At this point, getting something is better than risking getting nothing, especially since the value of the money continues to decrease for me with each round. It might be wise to accept this offer rather than hoping for a better deal in subsequent rounds, which may not materialize.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Alice's offer to ensure I get something out of this negotiation."
