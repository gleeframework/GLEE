6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly, Alice. I'm sure we can both agree that's fair.",Bob,2,
,,"I'm not sure splitting it evenly is fair, considering the inflation rate. If we split it evenly now, I'd be giving up more than 50% of my share in real terms. Can you do better?",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Considering the inflation rate, I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round. But I'll still take the lead, and you'll get a decent 45% of the money. It's a fair deal, don't you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, the inflation is starting to hurt. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than before, but I need at least 60% to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise.",Bob,4,
,,"I'm surprised you're willing to give me a smaller share now, but I'm not sure I want to give you 60% of the money. I think I can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at 55%?",Alice,4,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I should get the majority. I'll give you 58% of the money, and I'll take the rest. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation rate.",Alice,5,
