"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. I think this is a fair offer considering I get to propose first. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal isn't quite fair in my opinion, and I believe we can find a better split. Let's see what I can propose in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 55/45. I think this is a fairer offer considering we both have an equal chance of getting a good deal.""}\n\n###\nI've made my counteroffer to Alice, taking into account that the money's value will decrease over time. I've tried to find a balance between getting a good share and being reasonable, so Alice might accept it. Let's see what she decides!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer. Let's split 58/42 and call it a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer again. Although the money's value is decreasing, I believe we can still find a better split. Alice's offer is only slightly better than her initial one, and I'm not convinced it's the best we can do. Let's proceed to the next round and see what I can propose!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the money's value is decreasing, but I still believe we can find a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise and meet you closer to the middle. Let's split 52/48 and finalize the deal.""}\n\n###\nI've made another offer to Alice, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I've tried to find a middle ground that we can both agree on, while also considering the time pressure. Let's see how Alice responds!"
