Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'm willing to wait and see what Alice offers next round."

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

I'm still hoping for a more even split. I'll see what Alice offers next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's try again 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  While I would prefer a more even split, I'm accepting this offer to avoid losing money due to inflation."
