"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me due to inflation. It's in my best interest to settle quickly.
* **Fairness:** While I want to maximize my gain, I understand that an outrageously lopsided offer will likely be rejected by Bob.  
* **Opening Move:** This offer is slightly in my favor to account for the inflation disadvantage, but still reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a more balanced split. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. Accepting would mean losing a substantial amount of potential gain.
* **Leverage:**  Bob's rejection of my initial fair offer suggests he may be aiming for a larger share. However, he is not subject to inflation, meaning time is on my side. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to wait for a more reasonable proposal. This keeps the negotiation open and puts the pressure back on Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's not waste any more time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to settle this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Pressure:** Another round has passed, and the value of the money is decreasing for me. It's crucial to settle as quickly as possible.
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding my ground with a 50/50 split. This demonstrates that I'm serious about a fair deal and not willing to be lowballed.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the need for a swift resolution, implicitly reminding Bob of the time pressure working against me."
