This is a tough decision, but strategically it makes sense to accept. Here's why:

* **It's better than nothing:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Alice will propose an even worse deal in a later round, or the game might end with both of us getting nothing.
* **Alice is signaling finality:**  Her language suggests this is as good as it's going to get. Holding out for a slightly better deal might not be worth the risk. 

While I'd prefer a more even split, getting $400,000 is a significant sum."
