"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nSince this is the first round, I'll offer a division that is slightly in my favor but still reasonable for Bob to consider. Given the inflation rates, it's advantageous for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. My offer of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob reflects a balance between my desire to maximize my gain and the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, especially considering that the value of the money decreases more significantly for him with each passing round. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer, thereby ending the game quickly and avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the money will be worth less in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of money decreases with each round, accepting $450,000 in the second round, which is worth 10% less than in the first round, doesn't seem advantageous given the significant portion Bob has allocated to himself. Considering the inflation rates, it's crucial to negotiate a better split, especially since we are still in the early rounds. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that could be more favorable to me.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3. I will make a new offer to Bob. Here it is:
{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's be realistic""}\n\n###\n\nI've adjusted my offer slightly to reflect the urgency of reaching an agreement due to inflation, while still aiming to maximize my gain. The message ""Considering inflation, let's be realistic"" is intended to prompt Bob to think about the devaluing money and the benefits of accepting this offer rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to compromise. I'm willing to take a bit less, but I need to be compensated for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of money has decreased significantly for both of us, Bob's offer still allocates a larger share to himself. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on Bob's share, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more balanced split. Rejecting this offer allows me to make another proposal in the next round, aiming to find a compromise that better suits both parties.

{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Let's meet halfway considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've tried to find a middle ground, acknowledging the significant loss of value for Bob while ensuring I still receive a substantial share. The message ""Let's meet halfway considering the inflation impact"" is meant to convey my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement that considers the challenges posed by inflation."
