Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous here, Bob. This is my last offer.  We both know the money keeps shrinking. Time to decide. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Value:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Bob due to inflation. Waiting any longer means he'll be getting even less.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to hold out for a better offer isn't worth the risk. Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot, and she's unlikely to offer anything significantly better.
* **Something is better than nothing:** Accepting a smaller amount now is preferable to potentially ending up with nothing if Bob continues to reject offers and time runs out. 

While $200,000 is significantly less than what Bob aimed for initially, it's the most rational decision considering the circumstances and the rapidly decreasing value of the reward.
