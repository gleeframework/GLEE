"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping Bob will be greedy and accept this, as it's unlikely he'll get a better offer in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, this is a significant improvement from the first round. Accepting this ensures I get at least a large portion of the money, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future."
