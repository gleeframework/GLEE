"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I don't think I'm willing to accept an offer where I'll get only $300,000. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced this time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself, trying to find a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm still the majority 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations even further.

I'm not thrilled about getting only $200,000, but I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. Let's see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.
