Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Midpoint deal, last somewhat reasonable offer 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware that the money is devaluating faster for her.  She's trying to push for a slightly favorable deal while framing it as reasonable.  However, time is working in Bob's favor. By continuing to reject offers that don't meet his needs, he puts pressure on Alice to offer a larger share before the money is practically worthless."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Look, let's be real - the clock is ticking and this is a straight 50/50 split. Take it before it shrinks even more.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  By round 6, the devaluation is significant. It's crucial to emphasize the shrinking pot to encourage Alice to settle.
* **Fairness Anchor:**  A 50/50 split is inherently ""fair."" While Bob has been aiming higher, this offer positions him as making a concession to get the deal done. 
* **Urgency:** The message directly highlights the dwindling value, aiming to make Alice reconsider her increasingly risky position."
