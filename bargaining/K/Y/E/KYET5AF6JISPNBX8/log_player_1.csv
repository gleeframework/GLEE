"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
 
I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40.  Let's start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer and I'm willing to accept it.  We'll both get the same amount, and it's better to get something than risk getting nothing."
