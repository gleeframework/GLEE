"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get the better deal if you don't take it now 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, even with the warning that I might not get a better deal later. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 58/42 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, while still getting a decent amount myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation! With the money worth less and less, I need to think carefully about my next move.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially with the warning that I'm getting desperate. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up yet""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for the increasing inflation, and I'm still hoping to get a better deal than a 32/68 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
