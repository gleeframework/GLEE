"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is a fairly standard opening offer, giving Bob a small share to make the proposal seem fair. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation rate is significant and my gain is already reduced by 5%. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial share, and any further rounds risk losing even more due to inflation."
