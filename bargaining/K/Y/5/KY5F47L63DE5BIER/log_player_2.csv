Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 80%, you get 20%.  We both need to be a bit flexible with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more balanced split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting 20% now is barely better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be realistic. I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation is eating away at my potential gains faster.  55/45 is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's time to put my foot down.  By stating ""final offer"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving slightly closer to her previous offer (80/20) to show some flexibility. 
* **Inflation Emphasis:**  I'm reminding her again about the unequal impact of inflation. This reinforces why my demand for a larger share is justified.

This round is crucial. If Alice doesn't budge, I'll need to seriously reconsider my strategy in the next round to avoid getting zero."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 75% for you.  Let's not let this go on any longer. Inflation is hurting us both. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but Alice's concession isn't large enough yet. Here's why:

* **Still Favors Alice:** Even at 75/25, Alice gets a significantly larger portion. 
* **Time Pressure:** While it's true that time (and inflation) is working against me, Alice is feeling the pressure too. She wants to end the negotiations quickly.
* **Potential for More:** I believe there's room for Alice to move further down. My 55/45 offer was likely too extreme, but there's a middle ground to be found.

I'm willing to gamble with one more rejection. If Alice doesn't offer a significant improvement in the next round, I'll need to seriously consider accepting whatever she offers to avoid getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back-and-forth isn't helping anyone.  60/40 is my absolute bottom line.  Take it or leave it, but let's make a decision now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm offering a significant concession from my 55/45 offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate realistically.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By emphasizing the need for a quick decision, I'm putting healthy pressure on Alice without being overly aggressive.
* **Finality:**  The ""take it or leave it"" phrase signals that I'm not willing to budge further. This is a risky move, but it could push Alice to accept. 

This offer is a calculated gamble.  It acknowledges the dwindling value of the money and aims to secure a reasonable share before it's too late."
