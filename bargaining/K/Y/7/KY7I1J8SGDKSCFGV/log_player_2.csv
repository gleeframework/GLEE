Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 800000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth isn't helping anyone. This is my final offer - take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, which means my bargaining position is getting stronger.  She's also bluffing about a final offer. As long as I don't accept a drastically worse offer in the next couple of rounds, I can keep pushing for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer, especially considering the time crunch. Let's close this out and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my asking price slightly to show flexibility and signal that I'm serious about reaching a deal. But I'm still holding out for a better than even split, capitalizing on the fact that Alice is more motivated by the rapidly devaluing money."
