"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 85/15 split in my favor. This way, I'll have a significant portion of the money now, but the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds won't affect my gain as much. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
