"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and 70-30 is still quite lopsided in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think 55-45 is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob getting 45%, which is $45. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now 
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer again. The split is still quite lopsided, and I'm not convinced that 62-38 is a fair compromise. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for an even more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's try to split it 50/50, it's the fairest way""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to this offer and we can end the game."
