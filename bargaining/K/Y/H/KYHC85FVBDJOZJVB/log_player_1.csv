# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast!

Considering the reduced value of the money Bob gains, this offer is still a bit more favorable to Bob. However, I'll consider it a fair compromise, given the circumstances.
