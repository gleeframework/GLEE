"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I think this is a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to delay and try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering her a smaller share. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer leaves us both with something substantial while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Since the money is worth even less for Alice in this round (36% less than the first round), I believe I can get an even better deal if I wait. The fact that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round gives me an advantage in negotiations. Let's see what Alice comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I think this is a generous offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my proposed share again, considering the decreasing value of the money for Alice. Since my gain remains unaffected by inflation, I have a strong bargaining position. I'm trying to push Alice to accept a less favorable deal, but still offering her a substantial amount to avoid her walking away. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although Alice is offering a 50/50 split, the fact that her share is worth 59.04% less than in the first round means that she's actually getting a much worse deal than I am. Since my gain remains unaffected by inflation, I have a significant advantage in the negotiations. I'll try to push for an even better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Considering the extreme impact of inflation on your share, I think this is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my proposed share again, taking into account the significant decrease in value of Alice's share due to inflation. Since my gain remains unaffected, I'm trying to maximize my advantage in the negotiations. I'm offering Alice a smaller share, but still giving her something to avoid her walking away. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're trying to take advantage of the situation. This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering Alice's message that this is her final offer, and the fact that she's willing to walk away with nothing if I reject it, I'll accept this offer. Although I was trying to maximize my gain, the risk of losing everything is too high. With this offer, I still get a larger share, and considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. It's better to secure a gain of 55 than to risk losing everything."
