Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We both know inflation is biting, but we can still come to an agreement.  I'm willing to split it 60/40, with me taking slightly more since I'm the one making the offer.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
