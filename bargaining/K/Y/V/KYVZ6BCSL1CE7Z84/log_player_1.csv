"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more for being the proposer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since Bob is the proposer, I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous counteroffer."
