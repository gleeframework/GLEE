"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures fairness for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more for the risk of waiting.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, but I'm keeping $550,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
