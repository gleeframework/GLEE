"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll offer 70-30. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept this offer. I was hoping for a better split, and now that the money is worth 20% less, I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous on your side, I'll offer 55-45""

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're moving closer to my side, but I'll give you a bit more. Will 80-20 work? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! I don't think I'll accept this offer. The 80-20 split is still quite lopsided, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
