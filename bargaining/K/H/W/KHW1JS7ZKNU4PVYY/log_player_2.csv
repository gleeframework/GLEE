"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99.9% and leave you 0.1% this time. Fair enough, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it seems tempting to take a small amount now, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the only way to ensure we both get something decent, considering inflation is hurting me with every round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally coming around.  A 50/50 split is a good deal for me at this point, especially since she's feeling the pressure of the inflation. It's better to secure a fair amount now than risk getting even less later."
