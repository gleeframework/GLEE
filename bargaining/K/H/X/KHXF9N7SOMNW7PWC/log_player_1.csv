"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer is fair and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is not satisfied. It gives me a slightly larger share, which is reasonable considering the risk of inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  The inflation penalty is already in effect, and if I reject this offer, the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round is high.  It's better to secure a reasonable gain now than risk getting nothing."
