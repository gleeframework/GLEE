"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to potentially get a more favorable division. Plus, the inflation rate affects Alice more than me, so I have a bit of leverage there. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. Given the inflation rates, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is shrinking.  This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money's value is decreasing, Alice's proposal still doesn't seem balanced enough for me to accept, especially considering the greater impact of inflation on her share. I'll hold out for a better deal, hoping the pressure of further inflation and the risk of ending up with nothing will prompt a more favorable offer from Alice in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I believe this is a reasonable adjustment. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth, and this split reflects that.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a good compromise. Take it before inflation eats away at the value even more! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although the pressure of time and inflation is mounting, Alice's proposal still doesn't meet my expectations for a fair split. Given the significantly higher impact of inflation on her share, I believe she has more to lose by not reaching an agreement soon. I'll push for a better deal, considering the diminishing value of the money and the risk of losing everything if we don't agree within the remaining rounds. The difference in inflation impact between us gives me a stronger negotiating position, which I'll try to leverage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think this offer is more than fair. We're running out of time, and it's crucial we reach an agreement soon. This split reflects the urgency and the differing effects of inflation on our shares.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Any more rounds and inflation will hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nFinally, a 50/50 split is on the table. Given the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, especially on Alice's, I believe accepting this offer is the wisest decision. Further rounds will only continue to devalue the money, and the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds is too high. A 50/50 split at this point is indeed the fairest option, considering the circumstances. It's time to end the negotiations and secure what's left of the value."
