"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm looking to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly way of saying that I'm willing to be generous, but I'm also looking to get the better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no hard feelings! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

I'll consider Bob's offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to try to get a bit more, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 64% of its original value ($5,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $3,200), and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 90.25% of its original value ($5,000 x 0.95 x 0.95 = $4,512.50).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value ($6,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $3,072), and Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth 94.75% of its original value ($6,000 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 = $5,513.75).

I'll consider Bob's offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, this seems like a fair compromise, and I'd rather settle now than risk losing more value in future rounds."
