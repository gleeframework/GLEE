"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky this time, but I'll take a bigger cut next round! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of the original value, which is $285,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of the original value, which is $630,000.

I don't like the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but don't get too comfortable!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain some balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it! Time to take the last crumbs. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My gain of $150,000 is worth 85.74% of the original value, which is $85,110. And Bob's gain of $850,000 is worth 73% of the original value, which is $740,500.

I don't like the uneven split, and the fact that Bob is getting a much larger share. I'll have to think carefully about this one...
