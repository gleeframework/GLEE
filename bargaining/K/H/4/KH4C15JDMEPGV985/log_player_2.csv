"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  Hope you'll agree!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable - I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll counter your offer. I'm willing to give you 30%, but I need at least 70%. This is my final offer, if you reject it, you'll get nothing in the next round due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice is playing tough, and while the offer isn't ideal, it's better to take something now. If I reject this offer, the next round will be even worse due to inflation eating into my potential gains.
