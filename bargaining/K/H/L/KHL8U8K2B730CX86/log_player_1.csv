"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A good start, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is getting less valuable by the minute!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up a significant amount of money. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with a lower amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
