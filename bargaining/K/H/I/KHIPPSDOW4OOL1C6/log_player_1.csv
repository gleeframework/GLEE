"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll think carefully about this offer... I'd rather not accept a smaller share than I initially proposed, but I don't want to risk Bob making an even worse offer in the next round.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation, the money is worth 60% of its original value now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm keeping a larger share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant amount to try to keep the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money now!

I'm not thrilled about accepting a smaller share than I initially proposed, but I think this offer is a good compromise. I'd rather accept a smaller share now and get some money than risk Bob making an even worse offer in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
