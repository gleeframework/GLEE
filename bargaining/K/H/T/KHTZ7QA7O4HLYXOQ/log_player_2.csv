Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

While I could push for a slightly better outcome in the remaining rounds, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** With each round, Alice's share is worth less to her due to inflation. This means she's increasingly likely to accept a less favorable deal as time runs out. However, this also increases the risk of her making a desperate last-minute offer that would leave me with nothing if I rejected it.
* **Guaranteed payout:** Accepting now guarantees me a substantial sum of $500,000.  Rejecting this offer risks ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and while I was aiming for a higher share initially,  the time pressure makes this a reasonable compromise."
