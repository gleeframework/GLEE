"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent amount to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is a generous offer for the first round, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal later on. The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I'm going to see if I can leverage that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a more even split, keeping in mind the inflation will affect us both differently.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair share considering the inflation.  Let's try this split. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is offering a decent amount, the inflation is starting to bite, and I think I can still get a better deal. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Let's try to find a more equitable split. The inflation is impacting both of us, so let's aim for something closer to 50/50. This offer still gives you a significant share, but it's a fairer distribution.""
