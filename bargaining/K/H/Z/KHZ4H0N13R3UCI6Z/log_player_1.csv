"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to maximize my share while still being reasonable enough to hopefully avoid a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable than my first offer.  However, I'm not willing to settle for exactly half yet.  I'll see if I can get a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share than his last offer, but still more than half.  I'm hoping to get a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation on Bob's side. While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, this offer is close enough to my desired split and I don't want to risk losing more money in future rounds."
