"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer above 50.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your last offer above 50, so I'm trying a bit lower 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is ticking, accepting an offer significantly below 50% is a bad strategy.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she becomes more agreeable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is it. A perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing hardball and knows the inflation is hurting me.  Offering anything less than a 50/50 split at this point is likely to end in her favor.  This offer shows I'm serious about getting a fair deal and puts the pressure on her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know you're losing value, but I'm not budging much 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one. The inflation is stinging, and Alice is being stubborn. However, accepting 44% when we were so close to a 50/50 split sets a bad precedent. There's a real risk Alice will push even lower in the next round. I need to show some backbone and hope she starts to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice.  I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be a fair deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to show some flexibility, but not too much. Offering 48% is a strategic move. It acknowledges the time pressure and inflation but also sets a clear boundary. Alice is pushing her luck, and this offer might be enough to get her to settle before we both lose out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not moving much, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough pill to swallow, but with time running out and inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to be realistic. Accepting 45% is far from ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing if Alice continues to play hardball. The risk of losing everything now outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal in the few remaining rounds."
