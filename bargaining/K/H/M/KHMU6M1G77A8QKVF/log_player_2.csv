"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth considering the inflation risk and potential for a better deal.  Rejecting allows Bob to propose next and potentially secure a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While inflation is a factor, I believe this is a fair starting point that allows us both to gain a significant portion of the money."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to compromise but still think I should get the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, inflation is becoming a serious issue.  Accepting this offer secures a decent gain for me, and further rounds risk losing a significant amount of value due to the escalating inflation."
