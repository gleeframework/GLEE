"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering we're starting with a large sum of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, but I'll consider his proposal. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about the value of the 400,000 I'd get.

After some thought, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting 550,000 and Bob getting 450,000. I'm trying to be more generous than before, but I'm still looking out for my own interests."
