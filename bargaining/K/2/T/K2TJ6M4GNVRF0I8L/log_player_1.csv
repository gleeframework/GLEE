"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. I'm keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bit more, I'm feeling lucky! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth $70 * 0.95 = $66.5.

I don't think I like this offer. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Split it down the middle, no need to fight""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
