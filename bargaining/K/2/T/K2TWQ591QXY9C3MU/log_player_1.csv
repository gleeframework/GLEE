"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Still a good deal, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to get a decent share too. Let's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the compromise. $4,500 is a decent amount for me, and Bob gets a larger share than before. It's a reasonable deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round."
