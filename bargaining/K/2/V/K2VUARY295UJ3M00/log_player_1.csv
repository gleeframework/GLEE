Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a repeat of your first offer, which was already tilted in your favor. Let's end this here before we both lose out more. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000

This is a tough one, but it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this goes on, the less money we're both getting. Accepting now still gets me more than my initial offer.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  Bob seems stuck on this 60/40 split. He might not budge further, and waiting another round risks an even worse offer."
