"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to keep the majority of the money, as there is no inflation yet, and I want to maximize my gains in the first round. I figure Bob will likely accept, as he's getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth the same for me as in the first round, Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. I still believe I have a better chance of getting a more favorable outcome if we continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 90 for myself and 10 for Bob.  While I still want the majority, I need to be mindful that Bob's offer was very unfavorable, and continuing to be too greedy could lead to a worse outcome for me in the future. I'm hoping this more balanced offer will encourage him to accept, ending the game favorably for both of us."
