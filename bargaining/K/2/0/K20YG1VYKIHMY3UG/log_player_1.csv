Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the inflation difference. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'm not accepting this offer because I believe the 65-35 split is still not in my favor, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. 55-45 seems fair.""}\n\n### I've taken into account the impact of inflation on both our gains and decided to propose a slightly more even split, while still considering my own interests. Let's see how Bob responds!"
