"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to counter! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully. With the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me less than half of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not falling for it!""
}
```

I'm trying to take into account the inflation effect and offer a slightly higher amount to me, while still keeping the total at 10,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're clever, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is not giving up easily!

Considering the significant inflation effect this round, I'll have to be cautious. With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me a relatively small amount.

However, I don't want to reject this offer without considering the bigger picture. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a strategic move that will lead to a better outcome in the long run."
