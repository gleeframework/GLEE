"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have the smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept the smaller share. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 30-70, can we try again?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more even split!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 split?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50-50 split, but still gives me a slightly larger share."
