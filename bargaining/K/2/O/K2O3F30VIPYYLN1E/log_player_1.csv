"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll receive:
My gain: 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000
Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.
