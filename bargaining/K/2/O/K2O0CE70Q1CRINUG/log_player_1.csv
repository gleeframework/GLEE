"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 6000 and Bob takes 4000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was willing to compromise in the first round, and I think 6000 is a fair starting point. Bob's offer of 3000 for me is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'd like to make a new offer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I take 4500 and Bob takes 5500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really not happy with Bob's offer. I'm already getting a bad deal due to inflation, and his offer of 2000 for me is extremely low. I think I deserve more, especially considering I'm getting a worse deal due to inflation. I'm not willing to accept this offer and will try to make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's the fairest way""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where I take 5000 and Bob takes 5000. I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise, considering the effects of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
