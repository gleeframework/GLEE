"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, with a slight advantage for me to start the negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept the even split, considering the inflation is reducing the value of the money with each passing round. It's better to settle now than risk further devaluation."
