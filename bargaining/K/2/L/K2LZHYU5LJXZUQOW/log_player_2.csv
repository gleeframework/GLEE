# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is eroding your share rapidly.  This is a chance to secure a decent amount. Don't let greed lead to nothing.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing a bit more aggressively now, offering Alice slightly less than half.  The message emphasizes the time pressure and the shrinking value of her potential gains. This hopefully pushes her to accept before the deal gets even worse for her."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know I'm taking a hit from inflation, but I'm not ready to give up yet. 53-47 is my new compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but she's still overestimating her position.  With each round, the deal is getting significantly better for me.  I'll hold out for at least 50/50, if not better."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is more than generous considering the circumstances. Take it before it's too late.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The tide has turned. I'm now demanding more than half, reflecting the reality of the shrinking pot for Alice. The message reinforces the urgency and emphasizes the favorable nature of the offer for her, given the circumstances. This could be the tipping point where she realizes accepting a less favorable deal is better than risking nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end. I'll meet you halfway, 50-50, to get something rather than nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the reality of the situation. While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next round or two, there's a significant risk that Alice's pride might lead to both of us getting nothing. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point, and it guarantees a win rather than risking a complete loss."
