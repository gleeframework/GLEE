"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 40$ in real terms. I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations.
