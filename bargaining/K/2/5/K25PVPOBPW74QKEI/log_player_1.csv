Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going to offer the same split as before, as it seems Bob may be valuing a larger portion than previously. Even with the inflation effect, this offer remains beneficial to me, and I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before the value of his share decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 89 
# Bob gain: 11 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my initial offer, and given the inflation, accepting this offer is the most rational choice for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that the next round will result in a much lower share for me."
