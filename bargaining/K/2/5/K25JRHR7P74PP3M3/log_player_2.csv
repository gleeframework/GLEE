Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know inflation is a factor.  I want to see if I can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm going to flip the script on you this round, Alice. Let's see if you're willing to be more flexible.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's find a compromise! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd like to continue negotiating, the inflation is starting to take a bite out of my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's still a decent split considering the circumstances."
