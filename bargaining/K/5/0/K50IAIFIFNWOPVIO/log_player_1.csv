Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! How about we reverse it?  I'll take $60, and you get $40. It's still a decent amount before inflation eats away at it too much. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
