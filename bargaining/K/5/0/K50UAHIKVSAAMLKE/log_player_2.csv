"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal. The 40-60 split doesn't seem quite fair to me, considering the money loses more value for Alice over time. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hits you harder, I think this split is more reasonable. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and end this before we both lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a fair offer, considering the money is losing value for both of us. Splitting it evenly seems reasonable at this point, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. Let's end the game here."
