"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's move towards a more balanced distribution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation accordingly. 

My gain of $45 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $36 in the first round. Bob's gain of $55 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $44 in the first round.

Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I initially proposed, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (80% of 80%), I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""Time to take the lead""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 this time.  It's getting late, and I'd rather not keep going back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value due to inflation (100% - 48.8%), I need to adjust my calculation. Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is equivalent to a 60% gain of $51.2, and a 40% gain of $34.6.

Considering the inflation and the fact that I'm getting closer to the last round, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept it.
