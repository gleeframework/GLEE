"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject this offer. My gain of 400,000 is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of 600,000 is now worth 20% less than in the first round. This is a less favorable deal for me, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn again. Considering the previous offers, I'll try to make a more advantageous proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a comeback!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 450,000 is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 51.2% of the original amount (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%), which is 0.512 * 600,000 = 307,200.

This offer is actually a good one for me, as my gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth less than in the previous round. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
