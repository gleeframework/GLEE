"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the initial $100. I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual value of the $40 I'd get: $40 / (1 - 0.05) = $42.

Similarly, the $60 Bob would get is worth 20% less than in the first round, so it's actually worth $48.

Considering these values, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
