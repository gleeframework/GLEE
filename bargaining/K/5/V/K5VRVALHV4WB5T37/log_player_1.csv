"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my $6,000 gain in the first round is now worth $4,800 in real value.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, considering I'm getting less than I initially offered. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the 40% inflation (20% from the first round and 20% from the second round), my gain is worth 64% of its original value. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3840,
  ""bob_gain"": 6160
}
```"
