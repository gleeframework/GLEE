"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's a significant advantage for me.  However, I'm aware of the inflation, so I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. Given the inflation, my share will be worth less in the next round, and there's no guarantee Bob will make a more favorable offer.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
