Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}

# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $7,000 (10% less than $8,000)
Bob's gain: $2,850 (5% less than $3,000)

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet. Your turn to think again! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: $6,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $4,362
Bob's gain: $8,000 * 0.857 (1 - 0.143) = $6,856

Considering the actual values, Bob's offer is:
Alice's gain: $4,500
Bob's gain: $5,500

I'll reject this offer, as I was expecting a better deal considering the actual values.
