"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it's a significant amount for Bob and leaves me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob is offering me a larger share than I offered him, it's still significantly less than what I initially proposed.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to raise my offer slightly,  giving Bob $200,000. This should be appealing to him after rejecting my previous offer, and still leaves me with the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not getting the majority, I've lost a significant amount in each round.  This offer ensures I receive at least something, and Bob will have the majority. It's time to end this game."
