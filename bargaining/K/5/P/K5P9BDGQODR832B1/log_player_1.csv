"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40 dollars and keep 60 dollars for myself. I think this is a reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of money in each round. Let's see if Bob accepts it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the value of money is decreasing, I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Bob's offer is not good enough for me, considering I offered him 40 dollars in the first round and now he's offering me 45 dollars, which is worth 5% less than in the first round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob 43 dollars and keep 57 dollars for myself. Since the value of money is decreasing, I'm willing to offer Bob a bit more than my initial offer, but I still want to get the most out of the deal. Let's see if Bob accepts it!"
