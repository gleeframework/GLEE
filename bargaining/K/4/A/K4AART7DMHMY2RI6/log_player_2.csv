"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, Bob. But a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. I'm willing to compromise and offer a 55/45 split.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
