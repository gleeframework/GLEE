"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I think I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more cautious.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
