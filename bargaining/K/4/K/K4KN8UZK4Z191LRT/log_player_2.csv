Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should take this, the inflation is only going to get worse for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is eating into my potential gains, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% is a losing strategy.  I need to show Alice I'm willing to walk away, otherwise, she'll keep lowballing me as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, I'm willing to compromise a little.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the pressure is on.  I need to sweeten the deal a little to avoid walking away with nothing. 
* **Calculated Risk:** Offering 48% is still better than any offer Alice has made so far.  There's a chance she'll take it due to the time pressure and the fact that I'm signaling this is my final offer. 
* **Inflation Factor:** While the inflation is a factor, I need to balance it against the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
