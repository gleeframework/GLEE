Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 57-43, it's a bit more than my initial offer, but I think it's fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know it's getting ridiculous, but I'm not budging much. My new offer is 58-42. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains.  While 42 isn't great, rejecting this offer means gambling on getting anything at all in the next round. Alice seems firm in her position, and the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me."
