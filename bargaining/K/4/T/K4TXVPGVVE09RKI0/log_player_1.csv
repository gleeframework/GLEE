Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice, and this money is losing value fast!  A 45/55 split seems fair at this point. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. Here's why I decided to accept:

* **Inflation:** Bob is right, the money is losing value for him rapidly. While my purchasing power remains the same, his is diminishing. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds.
* **Shift in Power:** Bob's offer has shifted closer to a more even split.  This shows he understands the pressure of the inflation and is becoming more willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is risky. Bob might get desperate and offer even less, or we might not reach an agreement at all. Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable share."
