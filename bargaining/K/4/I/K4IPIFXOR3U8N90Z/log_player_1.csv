"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a slight advantage this round, Alice.  Let's see how you feel about this split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about giving Bob a 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not accepting, the game will proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You took a 20% advantage last round, now it's my turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, trying to balance out the advantage Bob had in the previous round."
