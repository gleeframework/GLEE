"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a generous but not overly generous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. Although I get less than I proposed in the first round, it's still a significant amount of money. It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation with the increasing inflation."
