"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamics will favor Bob in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still significantly skewed in his favor. I'll reject and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to 5200 for me and 4800 for Bob.  This offer is more balanced, considering the inflation that has occurred. I believe it's a fair compromise and a good chance for us both to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has heavily impacted the value of the money I gain, Bob's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split.  Accepting this offer is the most beneficial option given the current circumstances."
