"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal than 40/60!  I'll see if I can get Alice to budge a little."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation will affect your share more than mine.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your previous offer was too much. I propose a 55/45 split - it's a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a 60/40 split, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation. Let's take the 55/45 split and end this game."
