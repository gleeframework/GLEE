"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids any immediate risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is taking a bigger share, it's not a significant enough gain for him to risk losing more in the next round due to inflation. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself. I'm willing to give up some of the potential gain to incentivize Bob to accept, as it's in both of our interests to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a better split, the inflation is becoming a serious concern. Accepting this offer means I secure some value, which is better than risking further losses. It's a calculated risk, but I need to prioritize what's best for my current financial situation."
