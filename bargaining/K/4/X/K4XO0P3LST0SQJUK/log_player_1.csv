"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a 60-40 split, especially since I was initially offered a 50-50 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). So, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

In this round, my gain of $4800 is worth 48.8% of what it was in the first round, which is $4800 * 0.488 = $2344.80.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled with the idea of getting less than half of the remaining amount. However, I'm not sure if I want to risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
