Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said the money is evaporating for you, so I'll take a bit more while it's still worth the same for me 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **The Trend:** Alice is clearly aiming to take advantage of the inflation and my desperation. Each round, my potential gain decreases significantly.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. She might even offer less!
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While $40 is much less than I wanted initially, it's still better than walking away with nothing if the game continues and the offers get worse."
