"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the ratio, and I think I can do better."
