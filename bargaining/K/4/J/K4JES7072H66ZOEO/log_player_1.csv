"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message to Bob is to accept and end the game, but I suspect he might not be too happy with this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I think this is fair and avoids further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would get from Bob's offer is 5000 * 0.9 = 4500.

I'd rather wait for a better offer, so I'll reject Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 90% of the previous round's value, which is 4500 * 0.9 = 4050. To make my offer more attractive, I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A compromise: I'll give you a larger share, but I still need more for myself.""
}
```"
