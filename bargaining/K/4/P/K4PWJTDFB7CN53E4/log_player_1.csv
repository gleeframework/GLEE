Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's try 70/30.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think 65/35 is the most I can do. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the money is worth significantly less to me now, I have no guarantee I'll get anything in the next round.  Accepting 350,000 is better than risking getting nothing."
