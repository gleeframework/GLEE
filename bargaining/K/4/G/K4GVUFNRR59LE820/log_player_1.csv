Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair division, taking into account the inflation that will affect our future gains.  Let's be reasonable and split the money with a slight advantage to me, since I am the one making the offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
