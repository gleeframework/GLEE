Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's end this and both of us can get something. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get.  The value of the money is declining rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
