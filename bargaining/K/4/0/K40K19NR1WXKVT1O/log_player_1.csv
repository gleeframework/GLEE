"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he'll accept it in the first round.  Since he loses 20% of the value with each round, he might be tempted to take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While I'm getting a much smaller share than I wanted, my money is worth significantly less with each round.  If I reject this offer, I'll get even less in the next round, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything at all."
