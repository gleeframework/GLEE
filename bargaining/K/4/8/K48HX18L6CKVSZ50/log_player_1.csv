"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a risky move, but I'm betting on Bob being reasonable and accepting the offer. After all, 1 dollar is better than nothing. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a tough one. While 1000 dollars is tempting, it's worth significantly less than it was in the previous round due to inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that this isn't a sustainable offer and will adjust his strategy in the next round.  I'll continue to be cautious and hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, recognizing the need to be more cooperative. While I'm still prioritizing my own gain, I'm willing to give Bob a larger share to hopefully avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation diminishing my gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than his previous offer. Despite the inflation, I'm not willing to settle for a paltry 100,000 dollars. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the futility of his strategy and make a more reasonable offer in the next round. I'm still confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going for a more balanced offer again, hoping to strike a compromise with Bob.  Inflation is becoming a serious factor, but I'm still aiming for a substantial share. If this fails, I might need to consider a more drastic strategy in the next round."
