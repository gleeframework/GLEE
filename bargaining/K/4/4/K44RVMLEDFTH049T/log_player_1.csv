"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's reach an agreement before inflation eats away too much of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but waiting longer hurts us both. This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and close the deal now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** It's round 3, meaning another round means Alice's potential gains shrink again.  She needs to apply pressure now.
* **Shifting Blame:** By calling it her ""final offer,"" she implies any further rejection is Bob being unreasonable, not her being greedy.
* **Slight Concession:** 55/45 is better than her original 60/40, showing *some* willingness to compromise, but not much.
* **Unequal Inflation:**  Bob doesn't feel the time pressure Alice does. Highlighting the mutual loss (""hurts us both"") is an attempt to appeal to his rational side.

This is a risky strategy, as it could backfire if Bob is stubborn. But with each round, Alice loses more ground, so a bold move is needed."
