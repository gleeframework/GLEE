"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money 75/25. This offers you a slightly larger share while still providing a significant portion for me. Let me know if you agree.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking 60 and you taking 40. This is a fair compromise considering we both lose value with each passing round. Let's reach an agreement before the money depreciates further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
