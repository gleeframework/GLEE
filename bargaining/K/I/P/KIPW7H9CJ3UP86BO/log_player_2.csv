```
Let's break down why this offer makes sense for Bob:

* **Leveraging Inflation:** Bob knows the value of the money decreases faster for him (20% per round) than for Alice (10% per round). Delaying benefits him less than it benefits Alice. 
* **Stronger Position:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals he's willing to play strategically. He now gets to make an offer from a stronger position.
* **Fairness & Incentive:** While the offer is tilted in Bob's favor, it's still reasonable enough for Alice to consider. Accepting gives Alice an immediate payout, while rejecting means risking a worse offer in the next round (with less overall value)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split, recognizing the impact of inflation. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees Bob a reasonable share before inflation further erodes the value from his perspective.  

Here's why it's a good decision *now*:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Waiting longer means the total value of the $100 decreases significantly for Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer in the hopes of getting a slightly better deal in a later round is too risky. The potential gain is outweighed by the potential loss from further inflation. 
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice's offer, and her message, suggest she's unlikely to move much further in Bob's favor."
