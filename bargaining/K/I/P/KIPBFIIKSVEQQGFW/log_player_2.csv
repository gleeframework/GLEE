"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. What do you say?

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite greedy. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop to 55% for you, Bob.  This seems like a more reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant sum due to inflation. We need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I'm proposing 65/35. It's more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation working against me.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With each round, the value of the money decreases for Bob. We need to push for a favorable deal quickly.
* **Compromise:**  While still favoring Bob, this offer is a significant move towards the middle ground from his previous 70/30 proposal. 
* **Pressure:** Reminding Alice about the inflation keeps the pressure on her to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
