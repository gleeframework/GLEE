""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I propose we split the money with me taking $550,000 and you taking $450,000. This is a fair starting point as it gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation factor for me.  What do you say?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your advantage with the inflation, but I believe a more even split is fairer, with me taking a slight advantage to reflect the upcoming rounds.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
