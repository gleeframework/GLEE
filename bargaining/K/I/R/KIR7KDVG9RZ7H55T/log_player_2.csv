Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close!  I'm acknowledging the time pressure with this offer. Let's settle this before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that inflation hurts me more than her.  I need to hold firm for a better deal. While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, waiting one more round might push Alice into a more reasonable position."

{
""bob_gain"": 480000,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this one.  I'm offering you a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Let's be realistic and end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point.  The longer this drags on, the more I lose due to the higher inflation rate working against me.  Taking the 400,000 now is better than risking getting even less in the later rounds or even ending up with nothing."
