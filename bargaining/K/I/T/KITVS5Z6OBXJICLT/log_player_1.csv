"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total. I'll get $800,000, which is 80% of the total. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a good amount that way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'd like to reject it. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer and had to take the risk of being rejected.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and another 10% less than in the second round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You rejected my first offer, so I'm taking a slightly tougher stance this time. Let's see if you'll accept this one!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need to make sure I get a fair amount too. Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I should accept it. The 60-40 split is still better than what I had initially, and I'm not sure if I can do any better in future rounds.
