"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair proposal.  I want to keep the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Since this is the first round, I'm not as worried about the inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer, and the inflation makes it even less appealing.  I'm going to reject it and hope for a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a more even split this time.  Inflation is starting to bite, and I need to be more reasonable if I want to avoid getting a worse deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, especially considering the inflation. I'm hoping for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than my previous offer, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  The inflation is becoming a serious issue, and I need to secure a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, even with the significant inflation. I am determined to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping to finally reach an agreement.  Inflation is getting out of control, and I need to find a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation has made it too risky to continue rejecting offers. I need to secure some of the money before it loses more value."
