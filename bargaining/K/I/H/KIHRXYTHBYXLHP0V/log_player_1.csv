"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's be a little more even this time. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. Bob is offering me 49% of the current value, which is equivalent to 54% of the initial value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
