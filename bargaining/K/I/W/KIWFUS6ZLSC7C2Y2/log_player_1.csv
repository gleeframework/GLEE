"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round, he might find it worthwhile to accept even such a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's a fair deal.  While I could potentially get a slightly larger share in future rounds, there's no guarantee of that.  Plus, the risk of Bob getting a larger share due to inflation is a real concern."
