"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 to get started. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you with 40% for now. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40% share, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

Since the money is worth 40% less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55% now, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to push for a bigger share.

After considering his offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 55% of the remaining money, especially considering the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another proposal!

Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
