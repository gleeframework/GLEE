I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer for Bob. Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept early on and we both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not going to accept that. I'm going to wait until it's my turn to propose again.  I'll likely offer a little less for Bob, but hopefully, he'll realize that it's better than getting nothing in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still giving Bob a significant portion of the money. Since we're already in the third round, I think it's time to start getting serious about securing a deal.  Let's see if he's more willing to negotiate now."
