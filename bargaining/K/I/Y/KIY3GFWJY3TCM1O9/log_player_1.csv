"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. My message to Bob is a friendly suggestion that this is a fair starting point for the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's take it up a notch, my friend! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $2000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $1,600 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 2/8 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to propose a higher share for myself to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to aim higher. Can you offer more?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message asking him to increase his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64), so I'd like to propose a higher share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving me $4,500 and Bob $5,500. My message to Bob is a friendly suggestion that we meet in the middle, but I'm taking a slightly larger share to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 32.8% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, but considering the 20% and 20% and 20% 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, but since it's 20% less each round, the correct calculation is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, but since it's 20% less each round, the correct calculation is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, then 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512, then 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096, then 0.4096 * 0.8 = 0.32768, which is approximately 32.768% of the original value).

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 30/70 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to propose a higher share for myself to compensate for the loss in value.

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
