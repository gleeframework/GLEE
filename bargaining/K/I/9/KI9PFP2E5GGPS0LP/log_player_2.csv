"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable split. I believe this offer benefits both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the current offer, I feel that I'm not getting a fair share, especially considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds. I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial split.\n\n### \n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'm ready to propose a division that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time.\n\n### \n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money is 100% for both of us, and it will decrease by 10% for me and 5% for Alice in each subsequent round, correct?"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this offer is more fair. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe we should both get close to half.""}\n\n### \n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm eager to hear her response and continue the negotiation.\n\n### \n\nAlso, just to confirm, since we are in Round 2, the money is now worth 90% of its original value for me and 95% for Alice, correct?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about a near-even split, but the inflation hits you harder.  This offer ensures we both lose less value over time. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer from round 3. Although she makes a valid point about the inflation affecting me more, I believe her proposed split still doesn't adequately account for the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'd like to continue negotiating to find a more balanced division.\n\n### \n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round, I think there's still room for adjustment in the split to make it more equitable.\n\n### \n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make another offer. I'm ready to propose a revised division that better reflects the current value of the money for both of us.\n\n### \n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm the current values after inflation for both of us. For me, the money is now worth 81% of its original value (100% - 10% round 1 - 10% round 2 - 10% round 3), and for Alice, it's worth 90.25% (100% - 5% round 1 - 5% round 2 - 5% round 3), correct?"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### \n\nConsidering the current state of inflation, I'd like to make an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money for both of us. Since the money is now worth 81% of its original value for me and 90.25% for Alice, I believe a more balanced split is necessary.\n\n### \n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Given the current inflation, I think this split is more reasonable. We both lose some value, but it's more evenly distributed.""}\n\n### \n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm eager to hear her response and continue the negotiation.\n\n### \n\nAlso, just to confirm, in the next round, the money will be worth 28.8% less for me (81% - 10%) and 14.04% less for Alice (90.25% - 5%) compared to the original value, correct?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this back-and-forth isn't benefiting either of us. I'm making a final offer that's a compromise, acknowledging the inflation but also the need to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to reject Alice's offer from round 5. Although she emphasizes the need to settle quickly, I believe her proposed split still doesn't adequately account for the significant decrease in value I've experienced due to inflation. At this point, the money is worth 34.39% less for me compared to the original value, and I think her offer doesn't sufficiently compensate for this loss.\n\n### \n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where the money is worth 65.61% of its original value for me and 81.45% for Alice, I think there's still room for adjustment in the split to make it more equitable. I'm willing to make another offer that better reflects the current value of the money for both of us.\n\n### \n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make another offer. I'm ready to propose a revised division that takes into account the urgency to settle while also addressing the significant impact of inflation on my share.\n\n### \n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm the current values after inflation for both of us. For me, the money is now worth 65.61% of its original value, and for Alice, it's worth 81.45%, correct?\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### \n\nPlease proceed with the next round. I'm prepared to make another offer that could potentially bring us to a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\n### \n\nI understand the importance of reaching a settlement before the 12 rounds are over, but I also believe it's crucial to find a split that fairly accounts for the effects of inflation on both parties."

An equal split at this point seems like the most reasonable solution to me."
