"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 75-25. I think it's fair considering the potential decrease in value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept such a lopsided offer in the first round, especially considering the potential for inflation. By rejecting, Bob can see how Alice reacts to the threat of inflation and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This acknowledges the potential for inflation while still being fair.  Let's end this quickly.""}
