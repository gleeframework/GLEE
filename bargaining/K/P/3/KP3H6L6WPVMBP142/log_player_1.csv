Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's important to keep in mind that Bob's share is worth 10% less in the next round, so it's not too unfair. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to take the 5000$ now than risk getting nothing.  The inflation will hurt Bob more than me in the next round, so it's likely he wouldn't offer this much again."
