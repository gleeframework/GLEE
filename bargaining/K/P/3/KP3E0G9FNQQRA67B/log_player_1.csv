"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for my efforts.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to give you more than last round, but I need a larger share to keep up with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each passing round! I need to think carefully about this offer.

Bob is right that he needs a larger share to keep up with inflation, and his offer of 600,000 is a significant increase from last round. However, I'm not sure if it's enough for me to accept.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to be even more strategic with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need a slight edge to make this deal worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
