"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I still have a 80% share in mind. Bob's offer of 50% is a significant reduction from my initial proposal. I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has been eating away at the value of the money, and Bob's offer was already 20% less than my initial proposal, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the erosion of value.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

I'm offering to take 75% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a relatively good one for him, given the current value of the money. My initial proposal of 75% still seems reasonable, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still aiming for a 80% share. However, I'm willing to compromise. Bob's offer is close to my target, but I'm not sure if I want to give him the upper hand.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The value of the money is continuing to erode, and I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Given that Bob's offer in Round 4 was 60% of the remaining value, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the further decrease in value.

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800
}
```

I'm offering to take 72% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is continuing to drop rapidly, and Bob's offer is now significantly higher than my previous proposal. Given that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation.

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'm willing to compromise further. Bob's offer is now a 75% share, which is higher than my previous target. I'll accept this offer to avoid further erosion of the value.
