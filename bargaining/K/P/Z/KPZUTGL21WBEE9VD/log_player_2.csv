"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation you're immune to. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is seemingly fair, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since Alice's money is worth less with each round, I want to see if I can get a better deal by rejecting and letting her make a proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but I need to make sure I get a fair share considering the inflation you face. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm feeling the inflation pinch. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, Alice's offer is fair and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the future. Accepting guarantees me a significant share and avoids further risk of inflation impacting the deal."
