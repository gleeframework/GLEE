"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm taking a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is generous enough.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more equal division. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
