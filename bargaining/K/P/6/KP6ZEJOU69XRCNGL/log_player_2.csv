"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a very unfair offer, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by rejecting and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a fairer split. We both get a good chunk, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I'm being generous, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still quite unfair, even though she's calling it her final offer. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option, and we both get a good amount considering the inflation.""}
```"
