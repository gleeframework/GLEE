"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly.""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is a reasonable 40% of the total amount. This way, we can end the game quickly and avoid losing value due to inflation. The message ""Let's divide it fairly"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is more reflective of the time value.  Let's close this out now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Bob, I think I can take advantage of Bob's eagerness to close the deal and make a counteroffer that favors me. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $4200, which is slightly less than what I offered in Round 1, but still a reasonable amount considering the inflation. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness, as I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game soon.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is literally money in this game!  I'm offering a fair, even split to end this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of an even split, with both of us gaining $5000. Although the money is worth 14.26% less to me and 27.1% less to Bob compared to the first round, I think this is a fair deal considering the increasing effects of inflation. Bob's message emphasizes the importance of ending the game quickly to minimize losses, and I agree that it's better to settle now rather than risking further devaluation. By accepting this offer, we can both walk away with a reasonable amount, and I'm satisfied with the outcome.\n\nThe game is over!"
