# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. Given that Bob's offer is 30% for me and 70% for him, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer for now, as I'm hoping to get a better deal. My message to Bob will be:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low share. Let's keep negotiating.""
}
```"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
