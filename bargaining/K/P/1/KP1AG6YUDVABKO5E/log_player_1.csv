"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob! Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round and another 5% less after the second round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. But I'm still not ready to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not willing to give up more than 5200. I'm hoping Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. I'll have to be careful with my next offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. Meet me here?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and giving Bob a decent offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! Let's try to find a 50/50 split again. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I'm not sure if I should take the 50/50 split now, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50/50 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later."
