"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous, I'll try to do better this time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value, the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5700
* Bob gain: 7000

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob. 

```
