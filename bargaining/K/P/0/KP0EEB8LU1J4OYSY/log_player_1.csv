"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and I'll take $6000, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair division, but I'm taking a bit more for myself. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation risk. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get more. A 55/45 split is not that far off from my initial offer, and I think I can negotiate for more. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good compromise, don't be greedy""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than before, taking into account the inflation that's already occurred. I'm trying to pressure Bob into accepting by implying that he's being greedy if he doesn't take this deal. Let's see how he reacts!"
