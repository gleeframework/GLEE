"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's losing value fast.  I'm coming down slightly, but let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about time being money, her offer is only slightly better.  It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if I can secure a better deal. The rate of inflation is hurting Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
