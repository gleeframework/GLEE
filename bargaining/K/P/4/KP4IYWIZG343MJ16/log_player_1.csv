I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to compromise.  I'll take $800,000, and let Bob have $200,000.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair solution.  Let's try to reach an agreement before the inflation makes things worse for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can do better with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my ask again to $700,000.  I'm starting to feel the pressure from inflation, but I'm still confident I can get a fair share.  This is a reasonable offer for both of us, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although this is less than I initially hoped for, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation and the limited rounds. A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
