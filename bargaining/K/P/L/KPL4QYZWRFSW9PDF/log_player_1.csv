"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it evenly.  Accept this, and we can enjoy the full value of our share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve more given the inflation. Accept and let's move on.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm also feeling the effects of inflation. Let's get this done, I'll take a bit less, but we need to settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not willing to give up too much, especially since I've already rejected a better offer from Bob earlier.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of my gain is now worth a mere 51.2% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be very cautious and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's getting desperate, let's split it down the middle. It's the best we can do at this point.""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about this, but I think it's the most reasonable offer I can make at this point."
