"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering to take 70% of the $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. My gain of $500,000 is equivalent to 50% of the original amount, which is a better deal for me than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
