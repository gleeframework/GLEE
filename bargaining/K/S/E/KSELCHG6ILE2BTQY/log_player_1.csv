"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that the money is worth less for you with each round. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me with each round, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 60% yet, let's keep negotiating""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's get a better deal now""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
