"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since you're losing value each round 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The value is decreasing, let's meet in the middle. This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. My turn to be a bit more aggressive 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic. While his offer isn't terrible, I need to hold out for a better deal. It's still early in the game, and conceding now will only encourage him to push for even more unfair splits."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I'm serious about finding a compromise, but it needs to be fair. This is my bottom line.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also drawing a line in the sand.  This offer is still favorable to me given the inflation, but it avoids being overly aggressive and potentially pushing Bob away from a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, and the value is dropping fast for you. I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's painful to accept this, but with the rate of inflation, waiting any longer is very risky.  Bob is unlikely to offer anything better, and I'd rather take this smaller share than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
