Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more even this time.  I'll take 55 and you get 45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not getting a worse deal compared to before.
