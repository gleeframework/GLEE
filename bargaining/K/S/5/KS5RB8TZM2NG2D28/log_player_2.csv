"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple and fair split, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself, since I only lose 10% per round while Alice loses 20%.  I'll see if I can get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a split that's more beneficial for both of us. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time.  It's a fairer reflection of our respective losses with the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation difference.  This is my compromise - it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is a good compromise. While I'd like more, the inflation difference means her offer is fair. It's better to take this than risk losing even more in the next round."
