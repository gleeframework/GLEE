"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going for a high initial offer. Since the money will be worth less in the next round, I want to secure a good portion of the pot.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is offering me $4000, but due to inflation, that's only worth $3200.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll take my chances in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and secure a larger share again, but I'll reduce my initial demand a bit, recognizing that Bob might be getting less generous.  It's a risk, but hopefully, he'll see the value in accepting this offer rather than facing further inflation and potential losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even with the inflation, $4500 is better than the $3200 I'd be getting if I reject and go into the next round.  Bob is likely playing strategically, knowing I'm under the pressure of inflation. It's time to cut my losses and accept this offer."
