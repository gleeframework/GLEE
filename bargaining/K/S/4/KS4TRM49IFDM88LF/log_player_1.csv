"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In the second round, my gain of $50 is worth 10% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $54. Bob's gain of $50 is worth 20% less than the $40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is $32.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal than me, I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round. My gain of $50 is worth 10% less, which is $45. Bob's gain of $50 is worth 20% less, which is $40.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still the one making the offer, so you should accept!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $45 is worth 27.1% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $43.64.
Bob's gain of $55 is worth 48.8% less than the $40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $20.80.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, you're getting a bit more than I initially offered, but it's still a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer and we can finish the game.""
}
