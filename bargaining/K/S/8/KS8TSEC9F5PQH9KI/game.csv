60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  This gives us both a reasonable share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I'd like to propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fairer deal than the previous offer.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but I need to factor in the inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split, but in my favor this time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's stick with a 60/40 split, but in my favor this time. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,This is getting us nowhere. Let's split 50/50 and call it a day.  The inflation is only going to get worse for me.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"I'm going to stick with a 70/30 split in my favor.  The inflation is heavily impacting Alice, so a compromise is necessary for us both to gain something.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to go as low as 45/55 again.  Take it or leave it - we are running out of time!",Alice,7,
