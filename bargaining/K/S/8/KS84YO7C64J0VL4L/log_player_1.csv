"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small amount to get us started. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $100,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair share and move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

The offer is a 40/60 split, which is not as favorable to me as my initial offer, but I'll consider it. However, I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risk of waiting for a better one.

I'll reject this offer for now and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round due to inflation, my gain will be worth 90.25% of what it was in the second round.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more balanced split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share than the 40% I would have gotten in Bob's previous offer, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we're making progress towards a fair split."
