Let's see if Bob agrees to this deal!  I'm feeling pretty confident with this offer, but I'll be ready to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept that. The offer is unfair, and I have 10 rounds left to negotiate a better deal!  Let's see what Bob does in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

Let's try a slightly less aggressive offer this time. I'm still feeling confident that I can get a good deal, but it's important to be flexible."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, and I'm not going to settle for such a low share. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise again, offering a bit more to Bob while still securing a majority of the money.  We're getting close to the halfway point of the game, so I need to start making progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still losing a lot due to inflation. I need to be more assertive and try to get a better deal in the next round.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

Inflation is really hurting me now, but I'm still going to try and hold out for a decent share. I'm going to offer a bit more to Bob, but I'm still aiming for a majority. We are getting into the later rounds and time is running out."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that!  Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfair.  We're getting close to the end, and the money I receive is worth less and less each round. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With inflation steadily decreasing the value of my share, I need to secure a more even split. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, and I hope Bob will see reason. Time is running out, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
