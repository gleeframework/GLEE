Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiations. Given the significant impact of inflation on your side, I believe this offer is now more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough one! While I'd like to hold out for a better deal, the inflation is really hurting me. Accepting Bob's offer now yields me the equivalent of $7738 in round 1 value. 

If I reject his offer and he proposes a 50/50 split in the next round, I'll only receive the equivalent of $7350 in round 1 value. Further rounds will only diminish my potential gains. It's better to take the sure thing now, even if it's frustratingly close to my initial offer."
