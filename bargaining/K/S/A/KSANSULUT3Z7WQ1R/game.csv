7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the potential decrease in value over time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that I am bearing a greater risk of inflation in this round. Let's end this early and avoid further devaluation.,Bob,2,
