"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $9,000 (10,000 - 10% of 10,000). My proposal was for $8,000, but now it's equivalent to $8,000 / 0.9 = $8,889. I'm not getting a better deal with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the total amount is now $7,273.10 ($10,000 - 27.1% of $10,000).

I'll calculate the equivalent value of my previous offer: $8,000 / 0.723 = $11,054, which is more than the current total amount. My previous offer is not feasible in this round.

Bob's offer is $4,000, which is equivalent to $4,000 / 0.723 = $5,523. I'll accept it.
