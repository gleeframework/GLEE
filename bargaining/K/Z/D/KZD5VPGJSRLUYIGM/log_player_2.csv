# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 4

# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept this offer. The inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential gain, and I don't think I'll get a better offer in the next round. It's time to settle."
