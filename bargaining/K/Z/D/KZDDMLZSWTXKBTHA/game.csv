60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take 60 and you take 40.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly because of the inflation.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think we can find a more balanced split. I propose you take 45 and I take 55. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the inflation affecting our gains.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  My turn to propose a more balanced split.  I'll take 55 and you take 45. This ensures we both benefit before the inflation eats away at the value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, we're both losing value with each round. Let's be practical. I'll take 60, and you take 40. This way, we both get a decent share before the inflation gets out of hand.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The inflation is hurting us both.  Let's split it evenly, 50/50.  A fair deal so we both leave with something substantial.",Alice,5,
