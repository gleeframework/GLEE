"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this initial round, Alice has offered Bob $4000 and herself $6000. Considering the impact of inflation, if Bob rejects this offer and the game proceeds to the next round, the money's value will decrease by 5% for Bob and 10% for Alice. This means that in the next round, the total value of the money will be lower, but the proportional decrease is higher for Alice. Therefore, Bob might have an advantage in negotiating a better split in subsequent rounds due to the differing rates of inflation affecting their shares. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a potentially more favorable division in the next round or to negotiate further, taking into account the decreasing value of the money, especially for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the fact that Alice's share decreases more significantly with each round, Bob should aim to negotiate a split that takes this into account. Given that the money's value decreases by 5% for Bob and 10% for Alice each round, Bob might propose a division that slightly favors himself more than the initial offer but still remains reasonable for Alice to consider, given the decreasing value of her share over time.
