{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we need to account for.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. Inflation is a factor, but we both lose more with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution to avoid further losses.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
