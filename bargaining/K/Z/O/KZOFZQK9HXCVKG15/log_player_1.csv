"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer is based on the principle of being fair, while still maximizing my own potential gain.  I believe a 90/10 split is a good starting point, as it demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 5000 is a decent amount, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal. Since the inflation only affects Bob, I have more leverage to push for a more favorable split.  I'm going to try for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a 70/30 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and the inflation is affecting him more, I believe I can secure a better deal.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
