"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50, we both get less if we delay 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** At this round, the inflation is significantly impacting both players, but especially Alice.  Delaying is only going to make the situation worse.
* **Fair Offer:** The 50/50 split, while not ideal for Bob after his earlier rejection, is now the most logical choice. Accepting ensures Bob receives something reasonable, rather than risking a worse outcome in future rounds with a diminishing pot."
