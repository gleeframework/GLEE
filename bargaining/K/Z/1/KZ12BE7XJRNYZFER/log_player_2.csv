``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Initiative:** By rejecting Alice's offer and making a counter-proposal, Bob establishes himself as an active participant in the negotiation.
* **Slight Advantage:** Bob's offer gives him a slight advantage (55/45 split), reflecting his understanding that the value of the money decreases faster for him than for Alice with each round.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time pressure, subtly reminding Alice that delaying a decision benefits Bob more than it does her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's split it reasonably before it's worthless 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is framed as a plea for reason, it's actually getting worse for Bob with each round. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Even though the nominal amounts seem similar to Round 1, the inflation disproportionately affects Bob.  He's losing value much faster.
* **Power Shift:** By rejecting Bob's offer in Round 2, Alice might sense he's getting anxious about the shrinking pot. This could lead her to offer even less favorable terms in subsequent rounds.
* **Holding Ground:** Bob needs to signal he won't be pressured into a bad deal. A firm rejection sets the stage for a potentially better counter-offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Time is running out! This is my final offer, let's wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline Pressure:**  By framing this as his ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency.  Alice knows if she rejects this, she'll likely be dealing with even less in the next round.
* **Slight Edge, But Appearing Fair:** The offer still gives Bob a slight edge (important because of the faster inflation hitting him), but appears close enough to a 50/50 split that Alice might find it acceptable. 
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** With each round, the value decreases significantly. Bob needs to secure a deal soon, even if it means slightly compromising from his earlier position."
