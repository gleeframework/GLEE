"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a fair offer to start with. I'm giving Bob 10% of the money, but I still keep the majority for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even accounting for the inflation on his end. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 8000, but still keeping a majority. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise."

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse. While the inflation is hitting him hard, it's still a much worse deal for me than my initial proposal, even accounting for the inflation on his end.  I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm again lowering my offer a bit, to 7000, but still retaining a majority. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that's significantly worse than what I initially offered."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm further reducing my offer to 6000, but still keeping a majority. Inflation is starting to become a significant factor, but I'm still willing to compromise to reach an agreement before the time runs out."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, despite the inflation affecting him. I'm still hoping to get a better deal, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can achieve that."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We are now down to the wire, and I need to act fast. Inflation is heavily impacting Bob's potential gains, but he seems adamant about getting a larger share. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like the fairest option considering the circumstances.  This is a high-risk move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency of the situation and accept this offer."
