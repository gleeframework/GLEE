I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even with the inflation, getting 50% of the money is better than risking a lower share in the next round."
