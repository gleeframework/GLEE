"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair, and I believe we can find a better division. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Alice. This offer is more reasonable, considering we both want a fair share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you! I'm being more than fair, take the deal while it's still good! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll proceed to the next round. Although the value of money is decreasing for me, I still believe we can find a more balanced division. Alice's offer, despite the urgency, doesn't quite meet my expectations. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the decreasing value of money for me, I'm willing to compromise further. This offer reflects a more balanced division, taking into account the current situation. Let's settle on this before it's too late for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the inflation pinch. I'm offering you a better deal than you'll get if this goes another round. Let's be smart and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in Round 5. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer of a 45-55 split seems more reasonable at this point. Continuing to another round would further decrease the value of my share, potentially making this the best offer I'll receive considering the circumstances. It's time to finalize the agreement before the value of my share drops any further."
