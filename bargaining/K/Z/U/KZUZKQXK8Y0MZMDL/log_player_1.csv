"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and with the inflation, it's the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer might seem fair on the surface, but the inflation heavily favors me in the long run. While he loses value faster, I can secure a much better deal if I wait him out just a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm feeling generous, but we need to act fast before inflation eats away at our potential gains!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm applying a bit more pressure while still maintaining a deal that would be significantly to my advantage. Bob is likely feeling the heat of the inflation and will be more inclined to accept a somewhat less favorable deal than see his potential earnings dwindle further."
