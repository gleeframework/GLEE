"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now, so I'll need to adjust my expectations. Meeting halfway is a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to get a bit more.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after Round 2, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a larger share, but still leave room for negotiation.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close, Bob. Meet me here!""
}
```"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, Alice. Don't be shy! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to adjust my expectations accordingly. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than his previous one, but I'm still not getting the share I'd like.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm calling the shots now!""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not yet, Alice. I'm not giving up! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a lot less now, and I need to be more careful with my decisions. Bob's offer is still not ideal, but it's getting closer to what I'd like.

I'll accept Bob's offer and hope it's the best I can get.
