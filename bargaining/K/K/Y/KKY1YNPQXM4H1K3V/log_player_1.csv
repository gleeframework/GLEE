"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and we can re-negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point, and leaves Bob with 40%. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair starting point and avoids any unnecessary inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to split it evenly now!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round (6000 * 0.8 = 4800), and Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 90% of what he would have gotten in the first round (4000 * 0.9 = 3600).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's not as favorable as my initial proposal. However, I don't want to reject it outright, so I'll make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about splitting it evenly. Can we discuss a better ratio?""
}
```

I'm giving Bob the opportunity to respond and try to negotiate a better deal for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the previous round, my gain of $5000 is now worth 64% of what it would have been in the first round (6000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 3840), and Bob's gain of $5000 is now worth 81% of what he would have gotten in the first round (4000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 3240).

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a slight edge. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a bit, but let's be fair. This offer is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Let's calculate the values in terms of the original amount:

My gain of $4500 is worth 45% of what I would have gotten in the first round (6000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 3840 * 0.1175 = 450.72, then 4500 is approximately 45% of 10,000).

Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 55% of what he would have gotten in the first round (4000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 2916 * 1.8857 = 5500 is approximately 55% of 10,000).

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually quite generous from Bob's perspective. I'm not sure if I want to accept it, but I don't want to reject it outright either. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the concession, but I'd like to get a bit more. Can we meet in the middle again?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is still eating away at our potential gains!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob compared to the first round, my gain of $4500 is now worth 45% of what it would have been in the first round (6000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 3840 * 0.1175 = 450.72, then 4500 is approximately 45% of 10,000), and Bob's gain of $5500 is now worth 55% of what he would have gotten in the first round (4000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 2916 * 1.8857 = 5500 is approximately 55% of 10,000).

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair share. Can you meet me at this compromise?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to make a deal before things get worse. This offer is generous, considering the inflation we've both faced, and it allows us to walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Let's calculate the values in terms of the original amount:

My gain of $4000 is worth 40% of what I would have gotten in the first round (6000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 1536 * 0.2604 = 4000 is approximately 40% of 10,000).

Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 60% of what he would have gotten in the first round (4000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 2916 * 2.0618 = 6000 is approximately 60% of 10,000).

Considering the severe inflation, this offer is actually quite generous from Bob's perspective. I'm not sure if I want to accept it, but I don't want to risk losing everything. I'll make a final attempt to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, but I'd like to get a bit more. Can we meet in the middle one last time?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to make one last concession."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair share. Let's end this on a good note.""
}

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for Bob to accept and end the game on a positive note."
