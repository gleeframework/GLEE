"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI offer a 55-45 split, slightly in my favor, but still a relatively fair division. This opening proposal allows room for negotiation while considering the impact of inflation on my share in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting 4500 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I'd accepted a similar amount in the first round. Since I started with a proposal slightly in my favor and Bob has countered with one more in his favor, there's still room to negotiate for a more balanced split considering the devaluation of my share over rounds. I'll reject this offer to try and find a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm adjusting my proposal to a 52-48 split, slightly reducing my share from the initial offer but still aiming to counterbalance the loss due to inflation. This approach shows willingness to compromise while also protecting my interests as the value of my potential gain decreases over time."
