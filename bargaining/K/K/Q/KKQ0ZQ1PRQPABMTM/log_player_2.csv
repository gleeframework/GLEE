"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  This way we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split?  Time is money, and it's ticking away!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to take a little less, but we need to move quickly before the value of the money drops too much for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  I'm banking on her fear of inflation to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to meet in the middle, but *we're* meeting on *my* middle ground.  55/45. Take it or leave it, because the clock is ticking!""}"
