"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  This way, we both get a good share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking with inflation.  Let's close this out and both walk away with a good amount.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was too one-sided. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is fair, considering the risk you took by rejecting my initial offer. We can end this now and avoid further inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

""alice_gain"": 450000,
