"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share and we can negotiate further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20% of the initial $100, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split would be fairer. Let's try 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60/40 is a bit too skewed in your favor, I'd like to try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer, but I'm open to further negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain by 20% again, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more for myself to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
