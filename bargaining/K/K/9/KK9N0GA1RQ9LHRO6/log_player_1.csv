"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable split, Bob. This gives us both a good amount.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Early advantage:**  I'm taking advantage of the fact that the money devalues faster for me. A 60/40 split in my favor now is better than potentially getting a smaller share later.
* **Appearing fair:**  While I'm aiming for a larger share, I don't want to start with an offer so extreme that Bob will immediately reject it. This offer could be perceived as reasonably fair, increasing the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rate affects you more heavily. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation difference, it heavily favors him. Accepting this would mean I lose out significantly in the long run. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of accepting a deal that's clearly worse for me than my initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation disparity, but your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This offer is a compromise, still acknowledging you'll lose less value over time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground to encourage a deal but still maintaining a slight advantage for myself considering the inflation difference.
* **Clear communication:** I'm clearly explaining my reasoning for rejecting Bob's previous offer and why my current offer is a fairer compromise. 
* **Time pressure:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to keep in mind that each round reduces the value of the money for me. I don't want to drag this out too long."
