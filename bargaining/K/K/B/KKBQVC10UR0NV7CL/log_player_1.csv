"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10.  It's a fair starting point considering I am the one initiating the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 

I'm offering an 85/15 split, which is a compromise considering Bob's previous offer. I'm willing to reduce my share slightly, but I want to maintain a larger portion as the proposer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While the inflation has decreased the value of the money, the 70/30 split is still better than the 85/15 offer I proposed in the previous round. I'd rather secure something now than risk ending up with nothing after further rounds."
