"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide the money almost equally, considering I made the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, but it's my turn to propose now.  Let's be equitable considering the inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Let's settle on this before the money devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the decreasing value as leverage, but her offer is still not advantageous to me. I need to push for a better split while we still have rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and our potential gains are shrinking. I'm proposing a more realistic split to reflect the diminishing value and give us both a good deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, let's just split it down the middle and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further devaluation and potentially walking away with nothing. Alice is unlikely to accept an offer where she receives less than half, especially as the value continues to decrease."
