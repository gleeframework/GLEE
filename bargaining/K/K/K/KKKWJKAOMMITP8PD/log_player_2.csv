"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer. It's a fair starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, knowing that the money will be worth less in each subsequent round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slight risk to see if we can both do better. Let's try this for now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some buffer for myself 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer to keep negotiating, the inflation is starting to have a real impact. I'm taking a slight loss compared to my initial offer, but it's still better than getting nothing. It's important to be realistic and secure a deal before things get worse."
