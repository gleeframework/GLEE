"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate fairness, Alice, but I'm more focused on us actually getting something. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This offer is still good for both of us, but we need to act fast.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing. This is a strong offer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, Bob's offer is getting worse for us with each round due to inflation. It's time to push back more firmly, but still leave room for negotiation. Accepting now would mean a significant loss compared to our initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous. I need you to meet me closer to the middle, otherwise this is going nowhere.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're halfway there and this is getting us nowhere.  This offer is a compromise, and it gives us both something worthwhile before the value drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for us. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a less favorable deal now than risk getting nothing at all if we continue to reject Bob's offers."
