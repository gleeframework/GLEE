"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose a division of $99 for me and $1 for Bob. Since this is the first round, I'm assuming there's no significant inflation yet. I want to maximize my share while still making it somewhat ""fair"" for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, inflation is a factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me $50, and with the next round, the money I get could be worth less due to inflation."
