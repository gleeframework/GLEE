"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, it's equivalent to $800,000 in the original amount. I'll offer:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less for me each round. I'll have to be careful. I'll accept this offer, since it's better than going into the next round with even less value. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
