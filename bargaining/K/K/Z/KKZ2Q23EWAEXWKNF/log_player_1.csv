"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm not getting as much as I wanted, but I'll have to consider it. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not losing any value due to inflation. Bob's gain, however, is worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
