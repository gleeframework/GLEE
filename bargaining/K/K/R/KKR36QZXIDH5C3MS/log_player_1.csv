"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to keep $99 for myself, and give Bob $1. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round, as he's unlikely to get much better in the future with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice.  The money is losing value with each round, so I need to secure a decent amount.  Even with inflation, getting $50 is better than potentially getting less in future rounds."
