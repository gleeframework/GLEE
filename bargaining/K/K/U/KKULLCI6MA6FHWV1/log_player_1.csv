"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, let's try to find a better compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. Given that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not eager to give up too much. However, I'm willing to compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a better deal for me than going to the next round and risking further inflation.
