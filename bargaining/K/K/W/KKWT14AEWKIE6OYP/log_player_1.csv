"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to give Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the money will be worth less for him due to the 20% discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because it's not significantly better than my previous offer, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the money is worth 10% less now (5% less from the first round and another 5% from the second round), I'll make a more aggressive offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
