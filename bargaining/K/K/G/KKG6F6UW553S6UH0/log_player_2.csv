Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. 50/50 seems like the most sensible way to split this.  We can keep playing, but inflation will eat away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
