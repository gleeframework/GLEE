"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you'll still get something. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer is initially tempting, it's important to consider the potential for a better deal in the future. Since the money is losing value with each round, rejecting the offer and having the chance to propose in the next round might lead to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split. You get a good amount, and I can still secure a decent share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the money is losing value with each round, it's important for Bob to secure a good chunk of the money before it depreciates further. Offering a 60/40 split gives Bob a significant advantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to potentially accept, especially considering the inflation factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair compromise, considering the last round. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's gain has depreciated significantly due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option at this point. The money has lost value, and there's no guarantee that Alice will offer a better split in the next round.  Accepting Alice's proposal ensures Bob still receives a substantial portion of the remaining value."
