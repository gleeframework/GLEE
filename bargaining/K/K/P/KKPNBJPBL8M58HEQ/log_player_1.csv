"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a small share to get the ball rolling.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $6000 I would gain is actually worth 90% of the original $9000 I would have gained in the first round, which is $8100. The $4000 Bob would gain is worth 80% of the original $1000, which is $800.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm not getting as much as I initially wanted, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.
