I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000.  This is a good starting point that shows I'm willing to negotiate fairly, but I'm also aiming for a large share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly to 850,000 but increasing Bob's to 150,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to be fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly worse than my last offer, and with the increased inflation, I'm losing a lot more. I'll stick to my own strategy of gradually reducing my share, but only to a point where I still get the majority."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share again to 800,000, but still keeping the majority.  It's a small step, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to continue negotiating, while still ensuring I get a significant share."
