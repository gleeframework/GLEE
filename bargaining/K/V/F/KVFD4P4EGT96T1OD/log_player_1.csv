I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Since the money is worth less each round, I want to get as much as possible early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I'm losing value each round, I'm losing it at a much faster rate than Bob. This offer is significantly worse than the one I made in the first round. I'll wait to make my own proposal and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal than my first offer.  While Bob's offer was very unfair, I don't want to risk him accepting it.  I'm still losing value faster than Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to settle for a smaller share rather than risk losing even more in the next round."
