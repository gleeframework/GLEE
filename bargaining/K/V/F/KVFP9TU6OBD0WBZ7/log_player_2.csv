# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another offer. The inflation is affecting Alice more than me, so I'll try to use that to my advantage."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting us nowhere, Bob. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. $5000 each. 
# Bob gain: 5000
