"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, easy and fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a slightly bigger share, I see!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up just yet! I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's closer to my original 50/50 proposal, but still a bit more favorable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting greedy!

I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity in the split. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to even things out a bit.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's try to meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split a bit more in my favor, but still being reasonable. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
