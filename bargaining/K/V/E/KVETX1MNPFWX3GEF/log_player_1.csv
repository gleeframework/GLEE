"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate more if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate if he's not satisfied with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, so I need to adjust my strategy. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 450,000. I'll wait for the next round to make my next move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, indicating that I'm not willing to give up much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up, I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now. I'll think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $400,000 is a reasonable amount, considering the decreasing value of the money. I think it's time to end the game and take what I can get."
