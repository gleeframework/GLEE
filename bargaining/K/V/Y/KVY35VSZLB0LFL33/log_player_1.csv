Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair starting offer. While I am trying to get the most money possible, I am also willing to compromise to ensure a deal gets made in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing all the money by continuing to reject offers."
