Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5200

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation and the time pressure.  While his offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, I'm betting he'll be willing to concede more as the rounds progress and the potential losses from inflation increase."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking and we both lose if this fails. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and inflation is rapidly eroding the value. 
* **Strong Stance:**  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He has to now seriously consider if he's willing to risk getting nothing at all. 
* **Reasonable Split:** While I'm aiming for a slight advantage, it's not drastically unfair to Bob, especially given the circumstances."
