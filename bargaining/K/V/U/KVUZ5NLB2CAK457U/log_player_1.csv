"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20 dollars, and I'll take 80 dollars.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about the offer.

I'm not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation effect, so I'll assume he's not. Given the new offer, I'd rather take a larger share to account for the reduced value of money. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll aim for a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60 dollars to account for the inflation. It's a fair deal, considering the reduced value of money.""
}
```"
