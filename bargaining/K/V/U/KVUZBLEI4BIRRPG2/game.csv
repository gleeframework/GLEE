500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it down the middle. Inflation is hitting us both, so a fair 50/50 seems like the best way to go.",Alice,5,

350000.0,650000.0,"I'm not convinced that 50/50 is the best way to go, especially considering I'm taking on more risk with each passing round. I'll take a bit more this time.",Bob,6,

400000.0,600000.0,I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further losses due to inflation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.,Alice,7,

250000.0,750000.0,I'm not going to back down now. I need a bigger share to make up for the losses due to inflation. This is my final offer.,Bob,10,
