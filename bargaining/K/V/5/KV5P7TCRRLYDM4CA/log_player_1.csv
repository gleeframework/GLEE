"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was a bit too optimistic with my initial offer.

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'm willing to accept a 25-75 split. I'd like to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping Bob will consider it a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll accept this offer. A 45-55 split is a bit closer to what I was hoping for, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being even less valuable."
