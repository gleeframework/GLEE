Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter-offer: 58-42 split. Don't let inflation eat away your share! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, 57-43 is a fair deal now. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly significant, accepting this offer would leave me with substantially less than half of the initial amount.  It's worth risking another round or two to try and secure a better deal.  Alice is clearly aiming to maximize her share and take advantage of the inflation working against me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at my share further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is of the essence. But I think 56-44 is more suitable considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, with the current inflation rate, waiting any longer could result in an even worse outcome. Accepting 440,000 is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds and losing a significant portion of potential earnings."
