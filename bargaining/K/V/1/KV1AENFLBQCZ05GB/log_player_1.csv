  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures we both get a fair share of the money, and we don't have to worry about the decreasing value for me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
