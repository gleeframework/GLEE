"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor.  I want to keep the majority of the money, but still offer Bob something to incentivize him to accept.  I'm hoping he'll accept this deal in the first round, as I'm confident he'll be willing to negotiate a smaller share for himself in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is worse than my original offer, and the money is now worth less. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly to 800,000 and increase Bob's to 200,000. I think this is still a good deal for me, considering the inflation, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have to recalculate my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his offer in round 2. I'm still losing a lot of money due to inflation, but I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my share again to 700,000 and increase Bob's to 300,000.  I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, but I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and making an offer Bob might accept. I'm hoping that with each round, he will be more inclined to accept a smaller share for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round or at least avoid accepting an offer that is worth significantly less than what I proposed earlier."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 600,000 and increasing Bob's to 400,000.  I'm still losing a lot of money due to inflation, but I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept. We are getting closer to the end of the game, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing."
