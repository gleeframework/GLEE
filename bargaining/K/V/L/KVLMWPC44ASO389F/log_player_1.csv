"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the difference!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer, but it's actually a pretty standard 60-40 split. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair and reasonable offer, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad try, Bob!

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think this offer is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Half and half, a perfectly balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A perfectly balanced split, indeed!

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""

```

I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm happy to split the $1,000,000 evenly with Bob. Game over!"
