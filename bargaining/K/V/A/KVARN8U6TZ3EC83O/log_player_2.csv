"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's previous offer was 3000$ for me, I'll try to increase my share. However, I also need to be mindful of the inflation factor, which reduces the value of money over time. Let's aim for a higher share while keeping in mind that the money's value will decrease by 20% each round.
