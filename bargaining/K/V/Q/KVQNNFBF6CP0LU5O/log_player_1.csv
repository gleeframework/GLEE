"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is a little fairer, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's agree on this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,500 is worth 5% less than the $6,000 I proposed in the first round, which is a decent deal.

However, Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 10% less than the $4,000 he offered in the first round, which is a relatively good deal for him.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation. Let's try to finalize it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,800 and keeping $5,200 for myself. I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the previous offers, while still being reasonable."
