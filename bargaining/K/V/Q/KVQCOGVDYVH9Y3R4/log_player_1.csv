Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 999,999 dollars for myself and leaving 1 dollar for Bob.  This way, I can secure most of the money, and Bob still gets a small amount.  

I'm assuming that Bob will be more likely to accept this in the first round as he has no information about the inflation rate and how it might affect his future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation rate has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split is the most reasonable option at this point."
