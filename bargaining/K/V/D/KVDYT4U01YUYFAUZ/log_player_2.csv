"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our two offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a little longer. The pressure of inflation is on both of us, and I believe I can secure a slightly better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is a good compromise to avoid further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference again, inflation is starting to hurt 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a worse deal or even nothing as we get closer to the deadline."
