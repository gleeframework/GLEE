# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer seems fair at first glance, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself. I know that the money will be worth less in the next round, but I believe I can negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55/45,  giving you a bit more than the previous offer, but still leaving me with a good share. What do you say?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think 70/30 is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hopeful of getting a better deal. While Alice is offering more, I believe I can still negotiate a higher share for myself, especially considering the inflation effects.  I'll try to counter her offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little more than the previous offer, but I need a bigger share to offset the inflation. Let's split it 60/40, which gives you a better deal than the last round and still leaves me with a good share. I think this is a fair compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a big risk and give you a smaller share, but I think 80/20 is the best deal considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a significantly smaller share than I hoped for, I'm accepting this offer. With inflation continuing to erode the value of money, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal in the future.  It's better to take what's on the table now than risk getting nothing at all."
