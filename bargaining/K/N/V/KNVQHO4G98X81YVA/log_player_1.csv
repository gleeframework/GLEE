"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000$ and leave Bob with 100,000$.  This leaves a good amount for him, and with the inflation, I figure I can take a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  Bob's offer is much worse than my offer from the previous round, even with the inflation.  I will try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose taking 800,000$ and leaving Bob with 200,000$.  While this is less than my previous offer, I need to account for the inflation, and I believe this is still a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse. While his offer is only slightly less than my offer from the previous round, the inflation has reduced my gain significantly. I need to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose taking 700,000$ and leaving Bob with 300,000$. This is still a decent share for Bob considering the inflation, and it gives me a better chance of getting a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is improving, but it's still less than my previous offer after inflation. I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my offer a bit more to account for inflation, but I still believe this is a fair deal.  I'm hoping that Bob will start to see that we need to come to an agreement soon, or we'll both lose a lot of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 620000 
# Bob gain: 380000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is better than what I could get by rejecting it and making a counter-offer.  The inflation is killing my potential gains, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
