"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not giving away the whole thing!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, but I'm not giving away the farm just yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'm looking at $560,000 (700,000 - 20% of 700,000). Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he's getting $360,000.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to be a bit more generous, but still wants to keep a decent amount for himself. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the second round, my gain is worth 40% less than the original $700,000, so I'm looking at $420,000 (700,000 - 20% of 700,000 - 20% of the remaining 700,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
