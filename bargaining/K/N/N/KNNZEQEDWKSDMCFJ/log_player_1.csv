Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I'm not interested in playing games with the money, and I think a fair split is the best way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
