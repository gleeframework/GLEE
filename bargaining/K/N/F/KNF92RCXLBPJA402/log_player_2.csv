"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. I get $55 and you get $45. It's important to settle this early before inflation eats away at our money! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  We can still both walk away with a decent amount of money!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get a decent share before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is right. Inflation is a serious threat, and a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something.  Let's finish this before we lose too much more money."
