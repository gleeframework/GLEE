"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems fair.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? This split accounts for the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation affecting my potential earnings. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable distribution."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest option considering the time pressure and inflation.  Deal?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I'm sticking to a split that acknowledges the inflation, but I'm willing to compromise slightly. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continued rejection could lead to a much smaller gain or even nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in time."
