"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, but still favorable to me. I'm trying to appear fair and reasonable in my message, while also taking into account that the money will be worth less in future rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly.\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the current value of the money and adjust my offers accordingly in future rounds.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it seems fair on the surface, the money is now worth 20% less than it was in the first round. This means that the $50 I would get is actually equivalent to $40 in the first round, which is less than what I initially offered Bob. I'm hoping to get a better deal in future rounds or make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision.\n###\n\n###\n\nAlso, since we are in round 2, I'd like to make my next offer. \n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the inflation, but still trying to maintain an advantage. Let me know Bob's response.\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the current value of the money and adjust my offers accordingly in future rounds.)\n###\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my new offer.\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the money is now worth 80% of the initial value, which means we are now dividing $80. Is that correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since we are in round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the current value of the money, which is 80% * 80% = 64% of the initial value. This means we are now effectively dividing $64.\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, again""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making an offer that is slightly more generous to Bob than my previous one, considering the decreasing value of the money. However, I'm still trying to maintain an advantage, as the game is not over yet. Let me know Bob's response.\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the current value of the money and adjust my offers accordingly in future rounds.)\n###\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my new offer.\n###\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the money is now worth 64% of the initial value, which means we are now effectively dividing $64.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it takes into account the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, we are effectively dividing $51.20. Bob's offer of $45 for me is not bad, but I'm hoping to get a bit more or make a counteroffer that will give me an advantage.\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision.\n###\n\n###\n\nAlso, since we are in round 4, I'd like to make my next offer. \n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making an offer that is slightly more generous to myself than Bob's previous offer, considering the current value of the money. I'm trying to maintain an advantage while still being reasonable.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since we are in round 5, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the current value of the money, which is 51.20% * 80% = 40.96% of the initial value.
