Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure of inflation, but I still believe my share should be larger to compensate for the loss over time. How about this adjustment? 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her demands even with inflation factored in. I need to hold firm, but time is running out. If I continue rejecting, I need to make a counteroffer that's more appealing in the next round, or I risk getting a much worse deal as the deadline approaches."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Both sides are losing value due to inflation. Alice doesn't seem to grasp that her increasingly greedy offers will hurt her in the long run.
* **Strong Stance:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. This offer signals that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal and avoids the back-and-forth that wastes precious rounds. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the very real risk of losing even more to inflation if Alice doesn't accept."
