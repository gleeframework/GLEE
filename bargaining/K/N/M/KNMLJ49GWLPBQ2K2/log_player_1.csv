I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm also willing to offer Bob a small amount to avoid the risk of getting nothing if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still hoping for a bigger share of the money.  I think this offer is fair and gives Bob a decent amount while still securing a majority for me."
