"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small share, making it potentially acceptable.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This time, I'm lowering my share a bit more, hoping to entice Bob into accepting before the inflation affects him further. Let's see if this works!"
