"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation rates. Rejecting will allow Bob to make a proposal in the next round, where the money will be worth less for Alice.  This could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe this offer is fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's split the money in a way that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
The inflation is hitting hard, and the longer we play, the less valuable the money becomes. It's time to take the sure thing.  While I'd prefer a higher share, it's better than risking a worse outcome."
