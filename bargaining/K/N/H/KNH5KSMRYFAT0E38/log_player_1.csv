"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! Don't be greedy, I'm being generous.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is a 60/40 split, which is better than what you offered.  I'm hoping we can both walk away with a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being fair, but I'm not convinced. I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my original strategy of trying to get as much as possible, and I think I can do better than 40% in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a relatively small amount, hoping he'll think twice about rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round. It's time to compromise. Let's split the money evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to appeal to my sense of reason, but I'm not convinced that an even split is the best option for me. I'd rather try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 50/50, and I'm not willing to settle for a split that leaves me with less than I could potentially get."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Time to make a real decision.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even smaller share, hoping he'll realize that he needs to make a move soon or risk getting even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a bit more, but a 40/60 split is the best I can do right now.  If we don't reach an agreement, we'll both lose out even more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to negotiate, but I'm not sure if he's being sincere. I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 40/60 split is a decent compromise, and I think it's better than risking even more losses due to inflation."
