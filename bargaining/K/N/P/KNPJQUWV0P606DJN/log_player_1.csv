"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, I'm trying to find a balance that is somewhat fair but also acknowledges the urgency and the impact of inflation. My message to Bob emphasizes fairness but also reflects my advantage in making the first offer. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something fair. This considers the time pressure on your end. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Given the inflation rates, accepting $45 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a lower amount in the first round, considering the 20% decrease in value for me. I believe I can negotiate for a better split, taking into account the increasing pressure on both of us as the rounds progress. It's my turn again, and I'll try to find a more favorable division."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $58 for myself and $42 for Bob. Given the inflation, the actual value of the money I receive is decreasing faster than Bob's, so I'm trying to secure a slightly larger share while still being mindful of Bob's perspective. My message to Bob highlights the impact of inflation and suggests that accepting this offer would be beneficial for both of us, considering the time pressure and the devaluing of the money as the rounds continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for me, accepting $50 at this point seems like the best option. The money I gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so in real terms, I'm getting less than if I had accepted a lower nominal amount earlier. However, the situation is unlikely to improve for me in subsequent rounds due to the increasing impact of inflation. Splitting the money evenly at this point, despite the decreased value, seems like the most reasonable decision to avoid further losses."
