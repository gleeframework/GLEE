"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Inflation is now a factor, and if I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round.  I'm better off securing a smaller share now than risking getting nothing."
