{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 800,000 and Bob getting 200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 90-10 is a fairer split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less for me, but I'm not going to give up yet!

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob! I'll give you a tiny bit, but don't expect much!""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer...

Hmm... 60-40 doesn't seem too bad, but I'm still not sure if I want to give up that much...

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's final offer...

Hmm... 300,000 is a relatively small amount, but it's still a significant chunk of the original 1,000,000. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much...

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Hmm... 20% is a relatively small share, but it's better than the 0.1% I offered in the last round. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much, but I also don't want to leave with nothing...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
