Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer. I figure Bob might be willing to take a tiny amount just to avoid further rounds and the risk of getting nothing at all.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'm not thrilled with this offer, it's a significant improvement over the previous round.  I'm also concerned about the inflation rate, which means my potential gains will keep shrinking with each rejected offer. It's time to be practical and take what I can get!"
