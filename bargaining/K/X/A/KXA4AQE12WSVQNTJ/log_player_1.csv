Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch things up.  I'll take 60 this time, and you get 40. I think this is a fairer deal, considering the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
