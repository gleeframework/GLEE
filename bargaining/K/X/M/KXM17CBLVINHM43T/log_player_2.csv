Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this drags on, the less we both get. This offer is a good compromise, especially considering how much faster the inflation hits your share. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
