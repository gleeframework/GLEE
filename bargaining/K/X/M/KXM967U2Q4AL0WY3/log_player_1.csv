**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes sense due to the rapidly increasing inflation.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on the 50/50 split. He's already rejected two offers more favorable to him.  It's unlikely he'll agree to anything significantly better for Alice.

Accepting now guarantees Alice a reasonable amount, even with inflation factored in, rather than risking a complete loss."
