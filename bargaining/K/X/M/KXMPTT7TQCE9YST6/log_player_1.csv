"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I still want something! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. I'm being offered $70, which is a significant amount, but I'm being offered only $30.

Considering the 20% inflation hit that Bob will take, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to give me $70 in the previous round, I'll try to get closer to that amount while still being fair. I'll offer a slight increase to Bob's share, but not too much, since I don't want to give away too much.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 30%""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous to Bob than my initial 50/50 split, but I'm still trying to get a decent share for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now!

Considering the massive 48.8% inflation hit that Bob is taking, I'm surprised he's still offering me a decent amount. However, I'm not getting any younger, and I need to think about my own share.

Since I was offered $60 in the previous round and rejected it, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, the fact that Bob is offering me $55 now, which is a significant amount, makes me think that he's trying to make a good deal.

I'll take the money while it's still worth something!
