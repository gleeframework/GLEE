"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a quarter of the money, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think a quarter of the money is too low, considering the inflation factor. I'll make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 5% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the money, considering the inflation. I think this is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a more balanced offer given the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% of the money, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get me to accept the same offer he rejected earlier. I'll reject it again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, considering the 14.26% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 51% of the money, considering the current value. I think this is a fair split, given the situation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 49/51 split, which I think is a reasonable offer given the current value of the money."
