I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $8,000 I would gain in the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $7,200 in this round. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is better than what I could get in the next round.
