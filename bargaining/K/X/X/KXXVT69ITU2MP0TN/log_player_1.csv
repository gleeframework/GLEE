"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less to start.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $800,000 and leave $200,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm open to negotiation in the future. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: $100,000 * 0.8 = $80,000
* Bob's gain: $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, my gain will be worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob."
