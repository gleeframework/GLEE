Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to secure a decent share. This is my final offer above 600k.  Let's be realistic - the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer means I lose almost two-thirds of the potential value due to inflation. It's a gamble, but I think I can still push Alice to be more equitable.  If she's truly set on getting more than 600k, I need to offer a deal that gives her that while maximizing my rapidly shrinking share."
