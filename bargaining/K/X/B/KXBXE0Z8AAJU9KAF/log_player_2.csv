Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one! Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, and it's working. While I'd prefer a more even split, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. Accepting 43 dollars now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
