525000.0,475000.0,"Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, Bob.  I'm feeling generous, so I'll take a slightly larger share considering the inflation factor. This way we both walk away with a good amount!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the inflation factor affects you more, Alice, I believe this offer is more balanced, taking into account the value we both perceive from the money.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. Let's be practical and split it evenly. This is the fairest outcome, especially with the inflation working against me.  A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, Alice, I've adjusted my offer to reflect the changing value of the money for you. This split is more representative of the current situation.",Bob,4,

475000.0,525000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but this needs to be a fair deal for both of us. Considering the significant impact of inflation, I'm proposing a 47.5/52.5 split.  This recognizes the value difference while still providing you with a larger share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
380000.0,620000.0,"Alice, considering the substantial impact of inflation on your share, which is now worth significantly less than in the first round, I believe this adjusted offer reflects the current value disparity. It's essential to account for the decreasing value of the money for you, and this split aims to do just that.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer.  I understand the impact of inflation is increasing, but I need to secure a reasonable amount. This split acknowledges the changing value and provides us both with a decent outcome. If you decline, I'm worried we'll both walk away with nothing.",Alice,7,
