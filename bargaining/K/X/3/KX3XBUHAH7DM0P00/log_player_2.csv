**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is closer to a potential agreement, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""This is a very fair offer, Alice. Let's close the deal and avoid losing more to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to secure a deal while maximizing my share. I'm nudging my offer down slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but it's still heavily in my favor. The message emphasizes fairness and the risk of losing more due to inflation, hopefully pushing Alice to accept."
