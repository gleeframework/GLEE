"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 20% advantage, so I'll keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give up control""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping some control for myself. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll consider this offer.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 65% is a good share for me, and I'm willing to give Bob 35% to end the game."
