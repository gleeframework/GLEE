Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Alice a bit less than she offered me.  Hopefully, this will make her want to accept the offer instead of risking losing more in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering me less than what I offered her in the previous round. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, hoping that Alice will see that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also aware that the money is worth less with each round, so I need to start getting closer to a deal."
