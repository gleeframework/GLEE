"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start and avoids any risk of losing money in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob! I'll consider it. However, I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the reduced value, and Bob gets 45%. The message is a gentle nudge to get Bob to consider my perspective."
