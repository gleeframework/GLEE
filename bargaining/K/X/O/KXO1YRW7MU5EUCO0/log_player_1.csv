I propose to take 999,999 dollars, and Bob gets 1 dollar.  It's a fair offer, as I'm basically letting him have a chance to experience being a millionaire for a fleeting moment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly bigger piece this time, but I'm still taking the vast majority. After all, I am the one coming up with the offers!"

I won't accept this offer, Bob's being too greedy.  I'm going to try a different strategy in the next round."

Let's try a more even split. I'm sure we can both be happy with half a million dollars."
