"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. This way, we both get a significant amount, but I'm taking a bit more since I'm making the first offer. The message is a casual way of framing the proposal, emphasizing the fairness of the division. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more equitable split. Let's finish this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round to try to get a larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $575,000 for myself and $425,000 for Bob. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but still favors me. The message suggests finding a middle ground, which might appeal to Bob given the decreasing value of the money for him. I'm trying to find a balance between getting the most I can and making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need a better deal than this. Let's finish this round. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I don't feel the pressure of inflation that Bob does. Bob's offer is slightly better than the last one, but I believe I can push for an even more favorable deal given the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share. I'll make another offer in the next round to try to maximize my gain. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 587500, ""bob_gain"": 412500, ""message"": ""Consider the future value""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $587,500 for myself and $412,500 for Bob. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still attempts to find a balance. The message is a subtle reminder to Bob that the value of the money is decreasing for him with each round, which might motivate him to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. I'm trying to leverage the pressure of inflation on Bob's decision-making to get a more favorable deal. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. This is getting ridiculous, and we're both losing money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Although I was trying to negotiate for a better deal, the fact that Bob is now offering a 50/50 split suggests that he's getting desperate due to the increasing impact of inflation on his share. Given that the money is still worth the same to me, I've managed to avoid the devaluation that Bob has suffered. At this point, accepting the offer ensures that I get a significant amount, and further negotiations might not yield a better result. It's time to end the game and take the $500,000."
