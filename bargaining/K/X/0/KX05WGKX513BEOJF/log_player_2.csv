"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to give you a good chunk of the money.  Think about it, and let me know if you want to move forward with this. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, accepting the offer would result in Bob receiving $1000, which is only 10% of the total amount, while Alice would receive $9000, which is 90% of the total amount. Considering that the money's value decreases by 20% for Bob in each subsequent round, there's an incentive to try and negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is just the first round and there are 11 more rounds to potentially improve the offer. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round and try to secure a more favorable division of the money. \n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the initial rejection and the impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings, it's strategic to propose a division that offers a better share to Bob while still being potentially acceptable to Alice. A 60-40 split is more equitable than the initial offer, reflecting Bob's desire to find a compromise. By suggesting this division, Bob aims to negotiate a better deal before the money's value decreases further in subsequent rounds. \n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation and the fact that you rejected my initial offer.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the offer has improved from the initial $1000 to $3000 for Bob, considering the 36% decrease in value due to inflation, the actual worth of the $3000 is significantly less than its face value. Furthermore, accepting this offer would still result in Alice receiving a substantially larger share ($7000) of the money, which maintains its original value for her. Given that there are still 9 rounds left to negotiate and the potential for further compromise, rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue seeking a more equitable division that better accounts for the impact of inflation on his share. \n\n###"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my previous offer. A 55-45 split seems reasonable, given the decreasing value of my share.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: With the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings and the rejection of previous offers, it's strategic to slightly adjust the proposed division to make it more appealing to Alice while still advocating for a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. By suggesting a 55-45 split, Bob continues to seek a compromise that acknowledges the effects of inflation on his portion of the money. This approach aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob and the unchanged value for Alice. \n\n###"
