"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm offering Bob 20% of the original $100, which is $20, and keeping the remaining 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. 

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 10 / 0.8 = 12.5
Bob's gain: 90 / 0.9 = 100

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting a smaller share than in the previous round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer. 

Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 12,
  ""bob_gain"": 88
}
```
I'm offering Bob 88% of the remaining value, which is 88 / 0.9 = 97.78, and keeping 12% for myself, which is 12 / 0.8 = 15."
