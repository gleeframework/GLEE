"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one taking the risk of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept the 30% share. Given that the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. However, since Bob has already made an offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to account for inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more in my favor to account for the effects of inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering that the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, I don't want to give up too much more, especially since I've already rejected a 30% share in the previous round. I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low share anymore, I need a better deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more in my favor to account for the cumulative effects of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm firm on my numbers, but willing to give you a tiny bit more 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With the money being worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'm starting to feel the pinch.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 15% share, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I don't want to give up more than 15% of the original $100, considering the inflation. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
