"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's flip the script from last round - I'll take 600000 and you take 400000. This is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my gain accordingly.

Considering the new values, I'll decide whether to accept Bob's offer. However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually the same as my original offer, just with the labels flipped. I'm not sure if Bob is trying to trick me or if he genuinely thinks it's a fair starting point.

I'll reject the offer to keep the negotiation going.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has taken a toll on the money's value, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
