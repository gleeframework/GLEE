"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting would mean settling for a significantly smaller amount.
* **My counter-offer:** I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for me, but still offering Alice a reasonable sum. 
* **Time pressure:**  Since the money loses value with each round,  I need to incentivize Alice to accept now. My offer is a compromise between maximizing my gain and ensuring Alice accepts before inflation eats into the value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn again, don't wait for a better deal 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable offer:** Alice's offer is even worse than her first one! The inflation is hurting, but accepting this would mean losing a huge chunk of the potential gain.
* **Leverage:** Alice knows time is working against me. However, she also wants to maximize her gains. I'm betting she'll be more willing to negotiate in the next round as the deadline looms.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might not budge much, but the potential reward of a better split outweighs accepting this highly unfavorable deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out! Let's settle this now with a win-win deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in strategy:**  With significant inflation eating into my potential gains, I need to prioritize reaching an agreement.  
* **Appealing to Alice:**  My offer is now much closer to a 50/50 split, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Urgency:** My message emphasizes the time pressure, urging Alice to accept this reasonable offer before we both lose out further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  The value of the money has significantly decreased. Accepting a smaller share is now better than risking getting nothing in the final round.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Her offer is still bad, but her previous rejections and the ""generous"" comment suggest she won't offer much better. 
* **Minimizing losses:** This isn't ideal, but at this point, it's about damage control. Accepting secures a reasonable sum, even with the inflation, and avoids the risk of getting an even worse deal or nothing at all."
