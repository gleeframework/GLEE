"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, and Bob will get the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... Considering the inflation, my gain of 65 is actually worth 65 * 0.9 = 58.5, and Bob's gain of 35 is worth 35 * 0.95 = 33.25.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
