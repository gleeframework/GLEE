Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that I'm more patient, but it still gives you a significant sum right now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
