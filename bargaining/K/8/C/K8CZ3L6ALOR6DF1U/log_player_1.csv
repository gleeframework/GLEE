"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to try and get the most money possible, but I'm also going to make sure Bob gets something so that he's more likely to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting and potentially having Bob propose an even worse deal in the next round."
