"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $50. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it's easy to understand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm feeling bold 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. He's proposing a 70/30 split, which is quite lopsided. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and hope to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal this time, but don't get too comfortable!""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Ugh, Bob's offer is getting even more aggressive! I'm not going to accept an 80/20 split, that's way too lopsided. I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, but I'm not ready to give in yet. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but don't think I'm going to give in easily!""}

I'm proposing a 35/65 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offers. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might appeal to him, while still keeping some of the value for myself."
