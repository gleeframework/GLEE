It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal than 40% in the next round."

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

It's still early in the game. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm still confident I can get at least 50% of the money."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I think we can both do better than 55/45. I'm willing to offer you 45% if you accept this offer. We can avoid further rounds and both get a fair share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close!  I'm feeling generous - how about 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you?  We both win if we settle now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm confident I can get at least 50% of the money."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to offer you 47.5% now.  Let's avoid further rounds and agree on a fair split. This is the best offer you'll get before the value of your share diminishes further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're circling the same point.  This offer is just a small compromise on my end to show you I'm serious about ending this quickly.  51/49 and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target of 50%. It's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers, and with the inflation affecting Alice more, I don't think I'll get a better deal in the next round."
