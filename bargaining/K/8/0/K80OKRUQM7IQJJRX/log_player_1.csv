"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept it early on. Since I don't know how inflation affects him, it's better to get something than risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 20% inflation, accepting this offer gives me a significant amount of money.  It's better to take what I can get than risk losing everything in the remaining rounds."
