"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try a more even division. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better than a 60/40 split, huh? I'm not so sure about that. But I'll consider his offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amount he's offering me in terms of the original $100:

$60 * 0.8 = $48 (due to 20% inflation)

So, Bob is offering me $48 and keeping $52 for himself. I'll think about it...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40-60 split, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 45% share, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still leaves me with a decent 55% share. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a fair deal after all. A 50/50 split sounds reasonable, but I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get considering the inflation:

$50 * 0.512 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value is left for Bob) = $25.60

So, Bob is offering me $25.60 and keeping $74.40 for himself. It's a decent offer, but I was hoping for a bit more.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that I rejected it. I'll offer him a slightly worse deal, but I'll still get a decent amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, aren't you? I'll give you a bit less, but I'm not budging much more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 42% share, which is a bit less than his previous offer, but I'm still getting a decent 58% share. Let's see if he'll accept!"
