"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, I'll be generous""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but I'm still offering Bob a decent chunk to keep the negotiations going."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful now that the money is worth less. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

I'll make a new offer in the next round."

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and not giving up too much."
