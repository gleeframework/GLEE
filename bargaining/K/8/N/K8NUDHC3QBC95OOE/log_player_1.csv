I'm going to start with a pretty lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share early on, or if he's going to try to negotiate for more.  Since I'm the one losing more value with each round, I want to get as much as possible as early as possible!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob's offer is still pretty lopsided, and while it's closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still losing more value with each round. I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly more equitable split this round. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I still want to ensure I get a larger share.  I'm still losing more value each round, so I'm aiming for a deal that favors me while also being a bit more reasonable than my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While the inflation has taken a large bite out of the value of my potential winnings, this is the closest we've gotten to a 50/50 split.  Given that I'm losing more value with each passing round, I don't want to risk getting nothing."
