"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to be fair, but I want a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, my gain of 50 is actually 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

I'll have to think about it... Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more in his favor than my initial offer. But I'm not sure if I want to give up the extra 12.5 I had in my initial offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain is worth 5% less than 47.5, which is 47.5 * 0.95 = 45.13.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob is looking for a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to make a more aggressive move, but still keep it fair 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of 45 is actually 45 / 0.856 (1 - 0.1426) = 52.47.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's even more in Bob's favor than his previous offer. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain is worth 14.26% less than 45.13, which is 45.13 / 0.8586 (1 - 0.1426) = 52.41.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob is making more aggressive moves:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```"
