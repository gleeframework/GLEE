"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to secure the majority of the money early on. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than my previous one, but I'm still hoping for a more equitable split. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway with a slightly less aggressive offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly favorable to him, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to get a better split in the next round. The inflation is making it difficult to get the most money, but I'm determined to try!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll offer Bob 20% and keep 80% for myself.  I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob, as the inflation is starting to affect his gains more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him, I'm not going to accept yet. It's still possible to negotiate a better deal, and I'm prepared to see how the inflation plays out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 25% and keep 75% for myself.  The inflation is really starting to bite now, so I'm hoping to find a compromise before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though it's an even split, it's the best I can get at this point. The inflation has seriously reduced Bob's potential gains, making him more likely to accept a fair offer.  I'll take the 50% and hope that I can get a better deal next time."
