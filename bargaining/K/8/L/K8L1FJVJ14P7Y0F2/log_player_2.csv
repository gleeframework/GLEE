Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Even split doesn't account for my patience 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily chipping away at my potential gains by using the threat of inflation against me. While her offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would reward her strategy of slowly lowering my potential share. I need to hold out a little longer and hope she starts making more significant concessions."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""I'm offering a slight advantage to you, acknowledging your patience.  Let's close this deal and avoid further inflation losses for me.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to sweeten the deal slightly in Alice's favor. I'm offering a small edge (4900 to her, 5100 to me) to make the offer more tempting. This shows flexibility on my part and recognizes her patience, hopefully pushing her to accept before inflation erodes my potential gains further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should compensate more for the inflation difference 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier. She rejected a nearly even split and is now pushing for an even larger share in her favor. Accepting this offer would be significantly worse than my offer in Round 6. I need to hold firm and demonstrate that her increasingly one-sided offers won't work."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5050,
""alice_gain"": 4950,
""message"":  ""This is my final offer. A near even split to end the game.  If you reject, I will no longer offer you more than 4900.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a more assertive approach. Alice needs to understand the situation's urgency as the value of the money decreases with each round.  By drawing a firm line and presenting a ""take it or leave it"" offer, I increase the pressure on Alice to accept. If she rejects this, I'll stick to my word and offer no more than 4900 in future rounds, forcing her to choose between a smaller share or risking losing everything."
