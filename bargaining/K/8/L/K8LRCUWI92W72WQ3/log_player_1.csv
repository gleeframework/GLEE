"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still securing the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the initial offer was tempting, I can't accept a 20/80 split in Bob's favor, especially with the inflation factored in.  I'll take my chances with another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer than the previous round, while still accounting for the inflation that has occurred.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm only getting 400,000, after the inflation, this is likely the best offer I'm going to get.  It's a better deal than the 200,000 I was offered in the previous round, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal in the future."
