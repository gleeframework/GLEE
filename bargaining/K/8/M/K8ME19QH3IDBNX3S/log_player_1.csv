"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take 10% and I'll take the rest. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

This offer gives Bob $100,000 and me $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the majority, but you'll get a chance to renegotiate later.  This is about being smart, not greedy! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob is being smart or just greedy, but I'm not willing to give him 90% of the money just yet. I'd like to see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being reasonable, but I'm not giving up yet! Take 30% and I'll take the rest.""
}
```"
