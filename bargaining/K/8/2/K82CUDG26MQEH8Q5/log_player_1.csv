"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable split!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair and reasonable split, considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, let me think...

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
