"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'll receive are:

* My gain: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600
* Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400

Not a bad offer, but I can try to do better. I'll reject this offer.

  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% and leave 45% for Bob."
