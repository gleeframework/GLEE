Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth 95% of the original $200,000, which is $190,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 80% of the original $800,000, which is $640,000.

I'll reject this offer. The majority share is too skewed towards Bob, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.
