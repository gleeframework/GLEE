I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. I'll take most of the money but it seems like a good starting point. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob is being very greedy! I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll make a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share, but still a decent amount, hoping he'll see that we need to come to an agreement soon or we'll both lose a lot of money due to inflation."
