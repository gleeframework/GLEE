"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to account for inflation over the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I'm not sure I want to be stuck with 4000 dollars while Alice gets 6000. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split.  Let's both get a decent amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing money in the later rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The deal has to be better for me in the earlier rounds, Bob. This accounts for the inflation effect. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation risk is starting to weigh heavily. If I reject this offer, the money Alice receives in the next round will be even less, making it even harder to reach a deal.  It's better to take the 4500 now and avoid further risk."
