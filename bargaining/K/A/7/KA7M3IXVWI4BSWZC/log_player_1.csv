"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's still a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. I'd rather not accept an offer that's even less favorable than the first one. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think this is a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think this is still a good balance. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! My gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round. I'll think carefully about this offer. Bob's offer is still not as favorable as my initial offer, but it's better than the second offer. I'll accept this one to move forward.
