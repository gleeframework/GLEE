Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split to ensure fairness and maximize our collective wealth given the diminishing value of money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
