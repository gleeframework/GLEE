**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go on and her potential payout decreases. While her offer is closer to the middle, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds.  It's a risk, but the potential reward of securing a larger share is worth it at this stage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 505000, ""alice_gain"": 495000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a very fair offer considering the time constraint and the decreasing value. Let's close the deal and both walk away with something substantial.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing a bit closer to the middle ground to incentivize Alice while still aiming for a slight advantage.  Highlighting the decreasing value and the urgency of the situation should make this offer appealing to her."
