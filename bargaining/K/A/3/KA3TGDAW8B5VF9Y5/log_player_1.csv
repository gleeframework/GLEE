Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 1,000,000$ into 600,000$ for me and 400,000$ for you. It's a fair deal!""
}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 420,000 and leave you with 580,000. It's a fair split, considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
