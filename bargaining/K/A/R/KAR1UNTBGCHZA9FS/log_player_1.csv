"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, with the message that I'm starting with a fair split and we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I'm willing to give you a small share to start, but I'm hoping we can negotiate a more equitable split in the coming rounds. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since I need to make progress and the value of my share is decreasing with each round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
