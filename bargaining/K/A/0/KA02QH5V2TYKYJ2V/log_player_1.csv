"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 30
