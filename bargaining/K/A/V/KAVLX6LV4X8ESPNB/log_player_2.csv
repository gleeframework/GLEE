Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm standing firm.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough spot.  Alice is clearly playing hardball. Accepting means a much smaller gain than I wanted, but rejecting means risking getting even less next round due to inflation. It's better to take the guaranteed $3000 now than risk getting an even worse offer."
