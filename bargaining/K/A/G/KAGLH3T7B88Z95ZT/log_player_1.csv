I'm starting with a very strong offer in favor of myself.  While it's unlikely Bob will accept it in the first round, I'm trying to set the tone for the negotiation.  I'm hoping to maximize my share early on, before the inflation starts to bite.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous one, but it's still not ideal.  While I'm losing out on a substantial amount of money, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. I know that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I'll use that to my advantage.  Let's see what I can do!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly from my first offer, while still offering a significant amount to Bob. I'm hoping that this will be more enticing than his previous offer. I'm also taking into account the fact that the inflation is starting to affect Bob, which might make him more inclined to accept a deal now rather than risk getting even less later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is improving, but it's still not enough to make me happy.  I know the inflation is hitting him harder than me, and I'm going to try to push for a bigger share in the next round.  He's getting desperate, but I'm not going to give in yet.  Let's see if I can force him to accept a deal more favorable to me!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm raising my share again, but I'm still offering Bob a decent amount.  The inflation is definitely taking its toll on him, and I'm confident that he'll be more likely to accept this offer than the previous ones.  I'm trying to find that sweet spot where I maximize my gains while still giving him enough incentive to agree. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I know the inflation is hitting him hard, and he's getting desperate for a deal.  I'm going to hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get him to offer me an even bigger share.  I'm confident that I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm pushing my luck a bit here, but Bob is definitely feeling the pressure of inflation.  I'm offering him a very small share, but I'm still giving him something.  I'm hoping that he'll accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's see if I can finally get him to agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me considering how quickly the inflation is devaluing Bob's gains.  I'm not getting my ideal share, but it's a significant amount of money, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all.  I'm accepting!"
