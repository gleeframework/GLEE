"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair split. Since Bob's value for the money decreases by 10% each round, he might be inclined to accept a slightly less favorable offer early on rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. This initial offer tests Bob's willingness to negotiate while also attempting to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a more fair split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob considers this a more fair split due to inflation, accepting $4500 is less than my initial gain of $6000. Since my value for the money doesn't decrease with each round, I can afford to hold out for a better offer or try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round. Rejecting also gives me the opportunity to propose again, potentially leveraging Bob's decreasing value for the money to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself, adjusting my initial offer slightly to acknowledge the impact of inflation on Bob's valuation but still aiming to maximize my gain. The message frames this as a reasonable adjustment, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise but also recognizing the decreasing value of the money to Bob. This offer tests Bob's patience and willingness to continue negotiating as the value of the money he could gain continues to decrease."
