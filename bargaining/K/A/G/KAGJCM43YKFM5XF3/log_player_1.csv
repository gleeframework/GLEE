"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll get $4000 instead of $5000, which is a 20% decrease.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $4000 and we can proceed to the next round."
