"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, my offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

This way, I'll get 65% of the remaining value, and Bob will get 35%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain in round 1 was 80, and it's worth 14.26% less now, so my gain in round 4 would be 80 * 0.8582 = 68.656.
Bob's gain in round 1 was 20, and it's worth 27.1% less now, so Bob's gain in round 4 would be 20 * 0.7269 = 14.538.

Considering these values, I'll make my decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
