"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 95% of $40, which is $38. But Bob's gain of $60 is now worth 80% of $60, which is $48.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd rather have $38 than $48, but I'm not sure if I should wait for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. My gain of $38 is now worth 95% of $38, which is $36.20. Bob's gain of $48 is now worth 80% of $48, which is $38.40.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value."
