"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I do think 20 dollars is a bit low.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40-60""}

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate too. However, I'm not willing to give up yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another proposal that's a bit more aggressive. I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 (again!)""}

I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as it's a more equal split."
