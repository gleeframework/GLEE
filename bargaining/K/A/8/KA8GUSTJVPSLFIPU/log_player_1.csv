"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! Don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money, $900,000, for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to give Bob such a big chunk of the money. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on my gains, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not going to give you a free pass to the majority of the money. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm keeping a larger share of the money, $700,000, and offering Bob $300,000. It's a tough but fair offer, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 40/60, but this is my final offer. If you reject it, we both risk losing even more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to make a final offer, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. The inflation is taking a significant toll on my gains, but I'm not ready to settle for 40% yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not budging on the majority of the money. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm keeping a larger share of the money, $600,000, and offering Bob $400,000. It's a tough offer, but I'm trying to stay ahead of the inflation curve."
