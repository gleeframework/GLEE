"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is:

$2000 * 0.9 = $1800

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
