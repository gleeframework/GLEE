"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less, I need to be more aggressive in my demands. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
