"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to propose next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a better deal. Even though Alice is taking the lion's share, there's still room for improvement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering you get a much bigger discount on each round. This will allow us to both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic. My discount is much steeper, so I'm willing to give up a bit more. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the declining value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option. The money is losing value rapidly, especially for Alice. It's likely she'll be less willing to compromise in the next rounds."
