Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering you get a much bigger discount on each round. This will allow us to both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000
