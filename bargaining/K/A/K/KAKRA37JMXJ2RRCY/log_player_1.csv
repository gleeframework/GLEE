"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, I still want to maximize my gain.

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still trying to keep a significant portion of the money for myself."
