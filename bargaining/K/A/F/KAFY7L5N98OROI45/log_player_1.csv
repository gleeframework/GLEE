"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This is a pretty straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll think about how much I'm willing to give up to get a good deal.

I'll reject the offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```"
