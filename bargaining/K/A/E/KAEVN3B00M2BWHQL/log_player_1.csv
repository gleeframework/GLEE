"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $100,000 is now worth $90,000, which is a significant decrease. Considering the substantial difference in the amounts, I'll decide to reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so my gain of $600,000 (80% of $750,000, which is 10% less than $800,000) is now worth $480,000.

Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
