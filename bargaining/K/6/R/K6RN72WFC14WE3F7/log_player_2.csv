Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take the deal before inflation eats your share!

I'll explain my reasoning:

In Round 5, due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. This means that the $3700 offered by Alice is equivalent to approximately $1515 in the first round's value.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round, where the value of the money could drop even further.

Additionally, Alice's message suggests that she's getting frustrated and might not be willing to offer a better deal in the next round. So, I'll take the $3700 and end the game here."
