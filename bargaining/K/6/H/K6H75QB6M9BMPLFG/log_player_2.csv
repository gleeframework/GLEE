"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice, reflecting a fair distribution considering the risk and potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal might seem fair on the surface, it's important to consider the potential impact of inflation. Since each round decreases the value of the money by 10%, rejecting the offer and making a counter-proposal in the next round could be advantageous.  The goal is to get a better split for Bob, even if it means delaying the final outcome."
