"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I want most of the money. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money loses 5% of its value each round for Bob, but not for Alice, Bob should try to delay the agreement to get a better offer from Alice. Additionally, Alice's initial offer is quite uneven, with Bob only getting 10% of the total amount. By rejecting this offer, Bob puts pressure on Alice to reconsider and possibly make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation!""}\n\nReasoning: Given that the money loses 5% of its value each round for Bob, it's in his interest to try to reach an agreement relatively quickly. However, he also wants a fair share. By offering a 60-40 split, Bob is making a more generous offer to Alice than she initially made to him, while also taking into account the fact that further rounds will devalue his potential gain. The message aims to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and the mutual benefit of avoiding further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make this worth it. Let's get closer to a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although Alice has made a more generous offer than her initial one, the 40-60 split still doesn't fully account for the devaluation of the money Bob will receive due to inflation. Since Bob offered a 60-40 split in his favor in the previous round and Alice rejected it, Bob may believe he can still negotiate for a better deal. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean Bob gets $4000, which is worth less than its face value due to inflation. By rejecting, Bob continues to pressure Alice for a more favorable split, hoping the risk of losing everything after 12 rounds will prompt her to offer more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise. We're running out of time!""}\n\nReasoning: At this point, Bob has to balance the urgency of reaching a deal with the need to account for the increasing devaluation of his share due to inflation. By slightly reducing his proposed share from 60% to 58%, Bob is showing willingness to compromise while still aiming to offset the loss in value. The message emphasizes the pressure of time and the fairness of the offer, aiming to persuade Alice that this is a reasonable compromise, especially considering the risk of both getting nothing if they fail to agree within the 12 rounds."
