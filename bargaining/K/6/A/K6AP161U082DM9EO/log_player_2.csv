"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to leave you a little something.  Consider it an investment in our future partnership. ðŸ˜Š 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer. While I understand the game's mechanics and Alice's desire to get the majority, taking almost everything while offering only $1000 is not a good starting point for a partnership. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can always adjust later, but I believe a 50/50 split is the most equitable way to begin.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this.  I'm still willing to split the money, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  Let's be realistic and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still significantly lopsided in her favor.  While she's acknowledging the pressure of inflation, it seems she's trying to use it to her advantage. I'm willing to be flexible, but I won't accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share. Let's see if we can find a more equitable solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split. This offer reflects the reality of the inflation, but also allows for a fair distribution.  What do you think?""
