"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $60 is still worth $60, but Bob's gain of $40 is now worth $32.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer for Round 2. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
