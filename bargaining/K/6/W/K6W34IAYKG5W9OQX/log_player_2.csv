"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It seems unfair to me, and I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way, and we both get a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. I'm offering you a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, considering the inflation and the potential for losing more in the next round, I'll accept Alice's offer."
