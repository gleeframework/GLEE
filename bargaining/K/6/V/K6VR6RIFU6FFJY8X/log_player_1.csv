Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm going to start by taking the lion's share, but leaving Bob with a little something to hopefully keep him interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept such a meager offer!  Bob is being greedy, but I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still going to take the majority of the money, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to see if I can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous!  Bob is being incredibly stubborn. I'm not going to accept his offer again, and I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm lowering my share again, but Bob needs to realize this is getting closer to the end. He needs to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still ridiculously unfair. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers until he starts getting serious about negotiation.  This game is running out of time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a more even split this time, but I'm running out of time. I'm hoping Bob will see that we need to come to an agreement quickly."
