"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't be serious with an even split, I'm the one who's going to have to deal with the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's unfair that he's trying to take a larger share of the money, especially since I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'll keep negotiating to try to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split considering the inflation rate.""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount, considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think 55-45 is fair? I think 57-43 is more reasonable, considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gains! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting more aggressive!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because I think 57-43 is still too skewed in his favor. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much more. I'll try to make another offer that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 52-48 is a fairer split considering the inflation rate and our previous negotiations.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keep some buffer for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough. I think 54-46 is the bare minimum I'll accept, considering the inflation is starting to take a big bite out of my potential earnings! 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting more desperate!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because I think 54-46 is still too skewed in his favor. I'm starting to get concerned about the inflation rate and the value of the money, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll try to make another offer that's more balanced.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation and I need to be more cautious."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to revisit the even split, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing this because I think it's the fairest way to divide the money, considering the inflation rate and our previous negotiations.""}

I'm going back to my initial proposal of an even split, but this time I'm being more explicit about my reasoning. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is the fairest solution and accept it."
