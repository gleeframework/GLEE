I'll start by taking the lion's share.  I'm offering you $10,000. Let's see if you're happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
