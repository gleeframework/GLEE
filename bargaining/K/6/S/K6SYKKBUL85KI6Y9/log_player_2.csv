"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me to account for inflation in later rounds. This way we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal. 12 rounds is a lot of time, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly this time. I'm sure we can both agree that a fair split is the best way to start.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we both lose if we don't agree. I'm proposing a split that accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4512 
# Alice gain: 5488 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to try to get a better deal. Alice's offer is getting worse with each round, and I'm hoping she'll realize that it's in her best interest to settle for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle and split the money more evenly.  I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to acknowledge the inflation, but I'm sure we can find a better compromise than your last offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You need to acknowledge that the money is losing value quickly for me. I'm proposing a split that reflects this, but still leaves you with a significant amount. Let's be practical and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4270 
# Alice gain: 5730 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm still holding out for a more equitable split. I believe we can reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to offer you a slightly smaller share than before to account for the inflation, but I think we can both agree that this is a more fair solution than your previous offers. Let's end this and get the money before we both lose everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're down to the wire here! I'm making a final offer. This reflects the lost value due to inflation. If you reject this, I'm accepting that we'll both walk away with nothing, because I won't accept a deal that doesn't acknowledge the reality of the situation. 
# Bob gain: 4031 
# Alice gain: 5969 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is right that time is running out, I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided split. The value of the money is decreasing for both of us, and I think we can still find a more equitable solution before the clock runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both on the edge now. I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but it's the best I can do while still acknowledging the inflation. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both walk away empty-handed. Let's be reasonable and end this before it's too late.""}
