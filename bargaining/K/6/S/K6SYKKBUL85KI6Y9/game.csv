5488.0,4512.0,"Bob, time is running out and we both lose if we don't agree. I'm proposing a split that accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,3,

4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle and split the money more evenly.  I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to acknowledge the inflation, but I'm sure we can find a better compromise than your last offer.",Bob,4,

5730.0,4270.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You need to acknowledge that the money is losing value quickly for me. I'm proposing a split that reflects this, but still leaves you with a significant amount. Let's be practical and end this.",Alice,5,

I'm willing to offer you a slightly smaller share than before to account for the inflation, but I think we can both agree that this is a more fair solution than your previous offers. Let's end this and get the money before we both lose everything.",Bob,6,

4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, we're both on the edge now. I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but it's the best I can do while still acknowledging the inflation. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both walk away empty-handed. Let's be reasonable and end this before it's too late.",Bob,8,
