Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. I'm sure we can both agree that a fair split is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5488,
""bob_gain"": 4512,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and we both lose if we don't agree. I'm proposing a split that accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle and split the money more evenly.  I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to acknowledge the inflation, but I'm sure we can find a better compromise than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting to acknowledge the inflation, but his offer is still not good enough.  We're running out of time, but accepting a deal heavily in his favor would be a mistake. It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to a 55/45 split to properly account for the shrinking pot from Alice's perspective."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5730,
""bob_gain"": 4270,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You need to acknowledge that the money is losing value quickly for me. I'm proposing a split that reflects this, but still leaves you with a significant amount. Let's be practical and end this.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to offer you a slightly smaller share than before to account for the inflation, but I think we can both agree that this is a more fair solution than your previous offers. Let's end this and get the money before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to pressure me with the time limit and while his offer is slightly better than before, it's still not reflective of the actual decreasing value.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm willing to hold out for a bit longer, even if it means risking a less favorable outcome, in the hopes he'll propose something closer to a 55/45 split soon."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5969,
""bob_gain"": 4031,
""message"": ""Bob, we're down to the wire here! I'm making a final offer. This reflects the lost value due to inflation. If you reject this, I'm accepting that we'll both walk away with nothing, because I won't accept a deal that doesn't acknowledge the reality of the situation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both on the edge now. I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but it's the best I can do while still acknowledging the inflation. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both walk away empty-handed. Let's be reasonable and end this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time pressure is immense now. While Bob's offer is still not ideal, it's better than nothing, which is what we're both headed for if this continues. Accepting this now avoids the risk of getting even less or walking away with nothing in the final rounds."
