"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, I'll take a bit more but we both win""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a compromise where I take a bit more but we both end up winning something. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good deal this way! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, it might seem fair, but considering the inflation effect where Bob's share will be worth 5% less, I can potentially get a better deal if I wait. Therefore, I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation effect on Bob's share. Since his money is worth 5% less with each passing round, I might be able to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable for Bob to accept.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6100, ""bob_gain"": 3900, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split now.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this adjusted offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This split gives you a decent share while still accounting for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob is offering a 55/45 split in my favor, trying to compromise. However, considering the increasing effect of inflation on Bob's share (now 14.26% less valuable than in the first round), and my goal to maximize my gain, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next rounds. Therefore, I'll reject this offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","As the game progresses, the effect of inflation on Bob's share becomes more pronounced, making each dollar he receives less valuable compared to mine. In this round, I'll adjust my offer slightly, aiming to capture a bit more value while still presenting it as a reasonable compromise to Bob. The message will emphasize the fairness of the split given the current state of inflation, hoping to persuade Bob that this is a good deal considering the circumstances.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Given the current inflation, this split is more than fair for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation. Let's end this and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob offers a 60/40 split in my favor, which is the same offer I made in the first round. Given that the money Bob gains is now worth 22.62% less than in the first round due to inflation, and I haven't suffered any loss in value, this deal looks more favorable to me now than it did initially. Since Bob is showing a willingness to accept a smaller share to conclude the game, and considering the risk of pushing too far and ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I'll accept this offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here!"
