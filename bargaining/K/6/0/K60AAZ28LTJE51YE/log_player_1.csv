"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds of inflation. This offer gives us both a good deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** Starting with a slightly advantageous but reasonable offer can encourage Bob to accept. A 52.5% / 47.5% split seems fair considering Alice is impacted by inflation more.
* **Inflation Factor:**  It's important to factor in inflation early on. While the difference seems small in the first round, it compounds quickly. Getting Bob to agree now is better than a potentially larger share later when the money is worth less.
* **Message:**  A message that emphasizes fairness and mutually beneficial outcomes can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was generous, but inflation hurts us both. Let's settle this quickly with a slight adjustment in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is tempting because it ends the game, but it's ultimately not in Alice's best interest. Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob only slightly adjusted the offer in his favor. While Alice loses an additional 10% of her potential gain due to inflation this round, Bob is only absorbing a 5% loss. 
* **Negotiating Power:** Alice is still in a relatively strong position. Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that she's serious about getting a better deal and won't be pressured by a small adjustment.
* **Future Rounds:**  While further inflation isn't ideal, Alice's faster rate of devaluation puts pressure on Bob to make a more significant move in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. It's a fair deal that saves us both from further losses.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By offering a 50/50 split, Alice demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a fair outcome. This is a significant move from her previous offer.
* **Inflation Pressure:** Even though Alice rejected Bob's offer, the clock is ticking. A 50/50 split now is likely better than a slightly advantageous offer in later rounds after further inflation.
* **Simple and Clear:**  A straightforward offer, coupled with a message emphasizing fairness and urgency, increases the chances of Bob accepting and ending the game."
