**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate. While this offer is closer to the middle, it's still significantly skewed in her favor.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, or she'll keep lowballing me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about not accepting anything less than what's fair. The ""take it or leave it"" message emphasizes that I'm willing to walk away if she rejects this.  The increasing inflation means we're both losing money every round, so a firm stance now is essential."
