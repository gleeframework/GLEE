"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to start, to see if he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 5000$ is now worth 4,750$.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.
