"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'm willing to give you a decent share. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the 20% inflation that will occur in each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $6,000 is now worth less than the $8,000 I proposed in the first round, but still a decent amount. I'll consider Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
