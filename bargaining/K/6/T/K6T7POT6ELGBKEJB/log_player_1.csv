"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to share fairly, but the value decreases faster for you than for me. This offer accounts for that. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer split.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI've already sent my new proposal in the previous response:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer split.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  It accounts for inflation and is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. The decreasing value of the money due to inflation has reduced the total value significantly, and further rounds would only decrease it more. This offer seems like a reasonable compromise at this stage."
