{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a good starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation factor."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me taking the larger share since I'm facing inflation. Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is being more generous, I'm still not happy with the 5800-4200 split, especially given the substantial inflation I'm experiencing.  I'm going to see if I can push for an even more favorable deal in the next round."

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference this time. I'm willing to settle for 5500, but it's important that we come to an agreement soon. Inflation is hurting my side of the bargain, and we're losing money with each passing round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my revised offer. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is acknowledging inflation, the offer still feels unfair. I'm going to try to hold out for a better split, especially with the ongoing inflation."
