"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of negotiating with you! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'm now looking at $5400 for my share. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he's looking at $4750.

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to negotiate a more equal split, but he's still trying to get a slightly better deal. I'm not sure if I want to give him an even split, but I'm willing to compromise.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one to make the initial offer. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'm now looking at $4860 for my share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating with you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on my share, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. You're not taking as much risk as you think you are! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'm now looking at $3690 for my share. Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, so he's looking at $4330.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I was hoping for a better deal. However, I'm starting to realize that Bob is not budging on his share, and I don't want to continue negotiating indefinitely.

I'll reject this offer and think about my next move.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept this offer. I think I deserve a better deal, but I'm not sure if I want to keep negotiating. What's your next move, Bob?""
}
```"
