Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a significant share. I want to see if he's willing to accept this early in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation makes it more likely that I'll get nothing if I reject. Accepting this 50/50 split guarantees me a substantial amount of money."
