"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a relatively fair starting point, considering that we both want to maximize our gains. I'm also including a friendly message to set a positive tone for the game. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split. Let's be reasonable and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to take that into account when considering Bob's offer. The original $100 is now worth $90 to me, so a 45-55 split means I'd get $40.50 in value. Given the decreasing value of the money, I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round to try to get a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I rejected his offer. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less to me than it was in the first round (10% less in each of the two rounds that have passed). Considering this, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me to compensate for the loss in value. I'll propose a 58-42 split in my favor.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 58-42 is a more reasonable split now.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 60-40. This is my final offer, considering the inflation on your side. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less to me, I have to think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the original $100 is now worth approximately $72.90 to me, a 40-60 split means I'd get $29.16 in value. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, Bob claims this is his final offer, and I risk getting an even worse deal if I reject it and the game continues.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get considering the inflation and Bob's unwillingness to budge further.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've accepted his offer. The game is over."
