"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $45 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best option, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

```

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting now. My gain of $40 is worth only $29.30 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
