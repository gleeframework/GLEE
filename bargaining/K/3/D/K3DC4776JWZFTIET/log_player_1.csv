"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
