"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""My turn to propose a fairer split.  Let's end this quickly and avoid inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting, I signal I'm not willing to accept such a low amount.
* **My counter-offer:** This offer is still slightly in my favor, but closer to a 50/50 split. 
* **Time pressure:** The message emphasizes the need to settle quickly due to inflation, subtly pushing Alice towards accepting a deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value quickly. Waiting longer means getting a smaller slice of a shrinking pie.
* **Improved Offer:** Alice has moved closer to the middle ground, even if it's not a perfectly even split. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round isn't worth the risk of losing another 20% to inflation."
