  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my offer and we can split the money fairly!""

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to see if I can get an even better deal.
