"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair first offer, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more, my gains are already depreciated by 20%. Accepting this offer guarantees me $6,000, which is better than the risk of further inflation and a potential worse offer in the next round."
