"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose a 990,000 - 10,000 split in my favor. Since I'm going first, I want to secure a large portion of the money while still leaving Bob a small incentive to accept. I'm hoping this will encourage him to agree and avoid the risk of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. Due to inflation, my 990,000 offer would be worth only 940,500 now.  Taking Bob's offer of 50,000 is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal in the next round."
