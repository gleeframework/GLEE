"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted amounts. In this round, I would get $6000, which is worth 80% of the original $6000, but since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll get 80% of 80% of $6000, which is $3840.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 40% of its original value. To make a reasonable offer, I'll aim to get at least 50% of the remaining value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted amounts considering the inflation. The money I gain is worth 51.2% of the original $4500, which is $2304. 

I'll accept this offer.
