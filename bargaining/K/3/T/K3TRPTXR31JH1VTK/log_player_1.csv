"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 90% of the initial amount, leaving you with 10%. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 900,000$ and Bob will get 100,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the amount evenly, acknowledging the risk of inflation. This ensures fairness for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll get 550,000 * 0.95 = 522,500$ and Bob will get 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000$. 

I accept the offer.
