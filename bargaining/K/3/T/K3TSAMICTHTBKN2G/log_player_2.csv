"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. Hope you agree! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it more evenly, but I'll need a little more to compensate for the inflation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We both lose money with each round, so let's make it fair. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing. Even though the inflation is taking a bite out of the money, a guaranteed 5000 is better than a chance at a higher amount that might not materialize."
