Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While ideally, I'd want more, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action for maximizing what I gain before it diminishes further.
