"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%. The message is a friendly one, trying to entice Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get a better deal, I'm willing to give you a decent share! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 10% less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems quite generous, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my share is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and Bob's share is worth 20% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer, trying to balance the risk and reward.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This is a fair offer, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a better balance. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 27.1% less than the initial amount, and Bob's share is worth 48.8% less. This is a significant decrease in value.

Considering Bob's previous offer, this new offer is quite similar, with Bob gaining a bit more than me. I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, but I'll have to decide.

I'll accept the offer, hoping that it's a fair compromise given the circumstances.
