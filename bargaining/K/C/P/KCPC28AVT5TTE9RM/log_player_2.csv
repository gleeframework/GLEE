"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it almost evenly, but I need a little more to make up for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the deal is still not favorable to me considering the inflation.  I need to aim for a larger share in the upcoming rounds to make up for the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice!  This is a serious offer, take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. I'm increasing my demand slightly to account for the inflation, but also making it clear that I'm serious about getting a deal done soon. A slightly intimidating message might push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with every round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  The inflation is eating into the potential gains significantly with each passing round.  It's better to take a guaranteed, though diminished, amount now than risk getting even less later, or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
