"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% share for myself and a 10% share for Bob. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want more for myself. Let's see if you can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to keep at least 50% of the remaining amount. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and give me a more equal share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'll give you 45% and take 55%. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and Bob's offers are getting more aggressive!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about giving up 52% of the remaining amount. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to keep at least 50% of the remaining amount. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and give me a more equal share, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
