"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm sure we can find a more equitable solution.  Let's split it 90/10, in my favor of course! ðŸ˜‰""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but this is my final offer.  Let's not keep playing this game. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's getting riskier with each round.  Let's take the 200,000!"
