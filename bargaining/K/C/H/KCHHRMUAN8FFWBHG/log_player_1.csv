"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60% of the initial $100 and Bob 40%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, and see if we can make a deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best deal for me, especially considering the inflation. Since Bob's money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me a slightly larger share than Bob. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to him, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55/45 is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with a 55-45 split, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money.""}

I'm proposing a 58-42 split, giving me a slightly larger share than Bob. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to him, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 42, considering the inflation has affected us both 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with a 42-58 split, especially considering the significant reduction in the value of the money due to inflation. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the difference, considering the inflation has affected us both equally.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the current state of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
