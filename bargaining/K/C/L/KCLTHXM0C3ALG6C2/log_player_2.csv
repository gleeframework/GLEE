"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  We can adjust later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation rate per round doesn't significantly impact my decision at this stage, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a little more than 50%.  Let's try this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nGiven the inflation, my gain of $4500 in round 3 is actually worth less than the initial $4000 offered in round 1. I'll reject this offer in hopes of negotiating a better deal in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise but need a slightly better split.""}"
