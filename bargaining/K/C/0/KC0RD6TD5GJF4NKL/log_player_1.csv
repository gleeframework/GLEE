  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes from here?""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3800 in real value.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide to reject it:

```
{
