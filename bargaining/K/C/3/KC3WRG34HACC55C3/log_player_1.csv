"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. We both get a decent amount, and it avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
