"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to start with, but it's a decent enough offer to see if he'll accept. I'm hoping to get a larger share for myself, but I'm also trying to gauge how much he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and even though the money is worth less, I'm not going to accept this.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my share again, but not by too much. I'm hoping to find a compromise where we can both get a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less now, Bob's offer is still better than what I'd likely get if I reject and then have to make a counter offer. It's a decent amount for me and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we keep going."
