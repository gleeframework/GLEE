"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and allows us both to benefit from this game. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is reasonable, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm going to propose a slightly different split this time. Let's both see if we can agree on a deal that works for us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's not quite what I had in mind.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. This offer still gives you a good share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would like more, it's better to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds due to inflation."
