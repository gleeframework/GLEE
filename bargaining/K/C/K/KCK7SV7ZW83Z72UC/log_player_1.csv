"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good split""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I think this is a reasonable split, considering the money is worth more to me in each subsequent round. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is fairer, considering the upcoming inflation 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Although the money is worth less to me in this round, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more significantly. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 70-30 is a good compromise""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $300,000 and I'll take $700,000. Given the inflation, I believe this is a reasonable split. The money is worth less to both of us, but Bob is affected more. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
