Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very greedy strategy. I'll take almost everything and give Bob the bare minimum.  Since inflation is in play, and I don't know how it affects him, I want to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and the inflation doesn't seem to be significantly affecting my side of the deal. I'll accept."
