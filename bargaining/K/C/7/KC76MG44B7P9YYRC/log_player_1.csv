Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this early. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the initial amount.

In this case, I'd rather not accept a 50/50 split, as I could have gotten 8000 in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 3

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""You rejected my initial offer, so I'll try to adjust for inflation. This is a slightly better deal for me, but I'm willing to compromise.""

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, I need to be more cautious and aim for a higher share to maintain my purchasing power. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

However, I'm not convinced that 5500 is enough, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing rapidly, I need to be cautious and consider the long-term implications of my decision. While 6000 is a decent offer, I'm not convinced that it's the best I can get, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
