"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new proposal.

Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.95 = 427,500
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.95 = 522,500

I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, giving me $420,000 and Bob $580,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 14.26% inflation:

Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.8547 (1 - 0.1453) = 342,188
Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.8547 = 513,420

I'll think about it for a moment...

}
```

I'm proposing a 38/62 split, giving me $380,000 and Bob $620,000. The message is a firm but friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game!"
