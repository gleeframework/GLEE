I'm starting with a fair offer, 50-50, to see if Bob accepts."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob is trying to take more money, I'll have to consider the inflation factor. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth the same as $40 in the first round, but Bob will get $60, which is worth 5% less than $60 in the first round, or $57.

I'll reject this offer, since I can get more value out of the money in the long run.
