"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer in the first round to avoid potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly less than what I was originally aiming for.  I believe I can get a better deal if I reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This offer is still significantly better for me than Bob's offer in the previous round, as I have lost 5% of my money due to inflation. It also offers Bob a reasonable share, considering his money depreciated by 20% in this round. This should be attractive enough for him to accept."
