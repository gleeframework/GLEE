"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, and I'm suggesting we divide the money evenly between us. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, especially considering the inflation that's affecting Bob's gain. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 620000 
# Bob gain: 380000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to see that Bob is willing to give me a bit more each round. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept the offer. I'll take the 620,000$."
