"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of the money. However, I'm not thrilled about the huge disparity in the split. I was hoping for a more equal distribution.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a slightly more unequal split, but still trying to be fair. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping it's more acceptable to him than the previous offer."
