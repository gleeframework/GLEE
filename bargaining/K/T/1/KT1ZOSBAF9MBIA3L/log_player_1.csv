Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's be reasonable. I'll take $45, you take $55.  Time is money, and it's ticking away for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. Let's stop wasting time. I'll meet you in the middle â€“ $40 for me, $60 for you.  Take it before inflation eats away at your share too! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a tough one! While ideally, I'd like a better share, Bob is right about time being a factor. Accepting his offer now guarantees a reasonable amount, even with the inflation already incurred. Rejecting it risks even less favorable offers from him in the following rounds as the value diminishes faster for him."
