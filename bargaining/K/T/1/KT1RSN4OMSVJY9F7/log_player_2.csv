"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This is a fair split considering the risk of inflation and the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still quite uneven. With 12 rounds to go, there's a significant chance of getting a better deal.  It's worth risking a few rounds to see if a more favorable split is possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
