"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 90% and leave you with 10% this time. If you accept, we both get something. If not, we'll keep going, but the money will shrink for me with every round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""That wasn't a fair offer Alice. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This accounts for the decreasing value of the money for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is still too much in your favor. How about 40/60?  It's still a significant loss for me, but it shows I'm willing to work with you. Remember, each round we don't agree, the money shrinks for me, not you. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
