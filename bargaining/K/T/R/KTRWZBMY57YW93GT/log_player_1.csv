"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That wasn't a fair offer Alice. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This accounts for the decreasing value of the money for you. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
