"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount considering the inflation factor. Now it's up to Bob to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a fair share, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed a fair one, considering the changing values due to inflation. I'll accept his proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
