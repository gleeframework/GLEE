"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. We both get a good amount, and we avoid losing value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a decent amount, and I'll take $6,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer and we can both walk away with a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect us differently.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
