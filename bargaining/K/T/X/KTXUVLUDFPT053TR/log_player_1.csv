{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 20% is a small share, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than half of what I proposed initially. I'd like to make a new offer and try to get a better deal."
