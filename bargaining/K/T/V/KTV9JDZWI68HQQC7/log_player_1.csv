"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer is designed to be fair while giving me a significant advantage. It's likely Bob will reject it, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is unacceptable. I'll need to try and get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer is still quite generous to Bob, but it reflects the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation. I'm hoping he'll see the value in taking this offer before it gets even worse for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

The inflation is really biting now, but I'm still trying to offer Bob a reasonable share. I need to keep trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share. I need to try and negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking value, but I'm still pushing for a better share. This is my final attempt to secure a reasonable amount before things get worse."
