"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'm coming back with a stronger offer! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 250,000$ is now equivalent to 200,000$ in the first round.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You're being aggressive, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 550,000$ and keeping 450,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

Let me calculate the equivalent value of my potential gain in the first round... 

If my gain of 200,000$ in the 4th round is 51.2% of the original value, then the original value is 200,000 / 0.512 = 390,625$.

So, I'll think about it...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
