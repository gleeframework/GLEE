Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers, 56-44 is the best I can do 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better share, especially as we're approaching the halfway point of the rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice!  I'm willing to be generous, but this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to emphasize that time is running out and we risk getting nothing.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm lowering my ask slightly to 51-49, showing a willingness to compromise, but making it clear this is a final offer.
* **Psychological Pressure:** By stating it's my ""final offer,""  I'm hoping to nudge Alice into accepting before the deal potentially gets worse for her."
