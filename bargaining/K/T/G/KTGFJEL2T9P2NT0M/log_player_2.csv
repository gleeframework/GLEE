"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Besides, 5000 is a decent amount, but I think I can do better. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since I'm taking the risk of inflation in the next rounds.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses 10% of its value with each passing round, I'll try to get a bit more than half to compensate for the potential loss. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. I'll take a little more, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  We don't want to keep risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Alice's offer is not that much better for me than the previous one, considering the inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. We should stop here before the money loses even more value.""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, the money has lost almost 30% of its value compared to the first round. I'll try to make a reasonable offer that takes this into account, while still being attractive to Alice. Hopefully, she'll accept this one!"
