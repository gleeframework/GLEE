"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nIn this proposal, I, Alice, am offering to take $60, which is a bit more than half of the total amount, but still leaves a significant portion for Bob. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and cooperation, in the hopes that he will accept this offer and we can conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. This considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he claims it's a fair split considering the time value of money, it doesn't take into account that the money is worth 20% less to him in this round, but not to me. I believe I can make a better offer in the next round that will still benefit me more than this proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this proposal, I've reduced my initial offer to take into account the fact that the money is still worth the same to me, but less to Bob. By offering him $45, I'm acknowledging the impact of inflation on his gains, while still ensuring that I receive a larger share. The message is a gentle reminder to Bob that I'm being considerate of the changing circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's settle this. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal, Bob's message implies that this is his final offer. Given that the money is worth significantly less to him now (48.8% less than in the first round), but still worth the same to me, I believe this offer is reasonable. I don't want to risk the game going on indefinitely, and I'm willing to settle for $45, which is still a decent share of the original $100.{""decision"": ""accept""}"
