"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. Take this offer, or risk getting nothing in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob knows that if he rejects the offer, Alice will have to make a proposal, and with the 20% inflation, the money will be worth less in the next round. He can then propose a more favorable split for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 900000,

  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair deal. We both get something, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round.""
