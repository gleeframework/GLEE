Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty generous offer considering I have the advantage of knowing about the inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty fair considering the inflation. I'd rather take 500,000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
