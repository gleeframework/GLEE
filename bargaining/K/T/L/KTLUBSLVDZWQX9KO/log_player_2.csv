Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but your offer was a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? 57.5% for me and 42.5% for you. It's still a significant gain for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000
