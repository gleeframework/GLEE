"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start! Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth the same for me, but 10% less for Bob, I'm actually getting a slightly better deal than in Bob's initial offer. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
