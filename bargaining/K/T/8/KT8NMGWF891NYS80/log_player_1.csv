"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money. Will Bob accept or reject?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer, I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make my own offer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and leaving room for Bob to negotiate."

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
