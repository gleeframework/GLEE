"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness you're trying to achieve, but I think we can do better.  I propose we split it 60/40 in my favor, since the inflation will affect you more than it will affect me. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
