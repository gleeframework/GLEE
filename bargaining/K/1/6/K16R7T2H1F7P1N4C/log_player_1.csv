"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my $300,000 gain is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $285,000. And Bob's $700,000 gain is still worth $700,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $570,000 (95% of $600,000). I'll aim for a slightly better deal this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a good deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my $450,000 gain is actually worth 86.74% of what it was in the first round, which is $432,900 (86.74% of $500,000). I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'll consider it.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing, and I'm willing to end the game here."
