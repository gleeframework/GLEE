It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out completely. I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 1% of the original amount. I'd rather start over from scratch than accept this offer.

Since we've reached the 12th round and I've rejected Bob's offer, I think it's fair to conclude that we won't be able to come to an agreement."
