Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my impatience with inflation. While her offer seems to acknowledge the decreasing value, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I also need to be mindful that time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is my bottom line. Let's be reasonable and close the deal.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but her definition of ""compromise"" still heavily favors her. We're past the halfway point, and she's likely banking on me getting desperate. I need to show I'm willing to walk away, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm holding firm at a 55/45 split, but making it clear this is non-negotiable.  We're getting dangerously close to the deadline, and while I'm willing to risk it, I need to signal I'm serious.  Alice will likely try one more lowball offer, but she'll have to concede soon."
