"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the total amount, and keeping $80 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than his gain in the first round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keep the majority of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You were close, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a good chunk for myself.""
}
```"
