"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 70/30, I'll take the smaller share this time.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial 100$ and leaves 30% for Bob. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the value of the money decreases for me in each round. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still value the 45% share as 45$. However, for Bob, the 55% share is worth 10% less than the original 55$, which is 49.5$. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal. Considering the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, 60/40, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game!"
