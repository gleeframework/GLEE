Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but that's my final offer 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Bob) with each round. While Alice's offer still heavily favors her, waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal. Taking $43 now, though far from ideal, is better than risking even less in future rounds."
