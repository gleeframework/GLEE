"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives you a significant share of the money, but also allows Bob to get something. It's a good starting point to see if he's willing to accept a less than perfect offer, considering the risk of getting nothing in the end."
