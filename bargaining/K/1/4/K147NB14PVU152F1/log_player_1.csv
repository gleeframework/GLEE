"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I think it's fair to take advantage of the fact that we're both losing money with each round, so I'd like to split it more evenly, with a slight edge towards me this time.  We both get a better deal that way. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
