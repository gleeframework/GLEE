Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split Alice, but considering the inflation, I propose a slightly adjusted division for this round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
