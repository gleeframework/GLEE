"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a generous offer to start. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the tables on me!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $320,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth $570,000.

I'll reject this offer. It's not a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. My offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still keeping the majority for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, but with a slightly smaller amount for me.

Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $226,800, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth $470,750.

I'll reject this offer. It's still not a good deal for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less due to inflation. My offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more even split, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
