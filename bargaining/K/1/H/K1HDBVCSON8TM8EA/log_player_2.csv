It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get more.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."

I'm going to flip the offer and see if Alice is willing to accept.  I'm hoping she values the money more than the control of proposing in the next round."

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired split.  The inflation is really hitting her hard, and I think she's starting to panic a little.  I'll take this offer and secure some money before it's too late."
