"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this offer and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of proposing first. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more for taking the risk of proposing first, huh? Well, I'm not convinced. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only 40% of the original amount. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! My gain is worth a lot less now. Considering Bob's previous rejection, I'm not inclined to accept an offer that's only slightly more generous. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. My proposal for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more generous, Bob. This is a fair split, considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you all the money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'm starting to think I should take what I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $3,000. At least I'll get something out of this, even if it's not the best deal."
