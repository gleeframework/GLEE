Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness too, but with the inflation we face, this split makes more sense. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the game's current state
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money is worth 20% less for me (Alice) and 10% less for Bob due to inflation from the original amount in each subsequent round.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the money for both players
Given the original amount is $10,000, for me (Alice), after two rounds, the money's value has decreased by 20% each round. So, for me, the current value is $10,000 * (1 - 0.20)^2 = $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400. For Bob, the money's value decreases by 10% each round, so the current value is $10,000 * (1 - 0.10)^2 = $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100.

### Step 3: Consider Bob's previous offer and adjust accordingly
Bob's offer in Round 2 was $4,000 for me and $6,000 for himself, which I rejected. Considering the decreasing value of money, I need to make an offer that is appealing enough for Bob to accept but still benefits me.

### Step 4: Make a new offer considering the decreased value and Bob's perspective
Given the money's decreased value, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me but is reasonable enough for Bob to consider, given his last offer. I'll offer $5,000 for myself and $5,000 for Bob, with a message emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial agreement considering the inflation.

### Step 5: Format the offer in the required JSON format
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle for mutual benefit.""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle for mutual benefit.""}"
