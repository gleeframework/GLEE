Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice offered 40, I'll offer 60, hoping she'll accept this time.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the values are now:

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 (in terms of the original value, it's 45 / 0.8 = 56.25)
# Alice gain: 55 (in terms of the original value, it's 55 / 0.909 = 60.44)

I'll take the deal, since it's better than what I got in round 1, and it's still a good deal considering the inflation.
