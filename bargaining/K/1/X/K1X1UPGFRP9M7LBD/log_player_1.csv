Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm starting with a highly uneven split, aiming to maximize my potential gain while still leaving Bob with a tiny incentive to accept.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I am aware of the inflation affecting Bob. It's unlikely he will offer me a better deal in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent portion of the money."
