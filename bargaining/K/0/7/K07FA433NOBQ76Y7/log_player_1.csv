"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm still being generous. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather not take a smaller share than what I initially proposed, but I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
