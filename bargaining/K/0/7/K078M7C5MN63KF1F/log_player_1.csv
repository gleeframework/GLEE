I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept, even though it's a tiny share for him. This gives me a good chunk of the money and sets a precedent for my future offers.  I'm not concerned about inflation yet - I'm focused on getting the largest piece of the pie."
