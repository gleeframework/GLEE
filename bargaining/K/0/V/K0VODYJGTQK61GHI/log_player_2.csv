Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90, you take 10. We can always negotiate later if you're not happy.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45. We're both getting a decent amount, and it's closer to what I think is fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice's gain is affected by inflation, she might be willing to compromise more in the next rounds. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince Alice's gain is decreasing due to inflation, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll offer a deal where I take 58, and Alice can take 42. Let's see if she accepts!
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal.""}"
