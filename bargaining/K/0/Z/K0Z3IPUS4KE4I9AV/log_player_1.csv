"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust if needed. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of the original $8,000, which is $7,600.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I think it's a fair starting point. I'll accept Bob's offer.
