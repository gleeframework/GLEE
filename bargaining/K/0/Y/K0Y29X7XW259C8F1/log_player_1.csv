"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $40 I would get is only worth 80% of the original $50, which is $40. But I'll consider the offer as is, since I don't know how inflation affects Bob.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount I would get if I accept this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent of $50 (the original 50% I would get in the first round) in terms of the current round's value.

Original $50 / 1.488 (1 - 0.848) = $33.67

Since Bob's offer is 45, which is more than $33.67, I'll accept this offer.
