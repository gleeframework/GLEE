"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. It's only fair since I get to propose first. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, it's still better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future, and the inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the money."
