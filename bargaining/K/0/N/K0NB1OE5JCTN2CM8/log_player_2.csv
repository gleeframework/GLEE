"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it almost equally, considering I made the first offer 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems tempting at first glance, I lose value faster than she does with each passing round. It's strategically better to wait for a more favorable offer in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you wanted a slight advantage for your first offer, so I'm proposing the same split but reversed. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reversal:**  By mirroring Alice's offer, I'm showing her I understand the concept of an opening advantage but am aiming for a more favorable outcome for myself. 
* **Time Pressure:**  While I'm willing to wait for a better deal, I also want to apply pressure.  Alice loses value slower than me, so a quick resolution is still in my best interest.
* **Appearance of Fairness:** The message is framed to make my proposal seem reasonable and even generous, potentially swaying Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the loss, but still giving you a fair share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer acknowledges inflation but still doesn't fully compensate for my losses, especially as we progress further into the game. While a 4200 gain is tempting, I believe holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round or two is a better strategy.  The pressure of inflation is increasing for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose with every round. This offer gives you a decent share while acknowledging the impact of inflation on my end. Let's be practical and secure our gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Demand:** Alice is clearly aiming for the larger share. I'm slightly raising my demand from the previous round to reflect the increasing pressure of inflation and the need for a favorable resolution.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time constraint, reminding Alice that a no-deal scenario hurts us both. 
* **Compromise (Slight):**  While pushing for a better share, I'm still offering Alice a reasonable amount to encourage her to accept. 
* **Avoiding Greed:** I'm conscious that being overly aggressive could backfire. This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly. This is still a reasonable split considering the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the impact of inflation, her offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable to me. A 4000 gain represents a significant loss compared to the initial rounds, especially considering my money devalues faster.  It's getting risky, but I need to push for a better split while rounds remain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5700,
""alice_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and patience.  I'm offering a split that reflects the urgency of the situation. It's time to be realistic and take what's still a decent deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  I'm holding my ground on the split proposed in Round 4. While I need to secure a deal, I can't afford to drastically reduce my demand this late in the game.
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is more direct, reflecting the increasing tension and limited time. 
* **Final Push:** This offer is a calculated risk. It might be my last chance to secure a share close to my target before the dwindling value forces me to make more desperate offers."
