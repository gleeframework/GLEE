I'm proposing a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly as the first player. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the 0% I would get if I reject and the game continues, it's still significantly less than what I initially proposed. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm going to try to get closer to my original 90/10 split, but I need to take into account the inflation and Bob's likely desire to secure a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 488000 
# Bob gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. My gains are significantly lower than my original proposal due to inflation. However, rejecting this offer will mean I get nothing in the next round.  It's better to take what I can get at this point."
