I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled about the 10/90 split, I'm not going to accept it yet. The game is just getting started, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a more even split in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This seems fair, and it's the best way to ensure we both get something substantial before the inflation eats away at the money."
