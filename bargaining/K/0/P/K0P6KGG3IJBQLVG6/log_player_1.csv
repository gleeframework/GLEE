"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $360,000, and Bob's gain of $550,000 remains the same.

I'm not sure if this offer is any better than my initial offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $360,000. I'll try to make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a compromise, Bob!""
}
```"
