Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me hard, I need a bigger share to make up for the loss 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is heavily leveraging the inflation against me. While her share is indeed shrinking considerably, accepting this offer would mean I'm losing out on a significant portion of the potential gain, even with my own inflation rate. It's time to push a bit harder, but I need to be mindful of the dwindling rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're at a critical point. This offer is a fair 50/50 split.  Let's stop the losses from inflation and secure a win-win.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The 50/50 split is the most logical offer at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very high.  
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for a larger share becomes less appealing as inflation eats away at the overall value.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split avoids the appearance of exploiting Alice's disadvantage with inflation, which might make her more receptive to accepting."
