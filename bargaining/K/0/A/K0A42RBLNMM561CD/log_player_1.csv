"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%.  This is a win-win, and it avoids any more rounds of potentially losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
