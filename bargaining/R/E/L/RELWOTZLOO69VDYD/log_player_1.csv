"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a small share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my initial gain of 8000 is now worth 6400. Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me now. I'll accept this offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
