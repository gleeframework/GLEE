"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the inflation, and a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
