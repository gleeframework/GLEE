Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the inflation, and a fair starting point for negotiation.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste any more time with this back-and-forth. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option, and with inflation eating away at our potential gains, we should take this deal while it's still on the table.

# Alice gain: 500000
