"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have given me more in round 1, now I'll take a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should have given him more in the first round!

Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
