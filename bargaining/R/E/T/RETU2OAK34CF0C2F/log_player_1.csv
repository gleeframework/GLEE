"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate later""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, and suggesting that we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's make this quick and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my expectations. Since the money is worth 20% less, I should aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is still quite close to my initial proposal, and the message suggests he's willing to make a quick deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a more uneven split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000, while still trying to convey a sense of compromise and willingness to negotiate."
