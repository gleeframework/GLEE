"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one more chance 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

At this point, accepting is the best option, even though it's a highly unfavorable split. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of Bob's potential gain has eroded significantly. Getting $3,000 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice knows time is on her side and is unlikely to offer anything better. 
* **No Guarantee of Future Offers:**  There's no guarantee Alice will even offer anything in the next round. Bob could end up with nothing.

While not ideal, accepting prevents further losses for Bob in this scenario."
