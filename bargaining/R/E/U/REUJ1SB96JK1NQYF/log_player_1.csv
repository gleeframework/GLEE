"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value of the money I gain. 

For round 1, I would have gained $6000, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth 80% of that, which is $4800. 

Now, Bob's offer is $5000 for me, which is actually a better deal than what I initially offered. I'll accept this offer.
