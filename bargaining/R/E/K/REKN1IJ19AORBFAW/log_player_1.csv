I propose that I get $99, and Bob gets $1. I think it's best to get as much as possible in the first round, as the longer the game goes on, the more likely we are to both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. This is fair and gives both of us a good amount of money. We only have 12 rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
