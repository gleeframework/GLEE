"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but in reality, I'm trying to get a bigger share since I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping to get a better deal, and this one is still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, which is $7,000, and Bob gets the remaining $3,000. I'm trying to be more conciliatory and offer a slightly better deal, while still maintaining a slight edge in the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer either. The value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I'm not willing to accept a split that's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get 65% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,500, and Bob gets the remaining $3,500. I'm trying to be more flexible and offer a slightly better deal, while still trying to maintain a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair offer. With the rapid inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. Splitting it evenly seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and risk getting a worse deal."
