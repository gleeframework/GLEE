"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering we both have an equal chance of getting the better end of the deal in the long run.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being fair, but I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 55:45, I'll try to shift the ratio a bit more in my favor.

  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
