Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Your turn to accept or reject. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, the money is worth less, but I need to make a decision.

I will reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 60% of the remaining money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to accept or reject.""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value.

I'll analyze Bob's offer for Round 4:

* Alice gain: 450,000
* Bob gain: 550,000

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll think carefully...

I will reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer for Round 5:

}
```

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now.

I'll analyze Bob's offer for Round 6:

* Alice gain: 500,000
* Bob gain: 500,000

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split either.

I will reject Bob's offer from Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling the value of the money now.

I'll analyze Bob's offer for Round 8:

* Alice gain: 300,000
* Bob gain: 700,000

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split either.

I will reject Bob's offer from Round 8:

```

# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is almost completely erasing the value of the money now.

I'll analyze Bob's offer for Round 10:

* Alice gain: 150,000
* Bob gain: 850,000

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'm not surprised that Bob is trying to take the majority of it. However, I'm not willing to accept a 15-85 split.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has almost completely destroyed the value of the money.

I'll analyze Bob's offer for Round 12:

* Alice gain: 100,000
* Bob gain: 900,000

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'm not surprised that Bob is trying to take the majority of it. I've tried to negotiate and make deals, but it seems like Bob is not willing to compromise.

I will accept Bob's offer from Round 12:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the 10-90 split, even though it's not ideal. At this point, I'd rather get some money than nothing."
