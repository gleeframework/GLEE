I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a strong starting point that reflects my belief that I should get the larger share. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is essentially a complete reversal of my initial proposal.  While the inflation is hurting me more, I still believe I have the upper hand because we have more rounds to go. By rejecting this offer, I force Bob to make a new proposal in the next round, giving me another chance to negotiate. This will give me more information on how Bob is valuing the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced. While I still want a larger share, I recognize the need to be more reasonable to avoid losing everything.  A 60/40 split seems like a good compromise given the inflation and the risk of going another round without a deal.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still prioritizing my own interests. Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is getting interesting! The inflation is hitting me harder, and Bob is clearly trying to capitalize on that. While a 40/60 split in his favor seems like a decent deal in the current context, I'm still holding out.  Rejecting again forces him to propose again in the next round. With more rounds to go, I still believe I have a chance to get a better deal, especially as inflation continues to take its toll."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm now adjusting my offer significantly. The inflation is biting hard, and I need to show flexibility.  A 30/70 split in Bob's favor is a risky move, but it's necessary to avoid losing everything.  If I'm going to lose out, I need to minimize the losses. This is a gamble, but it's a gamble I'm willing to take to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
