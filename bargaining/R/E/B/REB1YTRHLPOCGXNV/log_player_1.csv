"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fairer split is 900,000 for me and 100,000 for you.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids us having to play another round and lose value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
