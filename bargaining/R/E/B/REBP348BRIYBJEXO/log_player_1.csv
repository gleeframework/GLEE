"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split for a fair and quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, his $500,000 is now worth 10% less, or $450,000 in real value, while my $500,000 is still worth the full amount. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $450,000, which, considering the 10% decrease in value for him, is equivalent to about $405,000 in real value for him now, and I'll take $550,000. I've included a message explaining that this split takes inflation into account, hoping Bob will see it as a more reasonable offer."
