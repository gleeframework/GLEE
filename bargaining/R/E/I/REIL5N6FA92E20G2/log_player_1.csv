"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather not accept a proposal that gives me less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller share for myself, but still a more favorable split than the one Bob proposed in round 2."
