"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. Bob's offer is a 52-48 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
