Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, as I know the money will be worth less to Bob in later rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52.5 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer. Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, and with inflation, his offer will only get worse in the next round. It's a good deal for me, and I'm not risking losing everything."
