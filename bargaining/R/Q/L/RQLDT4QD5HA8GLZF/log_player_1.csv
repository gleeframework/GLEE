"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 300,000 * 0.9 (10% less) = 270,000
* Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.8 (20% less) = 560,000

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $550,000 and keeping $450,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
