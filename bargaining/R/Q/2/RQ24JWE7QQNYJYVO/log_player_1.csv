"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's share is worth the same for him, but I'm not getting any younger.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my share of the money is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.8). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also preparing for another round if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split, but I'm willing to compromise again. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. My share of $4500 is now worth only 36.8% of what it was in the first round (100% * 0.768 * 0.8 * 0.848). Bob's share of $5500 is worth 44.26% of what it was in the first round (100% * 0.95 * 0.85).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the decreasing value of money. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
