"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $10,000. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a significant difference in the split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 3:7 split, as it seems too skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway between our previous offers. Is this more acceptable to you?""
}
```

This offer is closer to my original proposal, but still gives Bob a slightly larger share than his previous offer. What do you think, Bob?"
