Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because I feel that a 45-55 split in his favor is not fair, considering my initial offer was the opposite and he rejected it. I'd like to proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money is 10,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 9,025. I will adjust my offer accordingly to reflect the decreased value but still aim for a slightly favorable split, acknowledging the need for compromise due to the decreasing value of the money.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise""}\n\nI'm offering a 51-49 split in my favor, with a message to Bob highlighting the need to consider the impact of inflation and to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
