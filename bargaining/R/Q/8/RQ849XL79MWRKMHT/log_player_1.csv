"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since the money is worth less to me due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob. Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

Since Bob's money is worth 20% less due to inflation, his gain of 60 is actually equivalent to 60 / 0.8 = 75 in the first round. That's a significant advantage for him.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60, and considering the inflation, his gain was actually equivalent to 75 in the first round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 45 is a fair share considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than he had proposed in round 2, but still a bit more than the original 50/50 split. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm getting desperate and need some cash now. You can have a big chunk, but I'm not giving up completely. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit more desperate!

Considering the effects of inflation, Bob's gain of 30 is actually equivalent to 30 / 0.516 (1 - 0.488) = 58.14 in the first round. That's a significant decrease in value for him.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Giving me 70 means I'll get a larger share, but it also means Bob will get a relatively small share.

After some thought, I'll decide to reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 30, and considering the inflation, his gain was actually equivalent to 58.14 in the first round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 40 is a fair share considering the value of the money to you.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than he had proposed in round 4, but still a bit more than the original 50/50 split. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
