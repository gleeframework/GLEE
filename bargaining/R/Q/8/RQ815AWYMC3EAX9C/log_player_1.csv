"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I offered $60, which is 60% of the original $100. Due to inflation, this is now worth 80% of its original value (since 100% - 20% = 80%). So, the $60 I would have gained is now worth $48.

In this round, Bob is offering me $40, which is 40% of the original $100. This is worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $32.

Since I would be giving up $48 for $32, I think I'm getting a worse deal. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (80% of the previous 80%), I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}
```
I'm offering to take 32% of the original $100, which is now worth $32, and leaving $68 for Bob."
