"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

The original 1,000,000$ is now worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * 1,000,000 = 950,000$.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 500,000$ and Bob will get 500,000$. Since the money is worth 95% of its original value, I'll actually get 0.95 * 500,000 = 475,000$.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd rather try to negotiate further and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

The original 1,000,000$ is now worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * 0.95 * 1,000,000 = 902,500$.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, hoping that Bob will accept this slightly more skewed split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

The original 1,000,000$ is now worth (1 - 0.1426) = 0.8574 of its original value, which is 0.8574 * 1,000,000 = 857,400$.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 475,000$ and Bob will get 525,000$. Since the money is worth 85.74% of its original value, I'll actually get 0.8574 * 475,000 = 407,895$.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because I think 407,895$ is a decent deal, considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting close to the 12-round limit."
