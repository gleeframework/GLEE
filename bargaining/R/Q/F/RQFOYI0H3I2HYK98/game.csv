6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40. Your share is higher because you're losing money faster.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation rate we're facing. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Okay, let's try a compromise.  Since we both need to account for inflation, I'm proposing 5400 for me and 4600 for you. This way, we both get a slightly higher share than the previous round. What do you think?",Alice,3,
