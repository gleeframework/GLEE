"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split, especially considering the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
