"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While 3000 dollars is a decent amount, the risk of inflation makes it unwise to accept the first offer.  By rejecting, Bob can gain more in the next round as the value of Alice's proposed share will decrease due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the risk of inflation and allows both of us to receive a reasonable amount.""
