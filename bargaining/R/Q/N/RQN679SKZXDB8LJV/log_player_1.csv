"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think about it for a moment... Since Bob is offering a 60-40 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

After considering the offer, I'll:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment... With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious.

After considering the offer, I'll:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the 300,000, but I'm hoping I can do better in future rounds!"
