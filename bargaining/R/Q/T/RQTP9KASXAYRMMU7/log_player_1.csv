"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the game started, while keeping most of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a fair split this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious now that the money is worth less. Since the offer is a 50/50 split, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
