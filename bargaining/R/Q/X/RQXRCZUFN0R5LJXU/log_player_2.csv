Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a better deal, but I'm willing to come down to 60/40.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 400000

**Reasoning:**

Even though inflation is eating into my potential gains, accepting 40% now would be significantly less than what I could gain if I hold out for a better offer in the next round or two. Alice knows time is running out for me, but it's also running out for her."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money by being stubborn. 52.5/47.5 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. Every round that passes eats into Bob's potential gains significantly.
* **Strong Stance:** By presenting this as his ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency and signals he's unwilling to budge much further. 
* **Reasonable Split:**  While it's not a perfect 50/50, it's a much more balanced proposal than what Alice has been offering. It shows a willingness to compromise but also establishes a firm boundary. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might reject this, but the potential reward of securing a larger share is worth the gamble at this stage."
