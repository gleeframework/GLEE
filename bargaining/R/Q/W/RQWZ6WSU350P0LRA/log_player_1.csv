"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly better deal for myself this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll get $40 and Bob will get $60. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise considering the changing value of money."
