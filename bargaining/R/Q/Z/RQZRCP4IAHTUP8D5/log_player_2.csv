"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation rate will affect you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation will impact us both, but more so you. Let's see if we can agree!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is heavily skewed in your favor considering the inflation.  I'm willing to meet in the middle - this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher amount, I'm worried about the inflation eroding the value of the money further. This offer is a compromise, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
