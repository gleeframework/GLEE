"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end it here!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a bit. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 30$ is actually worth 24$ (80% of 30$).

I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, but I'm willing to accept this offer to move forward and potentially get a better deal in the next round.
