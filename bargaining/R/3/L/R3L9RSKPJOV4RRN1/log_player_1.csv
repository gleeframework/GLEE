"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80-20. I'll take the smaller share, you can have the larger one.""}

I'm proposing that I take 80% of the money ($800,000) and Bob takes 20% ($200,000). I'm willing to take the smaller share, hoping that Bob will accept this fair and reasonable offer."
