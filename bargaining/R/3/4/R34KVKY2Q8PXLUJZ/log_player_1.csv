"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will set a good tone for the rest of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting the money!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going too low, so I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
