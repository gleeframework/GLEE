"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive opening offer. I want to get the majority of the money, but I'm also leaving a little bit for Bob to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, Bob's offer is extremely unfair.  I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to compromise a bit more in this round, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I think Bob might be more willing to accept a more equitable offer after his aggressive play in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is more equitable than the last round, it's still not great.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, but I'm going to stick to my guns and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is really starting to impact the value of the money, so I'm going for a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, and I think Bob might be willing to accept it to avoid losing more money to inflation."
