"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40:60, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio for me. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! Okay, let me think...

Considering the inflation, the actual value of my gain would be 36% less than the initial $40, which is $26.40. Alice's gain would be $31.50.

In this case, I'll accept the offer to get some money, even though it's not ideal. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
