"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable.  This offer ensures we both benefit.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Rejecting it was necessary to signal that a fairer split is required.
* **My Offer:**
    * It's crucial to offer Alice slightly more than she would get in the next round if she rejects my offer (which would be worth 90% of her initial offer: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400). 
    * My offer provides me with a gain of 4800, which is more than what I would get in the next round (4000 * 0.8 = 3200) if I were to simply accept her initial offer after the devaluation. 
* **The Message:** Maintaining a collaborative tone is key. While my offer is more balanced, I want to avoid antagonizing Alice and keep the negotiation open."
