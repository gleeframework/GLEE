Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a good share and can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
