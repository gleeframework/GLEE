"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, and I think I can do better than 4000$."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You offered me 4000, I'll meet you halfway""
}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway between his previous offer and a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get back to his original 60/40 split. I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to push for a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're close to your original offer, meet me halfway""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor a bit more, but still leaving room for negotiation."
