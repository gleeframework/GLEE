"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. Let's see if you like it!""
}
```

I'm offering to give myself $70 and Bob $30. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for the negotiations!"

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. I'm sure we can both agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up 20 dollars. Let's try to negotiate further.""

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is catching up quickly! Okay, let's think about Bob's new offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable giving you 60% of the money. I think I can do better than that.""

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! Okay, let's think about Bob's final offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 70% of the money. I think I can do better than that. It's getting late in the game, so I'll make a counteroffer.""
