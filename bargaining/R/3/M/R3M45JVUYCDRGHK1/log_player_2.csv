Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While her offers might seem ""fair"" on the surface, Bob is losing value with every passing round. It's time to play hardball and show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""We're wasting time. This is a fair split. Let's end this.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases for Bob.  It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Strong Stance:**  By offering a 50/50 split, Bob demonstrates that he's serious about a fair deal and not going to be bullied by Alice's tactics.
* **Simplicity:**  A straightforward offer might be more appealing to Alice than continued haggling. It signals a desire to end the negotiations quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Half isn't fair considering the inflation, I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical decision based on the following:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game continues, the less Bob will gain even if he manages to secure a slightly better split in later rounds. The 46.86% inflation already significantly impacts the value.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice rejecting a 50/50 split indicates she might be unwilling to settle for anything less than a considerable advantage.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing carries a high risk of getting zero if Alice continues to play hardball. Accepting guarantees Bob at least some profit.

This situation highlights the power dynamics of negotiation when one party faces a time disadvantage."
