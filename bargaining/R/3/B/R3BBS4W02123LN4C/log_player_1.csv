"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, leaving Bob with 10% of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less to me, I still have 10 rounds left, and I can make a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, giving Bob 20%. This is still a good deal for me, considering the inflation, and I hope it's enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even though the inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my gains, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm raising my offer again, hoping to reach a compromise. Bob is clearly pushing for a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. I know I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal.  I have a few rounds left and I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try one more time to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm raising my offer to 60% for myself, leaving 40% for him.  This is getting risky with the inflation, but I believe it's the best chance I have of reaching a deal before the remaining rounds leave me with very little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. I know the inflation is making my gains significantly smaller, but I'm not giving up just yet. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping Bob might start feeling the pressure to reach an agreement as well."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is really hurting my potential gains. I'm going to try to split the money evenly. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's the best deal for both of us at this point. If not, we'll both end up with nothing."
