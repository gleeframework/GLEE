6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Let's split the money 55/45. It's a fair deal considering the inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,How about we reverse your offer from the last round? Seems fair considering the time pressure.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 58/42 is a reasonable split. We should settle before the money loses more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. We're running out of time. I'm offering you a larger share than your last proposal. Take it before the money shrinks further!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,We're halfway through the rounds and the money's value is dropping fast. I think 60/40 is a fair split at this point. Let's settle before it's too late.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
