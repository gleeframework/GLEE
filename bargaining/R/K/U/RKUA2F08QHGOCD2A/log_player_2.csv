**Reasoning:** While this offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out and the inflation is working against me.  I need to push for a more favorable outcome in the next couple of rounds."

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting a 49/51 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal later or even timing out completely. Alice knows the pressure is on me and is unlikely to offer anything better."
