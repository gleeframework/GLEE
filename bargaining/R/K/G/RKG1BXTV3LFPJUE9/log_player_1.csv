"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

 I'm going to propose a split that favors me slightly.  It's still a fair offer, and if Bob rejects it, he'll be at a disadvantage in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to take this offer.  If I reject it, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, and I risk getting an even worse offer."
