"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 100,000 * 0.8 = 80,000.

I'll reject this offer since I'm not getting a fair share.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and 40% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
