Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm taking a risk here, but I think I can get a better deal by offering Alice less this round. I'm hoping she'll realize that if we keep rejecting each other, the money will lose value faster for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less now, it's better to take what I can get than to risk losing even more in the next round."
