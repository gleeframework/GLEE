**Reasoning:**

While it's frustrating that Bob is being stubborn, considering the inflation, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is now worth 14.26% less than the initial round.  If I keep rejecting, I risk further inflation, potentially making the deal worse for me in the future.
* **Limited Gains:** Bob's offer is still significantly better than the previous round.  While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable gain considering the circumstances.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to reject offers carries the risk of a worse deal due to inflation. Accepting this offer at least secures a decent amount of money."
