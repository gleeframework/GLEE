"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking $600,000 and Bob taking $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also hinting that I'm willing to take the smaller share this round to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a big share last round, now it's my turn to take the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain worth the same and Bob's money worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more even split to take advantage of the decreasing value of Bob's money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a reasonable portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still in the lead 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, he's gaining even less value from the split. I'll take a closer look at the numbers.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time for a 50-50 split, let's call it a draw""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's money is worth less and less with each passing round."
