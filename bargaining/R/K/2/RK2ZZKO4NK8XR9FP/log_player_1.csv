"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory problem. I'm aiming for the best possible outcome for myself, knowing that Bob will likely be more motivated to reach an agreement in later rounds as the inflation devalues the money. By offering him a tiny amount, I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to take more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the potential for inflation to completely devalue Bob's share in the next round. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a significant portion of the money."
