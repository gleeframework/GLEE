"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point.""}\n\nHow's that? I made an offer where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000, with a message suggesting that a 60-40 split is a fair starting point. Let me know what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer, as I think I can get a better deal. Besides, it's only the second round, and I don't want to settle for 45% just yet. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway on the 60-40, but I still think I deserve the bigger share.""}\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts to this offer. I've reduced my initial proposal slightly, but still think I should get the larger share. The message is an attempt to appear willing to compromise while still asserting my position."
