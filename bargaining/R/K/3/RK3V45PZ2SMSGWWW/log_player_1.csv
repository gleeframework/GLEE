# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take an even bigger share of the money now. I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal than give Bob a 65% share of the money, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
