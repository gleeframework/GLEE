"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but let's be practical. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm offering you a chance to get something. You can either accept or risk getting nothing in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. We both lose out if this drags on. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the time pressure.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still feel like I deserve a larger share.  Let's meet in the middle.  Accept this, and we can both get something. Reject it, and the money will continue to shrink. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting 40% when the value is decreasing so rapidly still puts Bob at a significant disadvantage.  It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable outcome."

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The money is losing value with every second we waste. Let's be reasonable and split it 50/50. Deal?""}
