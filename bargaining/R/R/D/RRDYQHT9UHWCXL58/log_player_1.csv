"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer, since I'd be getting $50, which is worth less than $50 in the first round. I'll try to do better than that.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to be careful. $45 is worth significantly less than $50, so I'll have to decide whether it's worth accepting.
