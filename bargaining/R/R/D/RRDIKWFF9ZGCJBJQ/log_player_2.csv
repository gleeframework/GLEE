Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was tempting, Bob, but the inflation hit isn't that significant yet. Let's meet in the middle - 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I understand the pressure.  53/47, my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:**  The longer the game goes on, the less value the money has for Bob due to the 20% inflation hit each round.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems firm and unlikely to budge much from her 55/45 offer in Round 3. Waiting for a better deal might not happen.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks getting a worse deal in later rounds, potentially ending up with nothing if they don't reach an agreement. 

While 47% isn't ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing or accepting a smaller amount as the rounds progress."
