Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking the lion's share, knowing that Bob has to accept it or we go to the next round, where inflation may kick in.  This is a risky strategy, but I'm willing to gamble!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though I would prefer to get more, it's better to accept this offer. There's no guarantee that Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round, and I'm not sure how much inflation is affecting him. This seems like the safest choice."
