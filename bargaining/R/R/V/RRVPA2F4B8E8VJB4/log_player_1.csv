Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very large portion for myself, leaving a small amount for Bob.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob accepts, I get the majority of the money.  If he rejects, we'll have 11 more rounds to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll want to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's a significant improvement over the previous round, it's still not a fair split.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a small fraction of the money.  I'll take my chances with the inflation and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer.  The inflation is starting to affect both of us now, and it's time to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
