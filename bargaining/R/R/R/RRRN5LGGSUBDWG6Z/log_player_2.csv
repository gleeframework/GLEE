"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a more favorable split. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still a 60/40 split, but now the money is worth less for her. I'll stick with my previous offer from Round 2, which was a 80/20 split. Since the money is worth the same for me, I'll try to stick with that. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable split. Given that the money is worth 36% less for Alice, I'll aim for an even larger share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}"
