"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering a relatively generous split to Bob, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer, but I'm still looking for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards his gain, but I'll try to get closer to a fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split!""
}
```

I'm trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will see the value in a more balanced proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, Alice. You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is now even more skewed towards his gain. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal. I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, especially with the money being worth so much less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be extremely cautious. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. This is my best offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering a very low share to Bob, hoping that he'll accept this proposal and we can finally settle the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. You're going to have to do a lot better than that if you want to get my share! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains now. With the money being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, Bob's offer is essentially a very small fraction of the original $100.

I'll have to think carefully about this one, but considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll have to accept this offer. I don't want to risk losing even more value due to further inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that this will finally end the negotiations and I can get some value out of the deal, no matter how small."
