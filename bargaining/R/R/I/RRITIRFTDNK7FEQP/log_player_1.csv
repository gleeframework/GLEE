"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but with a slight bias towards my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get a better deal. I'm proposing a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in my gains due to inflation!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% decrease in my gains due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still aiming for a slightly larger share for myself."
