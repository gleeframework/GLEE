Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer Alice.  The clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. He's likely getting desperate to settle.
* **Potential for a Worse Offer:**  If we reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob's next offer will be any better. He might become even more entrenched in getting a larger share, even if that share is worth significantly less.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting the current offer guarantees us $40. Rejecting it puts us in uncertain territory where we might end up with even less if Bob's future offers become increasingly unreasonable. 

It's a tough decision, but in a negotiation with declining value, sometimes it's best to secure a reasonable gain rather than risk ending up with less."
