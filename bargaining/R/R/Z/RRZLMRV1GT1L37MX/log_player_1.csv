"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both agree on this.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise on a 50/50 split, but I'll give you a slight advantage since you made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 in this round is actually worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round, which is $4000. So, in terms of purchasing power, I'm actually getting less than my original offer.

I'll have to think carefully about this...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the second round, my gain of $5000 in this round is actually worth 80% of what it would have been in the second round, which is $4000. I'll aim to get a better deal this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the original offer was unfair. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less in each round, my gain of $4800 in this round is actually worth 51.2% of what it would have been in the first round, which is approximately $5120. Considering the original offer was $4000, I think this is a decent compromise.
