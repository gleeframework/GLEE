"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to consider that in my decision.

After reviewing Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 400,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer takes into account the increased inflation rate and aims to give me a slightly higher share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, my gain is worth even less than before. After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 450,000 is a reasonable offer, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money."
