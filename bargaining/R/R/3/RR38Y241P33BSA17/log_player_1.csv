"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less this time, but I think this is a fair deal for both of us.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to consider that my gain of $4000 is worth the same as $5000 in the first round, but Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 20% less than $5000.

Let me calculate the effective values:

My gain: $4000 (same as in the first round)
Bob's gain: $6000 * 0.8 = $4800 (20% less than $6000)

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since Bob's gain seems to be more substantial than mine, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Given the inflation effect, I'll aim to increase my share to account for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need a fairer share to account for inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which I think is more in line with the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
