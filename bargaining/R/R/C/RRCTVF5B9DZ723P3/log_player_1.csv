"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $5,400, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject the offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $5,400 from the previous round is now worth $4,860, and Bob's gain of $3,800 is now worth $3,619.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, no more haggling!""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob an equal share of $5,000 each. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
