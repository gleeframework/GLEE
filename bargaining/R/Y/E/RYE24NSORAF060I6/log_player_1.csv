Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know the money's value is dropping, but I still think I can get a better deal. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While the money is losing value, accepting a deal significantly below 50% is not in my best interest.  I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable in the next round as the devaluation accelerates."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances.  Let's end this before the money loses more value."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a strategic concession to encourage Bob to settle.  Offering him slightly more than a 50/50 split, while still getting a decent share for myself, might be the key to ending the game before the devaluation hurts both of us more."
