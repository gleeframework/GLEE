"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can get a better deal later, don't rush! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 4000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. I need to be more aggressive with my proposal to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, Bob!""
