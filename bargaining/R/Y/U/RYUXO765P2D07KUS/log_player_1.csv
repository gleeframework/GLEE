Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the most efficient way to ensure we both get a fair share, and it saves us from the potential downsides of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
