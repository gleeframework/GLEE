"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Since the offer is equal, I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and the continued erosion of the money's value.
