"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars, leaving Bob with 40 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer to start, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're low, I'm high, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain are:

My gain: 30 * 0.95 = 28.5
Bob's gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain would be worth 4.375% of the original amount (95% of 95% of 100). I'll aim for a higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You were too high last time, I'm coming down to earth!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55 dollars, leaving Bob with 45 dollars. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's call it a draw! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain are:

My gain: 50 * 0.856 = 42.8
Bob's gain: 50 * 0.729 = 36.45

It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to another round with a lower value."
