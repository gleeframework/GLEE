Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets the remaining 20%."

Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer.
