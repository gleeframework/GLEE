Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion to start. Since I'm risk averse, I'll offer enough to hopefully get him to accept.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting less, it's still worth taking a chance that I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm hoping Bob will realize he needs to offer me more to secure my agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 7000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  The inflation is starting to affect Bob more than me, so I'm aiming for a deal before it gets too drastic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. The inflation is affecting Bob more than me, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's a fair split, and I'll take it!"
