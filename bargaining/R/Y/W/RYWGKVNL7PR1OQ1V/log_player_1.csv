Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split it evenly and get this done.  It's the best way to maximize what we both get. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, Alice loses a significant chunk of her potential earnings. Waiting longer means a worse deal for her, even if Bob makes slight concessions.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems firm on an even split. It's unlikely he'll offer significantly more in future rounds, especially with time (and money value) running out.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Alice a reasonable amount. Rejecting risks getting a much worse deal or even nothing if they don't reach an agreement in time."
