Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering I'm losing value faster.

# Bob gain: 58

``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's share, and it's better to accept this offer than risk getting even less in the next round."
