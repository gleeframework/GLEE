I'm offering you $6,000 and Bob $4,000.  I'm hoping this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiating further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money evenly.  Since the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, it seems like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is really starting to bite. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
