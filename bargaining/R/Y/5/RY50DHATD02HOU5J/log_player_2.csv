This offer is incredibly unfair. While it's tempting to take something, it's much better to try to negotiate a more equitable split.  Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to propose something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest and most likely to be accepted, ensuring both of us get a significant share of the money."
