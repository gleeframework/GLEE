"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this as a friendly gesture, but next round I expect a better deal. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With 20% inflation, the money will be worth less, but I think I can get a better deal than 10% of the original amount. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, this is a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split the difference from last round.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\nI'll accept this offer. With the inflation, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, and Alice has increased her offer from the previous round. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this is a reasonable deal, and Alice has stated it's her final offer. I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round."
