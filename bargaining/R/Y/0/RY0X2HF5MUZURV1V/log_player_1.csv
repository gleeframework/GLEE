"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd be getting $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, not 50%. I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering he's getting 60% of the original amount. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, due to inflation. My gain will be worth 5% less than in round 2, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to keep up with inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than the original amount, so I'd be getting $480,000, which is 48% of the original amount. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous, considering he's getting 52% of the original amount. I think I can do better than that.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 21.51% less than in the first round. My gain will be worth 10.75% less than in round 4, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money, but I still want a fair share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get left with nothing 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 22.62% less than the original amount, so I'd be getting $460,000, which is 46% of the original amount. Bob's offer is getting closer to the original 50/50 split, but I think he's still getting a bit too much, considering the inflation.

However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more reasonable in the next round.
