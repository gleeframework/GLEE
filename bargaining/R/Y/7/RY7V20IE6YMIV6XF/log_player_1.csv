"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair proposal considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
