"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice each round, she may be more willing to compromise later on. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for Alice each round, I'm trying to take advantage of that by offering her a slightly smaller share. This way, I'm still being somewhat fair, but also trying to maximize my own gain. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise, Bob. This is getting risky for me with each round. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth 19% less for Alice now, she's more likely to compromise further to avoid losing even more value. I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round to see if I can get an even better offer. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, Alice. I'll take a bit more.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 19% less for Alice now, I'm going to try to take advantage of that by offering her an even smaller share. I'm still being somewhat reasonable, but I'm trying to maximize my gain. Let's see how Alice responds! If she rejects this offer, I may need to start thinking about compromising more in the next round. But for now, I'll try to push my luck."
