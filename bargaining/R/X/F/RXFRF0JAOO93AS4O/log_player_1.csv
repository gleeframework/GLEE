Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 60% is a fairer split considering the risk of inflation. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
