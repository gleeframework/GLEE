Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get more. I'll offer 60 to myself and 40 to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:
My gain would be 36% less than 60, which is 60 * 0.64 = 38.4
Alice's gain is still 50, but its value is reduced by inflation, so it's 50 * 0.8 = 40

Since Alice's offer is 45-55, which is worse than my previous offer of 38.4-40, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 45-55, I'll try to get closer to 50-50. I'll offer 52 to myself and 48 to Alice.
