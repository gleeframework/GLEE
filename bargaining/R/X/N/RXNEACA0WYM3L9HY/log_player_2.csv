"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than 50/50.  I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a bigger piece of the pie to justify my risk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk losing even more with inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, even with the decreased value."
