"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take this generous offer, Bob! We can split the money and avoid a long game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the initial amount. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave him with a decent amount."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: A fair split, let's end the game 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation. Since I have to make a decision based on the new values, I'll consider the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject the offer because I can still get a better deal in subsequent rounds, considering the inflation effect."

  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Take this offer before I take it all!""
}
