"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see what happens next""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the lead.

I'll reject his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking the lead now, see if you'll accept""
}
```

I'm making a counteroffer to Bob's previous proposal, trying to take the lead and get a slightly larger share."
