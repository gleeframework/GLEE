"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a 90/10 split. I'm sure we can find a fair arrangement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a quick $1,000, it's important to consider the inflation. There are many rounds left, and if we keep rejecting, Alice's offer might get better, while my share of the money will shrink with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. Let's work towards a win-win situation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40% to make this worthwhile. How about a 55/45 split? It's fair and gives us both a chance to gain something. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 4500 gain is tempting, I need to consider the inflation.  My share is shrinking more rapidly than Alice's, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest solution given the current circumstances.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but I don't think we'll reach a better deal than this with the inflation factor in play.""
