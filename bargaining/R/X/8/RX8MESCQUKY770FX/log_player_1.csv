I'm starting with a very small offer to Bob, hoping to get most of the money in the first round. I figure Bob might accept since even a small amount is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to get something now than risk getting nothing in subsequent rounds as the value of the money decreases for me."
