I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially with the inflation factor in play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This offer is more even. Let's see what you think.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
The inflation is starting to impact me heavily. Even though I still think I could get a slightly better deal, I'm willing to accept this offer. I think it's a good compromise."
