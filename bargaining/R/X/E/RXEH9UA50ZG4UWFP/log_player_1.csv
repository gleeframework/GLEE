"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to get the game moving!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 5% less, which is $1,900.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
