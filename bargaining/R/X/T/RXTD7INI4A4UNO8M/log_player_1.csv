"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair start, given the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially since I'll be facing an even greater disadvantage in the next round due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of my earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share. Let's try 30/70.""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, acknowledging the increasing disadvantage I'll face due to inflation. I'm willing to accept a smaller share to try to reach a compromise."
