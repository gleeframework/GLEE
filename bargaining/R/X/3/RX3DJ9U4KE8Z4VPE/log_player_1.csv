"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering 60% of the initial $1,000,000 to myself and 40% to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

Alice's gain: 300,000 (initially 60% of $1,000,000, now worth 95% of $300,000 = $285,000)
Bob's gain: 700,000 (initially 40% of $1,000,000, now worth 80% of $700,000 = $560,000)

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the reduced values due to inflation, I'll aim to keep a larger share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering 42% of the initial $1,000,000 to myself and 58% to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values for round 4:

Initial values: $1,000,000
Inflation for Alice: 1 - 0.1426 = 85.74% of initial value
Inflation for Bob: 1 - 0.488 = 51.2% of initial value

Alice's gain: 400,000 (initially 40% of $1,000,000, now worth 85.74% of $400,000 = $343,096)
Bob's gain: 600,000 (initially 60% of $1,000,000, now worth 51.2% of $600,000 = $306,720)

I'll accept this offer.
