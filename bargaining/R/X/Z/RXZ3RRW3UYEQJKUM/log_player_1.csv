"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic.  I'm willing to offer you 40% of the money, which is a fair split considering the risk of inflation. This allows us to both get a good portion while minimizing the chance of losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
