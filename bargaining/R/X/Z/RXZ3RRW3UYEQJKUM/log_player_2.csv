"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Even though I'm aware of the 20% reduction in value each round, I don't know how the inflation affects Alice.  This means there's a good chance I can get a better deal in future rounds, especially if I make the offer. By rejecting, I can gain negotiating leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  I'm willing to offer you 40% of the money, which is a fair split considering the risk of inflation. This allows us to both get a good portion while minimizing the chance of losing everything.""
}
