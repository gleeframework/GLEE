Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to be as greedy as possible in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted by the offer and accept. After all, getting $1 is better than getting nothing.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.  It's better than getting nothing and I'll get a sizable amount.  Let's take it!"
