"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, how about a 60/40 split? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only the first round, and I'm not willing to settle for 40% just yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor. Since Alice is willing to start with a 60/40 split, I'll try to nudge it a bit closer to a 50/50 split, while also considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""How about we meet closer to the middle?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it down the middle this time.  We're both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting the 50/50 split now seems like the best option. In round 1, I was offered 40, which I rejected. Then, in round 2, I proposed a 55/45 split in my favor, which Alice rejected. Now, with Alice offering a 50/50 split and considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases (19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice), holding out for a marginally better deal might not be worth the risk of ending up with significantly less due to inflation or, worse, getting nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds. Accepting now ensures I get a fair share before the value drops further."
