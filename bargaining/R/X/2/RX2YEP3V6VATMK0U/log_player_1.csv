"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 in this round is equivalent to $3,200 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to accept a compromise. I'll take Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
