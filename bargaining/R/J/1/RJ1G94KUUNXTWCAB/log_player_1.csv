I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  While it's a pretty hefty advantage, I want to see if Bob is willing to accept it right away, or if he'll try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure how much longer Bob will continue to negotiate.  Inflation is a real threat, and I don't want to risk losing out on a significant portion of the money.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest choice at this point."
