"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm essentially losing 100,000$ compared to the 50/50 split I proposed earlier. On the other hand, Bob's offer is a bit more skewed towards him, but it's still a decent offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation is still 0% for me, I'll try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 50,000$ compared to the initial 50/50 split, and decreasing Bob's share by the same amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm essentially losing 100,000$ compared to the 50/50 split I proposed earlier. However, Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him than before, with him gaining 50,000$ more than me.

Considering the inflation is now affecting Bob's share, making it worth 14.26% less than the initial 600,000$, his actual gain is now 550,000 / 0.85874 ≈ 640,000.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation is still 0% for me, I'll try to get an even better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 50,000$ compared to my previous offer, and decreasing Bob's share by the same amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm essentially getting 500,000$ in real terms, which is a decent amount.

However, considering the inflation is now affecting Bob's share, making it worth 22.62% less than the initial 600,000$, his actual gain is now 500,000 / 0.77738 ≈ 644,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
