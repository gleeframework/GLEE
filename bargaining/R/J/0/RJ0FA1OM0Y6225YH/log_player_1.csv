At this point, I'm trying to minimize the losses due to inflation. While Bob is gaining more in each round, I need to make sure I get something. This offer is closer to Bob's previous offer and might be more appealing than rejecting again and facing even higher inflation in the next round."

I am accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation is extremely high now, and I risk getting even less in the next round if I reject.  It's better to take something than nothing at this point."
