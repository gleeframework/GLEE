"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself, considering the impact of inflation on the money's value. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a relatively fair split. The message is to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the fact that the money loses value over time. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the upcoming inflation impacts us differently. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money's value decreases with each round, accepting $4,000, which is worth 5% less now, doesn't seem like the best option. I initially offered Bob $4,000, and now he's offering me the same amount, which is worth less due to inflation. I think I can make a better proposal in the next round to maximize my gain. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4,200 and keep $5,800 for myself. Given the increasing impact of inflation, where the money's value decreases by 5% for me and 20% for Bob in each round, this split seems more reasonable. The message aims to highlight the urgency and fairness of this proposal, encouraging Bob to accept before the money loses even more value. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
