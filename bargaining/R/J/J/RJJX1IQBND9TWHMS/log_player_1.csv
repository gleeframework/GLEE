"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split. I'm confident that Bob will accept, as even with inflation, he gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  While Bob's gains are inflated, mine are not. I'm willing to wait for my turn to propose again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering an 8000/2000 split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm confident this one will be more appealing. I'm willing to lower my share slightly, but I don't want to go lower than 8000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation is really starting to hurt Bob. This is the best I can do without risking him rejecting my offer. Accepting this ensures I get something."
