Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This accounts for the decreasing value of the money with each round, and hopefully we can reach a quick and fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500
