"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's just split it now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too optimistic, I'll take a majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the majority of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to negotiate a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight majority, but I'm not going to let you take all the money!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slight majority, but still trying to maintain a reasonable balance. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a bigger majority again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. The consolation prize of 3000 is too small compared to the amount Bob is taking, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to negotiate a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller majority, but I need a more reasonable split!""
}

# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money, you can have a tiny share 
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take an even bigger majority. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. The tiny share of 1500 is not worth the large majority Bob is taking, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to negotiate a more balanced split."

Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
