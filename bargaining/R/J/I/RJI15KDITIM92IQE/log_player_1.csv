"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my thinking considering the inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer. The 50/50 split is actually a good deal for me, as it gives me 50% of the remaining value, which is worth 10% less than the initial $100.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
