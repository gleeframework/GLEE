"Round 1

``` 

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and leaving 100,000 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small portion to consider while allowing me to secure a significant majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer for Bob to 300,000, as it's clear he's not going to accept a low offer. This keeps a significant portion for me while acknowledging that a fairer split is needed to get a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. With the inflation we've seen, it's becoming increasingly likely that we'll both end up with nothing if we don't come to an agreement.  A fair split is the best way to secure something for both of us."
