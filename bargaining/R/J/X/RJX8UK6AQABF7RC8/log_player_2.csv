Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  A 50/50 split is the only way to guarantee a win-win scenario in the long run.  Inflation is biting, and any further delay risks both of us losing a significant amount.  Let's reach a compromise before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
