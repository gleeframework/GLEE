"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. The idea is to start with a slightly biased offer that still leaves room for compromise, while also taking into account the fact that the value of the money decreases for Bob with each passing round. By framing it as a ""fair"" offer, I'm trying to set the tone for a cooperative negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to start 60-40, but I think a more even split is fair considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's right that inflation is a factor, his proposed split of 40-60 in his favor doesn't take into account that the inflation only affects him, not me. Given that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I see no reason to accept a less favorable split than what I initially proposed. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean I'm giving in too quickly, potentially leaving value on the table. By rejecting, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further and potentially find a more mutually acceptable split. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering your concerns about inflation, I'm willing to make a slight concession. However, I still believe a split in my favor is fair given the circumstances.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slight concession to Bob by reducing my proposed gain from 60 to 58, while also acknowledging his concerns about inflation. By doing so, I'm showing that I'm willing to listen to his perspective and find a compromise, while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. The message is designed to convey a sense of flexibility and cooperation, while also reiterating my belief that a split in my favor is fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the small concession, but it's still not enough to offset the inflation. This offer reflects a balance closer to what's fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's right that inflation is taking a bigger bite out of his share, his proposed split of 45-55 in his favor still doesn't account for the fact that the inflation only affects him. Given that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'm not willing to accept a less favorable split than what I initially proposed. Additionally, Bob's offer doesn't seem to take into account the fact that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him - by 48.8% already! By rejecting, I'm signaling that I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't be swayed by emotional appeals to ""fairness"" that don't take into account the actual numbers. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I understand the impact of inflation on your share, but I'm not willing to compromise too much. This is my revised offer, considering the current situation.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a very slight concession to Bob by reducing my proposed gain from 58 to 57, while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. Given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for Bob, I'm not willing to make significant concessions. By now, the money is worth almost 50% less to Bob than it was in the first round, which means that every dollar he gets is worth less and less. My message is designed to convey a sense of understanding for Bob's situation, while also reiterating my unwillingness to compromise too much. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the halfway point, and it's important we reach a deal soon. This offer acknowledges the inflation while still providing a reasonable split for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, at this point, the money is worth a staggering 67.23% less to him than it was in the first round. This means that his proposed split of 48-52 in his favor is actually much more lopsided in my favor than it appears on the surface. Given that the money is still worth the same to me as in the first round, I'm not willing to accept a split that doesn't reflect the rapidly decreasing value of the money for Bob. By rejecting, I'm signaling that I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't be swayed by emotional appeals to ""reasonableness"" that don't take into account the actual numbers. Let's see what the next round brings!

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm making a slight concession to Bob by reducing my proposed gain from 57 to 56, while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. Given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for Bob, I'm not willing to make significant concessions. By now, the money is worth over 67% less to Bob than it was in the first round, which means that every dollar he gets is worth less and less. My message is designed to convey a sense of understanding for Bob's situation, while also reiterating my unwillingness to compromise too much. I'm also hinting that time is running out, and we need to reach a deal soon.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now. The inflation is eating away at the value, and this is the most equitable solution given the circumstances.  Let's split it evenly and avoid getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, at this point, the money is worth a staggering 79.03% less to him than it was in the first round. This means that his proposed 50-50 split is actually extremely favorable to me, as my half of the money is still worth the same as in the first round, while his half is worth less than a quarter of its original value. By rejecting, I'm signaling that I'm willing to take a hard line and try to get an even better deal, given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for Bob. Let's see what the next round brings!

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm making a slight concession to Bob by reducing my proposed gain from 56 to 55, while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. Given the extremely low value of the money for Bob, I'm not willing to make significant concessions. By now, the money is worth less than 21% of its original value to Bob, which means that every dollar he gets is almost worthless. My message is designed to convey a sense of finality and urgency, hinting that this is my last reasonable offer before I start making more extreme demands.
