Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your concerns about inflation, I'm willing to make a slight concession. However, I still believe a split in my favor is fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the small concession, but it's still not enough to offset the inflation. This offer reflects a balance closer to what's fair given the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation on your share, but I'm not willing to compromise too much. This is my revised offer, considering the current situation. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation, the offer is barely budging. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the initial value due to inflation. I need to push for a more substantial change in the split to make up for the decreasing value of the money over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the halfway point, and it's important we reach a deal soon. This offer acknowledges the inflation while still providing a reasonable split for both of us.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make a small concession, but we need to reach a deal soon. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is using time pressure, but her offer is still not good enough. The small increase doesn't nearly compensate for the accelerating inflation. I need to hold firm and emphasize the urgency of a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now. The inflation is eating away at the value, and this is the most equitable solution given the circumstances.  Let's split it evenly and avoid getting nothing.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to go for a 50/50 split.  We are past the halfway point, and the rapidly increasing inflation means any further delay heavily favors Alice.  A firm, but fair offer is needed to encourage her to settle before we both lose out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final reasonable offer. Take it or risk getting much less. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this is likely the best offer I can get at this point. The round 8 rejection of a 50/50 split shows Alice is willing to push her advantage. Accepting now secures something, whereas continued rejection risks getting even less as inflation eats away at my potential gains. It's a bitter pill, but better than nothing in round 12."
