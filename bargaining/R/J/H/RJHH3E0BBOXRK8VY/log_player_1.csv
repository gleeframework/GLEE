This offer gives me a larger share, as I have no reason to assume that Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share, it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate and is offering an equal split now. Since I gain nothing from rejecting this offer and continuing to the next round, it's in my best interest to accept."
