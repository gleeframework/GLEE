"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split, taking into account the diminishing value of the money over time. Let's work together to get the most out of this opportunity. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

Alice's gain: $855,000 (90% of $950,000, which is 95% of $900,000)
Bob's gain: $810,000 (80% of $1,000,000, which is 80% of $1,250,000)

Bob's proposal is more favorable to me than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best we can get. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is better than mine, but I'm not sure if we can do better. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 95% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to make this worthwhile. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a more aggressive split, with me getting 70% of the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation:

Bob's offer is more favorable to me than his previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best we can get. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not convinced it's the best we can do. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
