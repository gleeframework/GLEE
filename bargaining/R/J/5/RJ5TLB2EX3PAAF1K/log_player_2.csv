"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not satisfied with that offer. It's a huge imbalance, and the money is worth less every round. I'll wait for my chance to propose a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, taking into account the diminishing value of the money over time. Let's work together to get the most out of this opportunity.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to make this worthwhile. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than before, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation factor. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I've adjusted my offer slightly. Let's find a split that acknowledges the inflation and ensures we both get a decent share of the diminishing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it still heavily favors her. I'm not comfortable accepting a deal where the inflation is causing such a significant disparity. I believe we can find a more equitable solution."

{""bob_gain"": 380000, ""alice_gain"": 620000, ""message"": ""I've considered the inflation and tried to meet you halfway. Let's find a solution that respects both our needs and accounts for the diminishing value of the money.""}
