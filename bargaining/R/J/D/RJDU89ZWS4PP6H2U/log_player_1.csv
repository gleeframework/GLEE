"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. This is a generous offer, considering I could have taken 50-50 or even 60-40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you more, but I want a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the original value, which is $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $600,000, which is worth $570,000 after inflation.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering I could have taken $700,000 in the first round. However, I'm not sure if Bob will offer a better deal in the next round.

I'll reject this offer for now and see what Bob has to offer next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the previous value, which is $570,000.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal than the previous ones:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a slightly better deal for me, considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up, I want more than 50%. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 85.74% of the original value, which is $1,000,000 * 0.8574 = $857,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $450,000, which is worth $385,770 after inflation.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'd be getting significantly less than what I proposed in previous rounds. I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 85.74% of the previous value, which is $385,770.

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
