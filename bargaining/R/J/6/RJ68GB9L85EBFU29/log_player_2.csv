"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split seems fair at the start, I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself.  Let's see if I can get Alice to budge a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a better reflection of our equal contributions.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but your offer wasn't appealing considering the inflation. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a higher percentage, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's take this offer and move on."
