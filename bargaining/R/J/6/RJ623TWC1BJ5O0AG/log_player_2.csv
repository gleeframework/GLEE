I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair split, I know I can potentially get more if I hold out and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is taking advantage of inflation, and even though her offer is better than what she offered in Round 1, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject and see if she's willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share due to inflation, but still giving you a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While Alice's offer is becoming increasingly lopsided due to inflation, I'm going to accept this offer. It's better than the last round, and we're getting close to the deadline. I want to ensure that we both get something before it's too late."
