Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is working against you, but your last offer wasn't fair to me. Let's split it 62/38. This gives me a slight edge, but still leaves you with a decent share considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62
