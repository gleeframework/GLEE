**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a bit longer.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting Alice more:** The value of the money is decreasing faster for Alice. Every round that Bob rejects an offer increases the pressure on Alice to settle.
* **Bob has time:** There are still several rounds left. While waiting too long is risky, Bob can likely secure a better deal by being patient for another round or two.

**Important Note:** Bob needs to be careful. If he pushes too hard and doesn't start accepting offers soon, he risks getting nothing."
