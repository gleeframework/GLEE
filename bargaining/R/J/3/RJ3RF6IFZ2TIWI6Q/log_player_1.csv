"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for future inflation. Let's be reasonable and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the inflation factor and Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the loss. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55/45 split, considering the inflation. I'll counter with a 65/35 split.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor and my previous rejection, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a higher share to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share this time to avoid further back and forth. Let's settle on a 40/60 split. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised offer, taking into account the increased inflation factor. Since the money is worth 27.1% less now, I'll aim to get an even higher share to compensate for the loss. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the 40/60 split, considering the inflation. I'll counter with a 50/50 split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant inflation factor and my previous rejections, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Since I'm getting desperate, I'll aim for a higher share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, but I need a significant majority of the remaining value. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
