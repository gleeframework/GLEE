"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Since the money is now worth less, I should aim to get more of it to compensate for the loss in value.

However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable proposal, especially considering the risk of inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
