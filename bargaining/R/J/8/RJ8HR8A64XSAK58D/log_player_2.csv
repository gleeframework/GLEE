Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I agree we should settle soon, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. Let's try 56-44.

``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 44/56 split at this stage is better than risking getting a much lower amount, or even nothing, in the later rounds as inflation eats into the potential winnings.
