"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original $100, which is $20. I'm keeping the remaining 80% for myself, which is $80. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll get as a result of this offer:

$70 * 0.95 (95% of the original value) = $66.50

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```

I'm offering Bob 25% of the original $100, which is $25, and keeping 75% for myself, which is $75. This offer is a bit more aggressive than my previous one, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 72 
# Bob gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation factor, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll get as a result of this offer:

$72 * 0.854 (94.74% of the original value) = $61.55

Considering this, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer. It's a good deal, and I'm getting a decent amount considering the inflation factor.
