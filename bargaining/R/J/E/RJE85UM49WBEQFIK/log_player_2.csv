"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, and we can always adjust in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm looking for a better deal!  I'll propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation will affect me more than you in the future rounds. Let's start with this, and we can adjust later if needed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects you more, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split in your favor. Let's compromise at 55/45. This keeps the split relatively even while acknowledging the inflation effect. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we continue to disagree."
