"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, we both get a good share, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'm not sure if I should accept this even split, considering I'll be losing 10% of my potential gain with each round. But, I also don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
