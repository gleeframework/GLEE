"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's end it here! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $700,000 is now worth $700,000 * 0.95 = $665,000.

Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.
