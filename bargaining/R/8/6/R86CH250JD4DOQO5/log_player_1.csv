"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a fair deal, let's split the money evenly. We both benefit more if we reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed, and I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is a ""fair deal"" for me. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to 20% inflation in each of the two rounds), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""This is a reasonable offer, don't be greedy, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000, which is a bit more than half of the remaining value of the money. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him!"
