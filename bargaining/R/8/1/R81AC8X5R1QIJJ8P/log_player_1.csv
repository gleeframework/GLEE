Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's a good deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest.  Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIt seems that Bob is not taking into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less for me in this round. I will reject this offer and make a new proposal that takes the inflation into account.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 58-42 is a fair split.""}\n\nPlease relay this message to Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, I think accepting this offer is the best option. The money is now worth 48.8% less for me than in the first round, so getting 40 is a better deal than the alternatives. I'll take it.\n\nGame over, I presume?"
