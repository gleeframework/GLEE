I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a risky move, but I think it's worth a shot to see if Bob is willing to accept a less-than-ideal offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  

* **Inflation:** My potential gains are worth 10% less than in the first round. Continuing to reject offers could result in even lower gains in the future.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering Bob's offer is worth 20% less to him than in the first round. 

It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing later."
