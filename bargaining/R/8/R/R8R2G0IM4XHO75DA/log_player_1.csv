"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have equal say in this.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since we both started with an equal stake. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is closer to my initial offer, but still takes into account Bob's suggestion of a more equal split."
