"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55, you get 45. It's a better deal for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that this is a better deal for both of us in the long run. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that gives me a slightly better share, considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, considering the inflation effect and the fact that the money is worth less now. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and it's a good starting point for future negotiations."
