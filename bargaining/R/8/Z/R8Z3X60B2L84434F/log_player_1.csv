"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's taking a larger share, and I'm only getting $3,000. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not giving up too much""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,000 and Bob gets $6,000. I'm trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding onto a decent amount of money."
