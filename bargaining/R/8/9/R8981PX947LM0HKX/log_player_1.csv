"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a small share to keep things interesting.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50, and Bob's gain of $50 is actually worth $40.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best strategy, considering the inflation rates. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject the offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me, so my gain is worth 4.375 ($47.50 * 0.95) and Bob's gain is worth 36 ($40 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting too generous yet.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $45 and Bob gets $55. My message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept a slightly more favorable deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to the end, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $40 is worth $34.16 (initial $100 * 0.95^3 * 0.95).
Bob's gain of $60 is worth $31.20 (initial $100 * 0.8 * 0.9 * 0.9).

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation or if he's genuinely trying to make a deal. I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject the offer for now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet.""

Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $30 is worth $23.36 (initial $100 * 0.95^4 * 0.95).
Bob's gain of $70 is worth $14.14 (initial $100 * 0.3 * 0.9 * 0.85 * 0.85).

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me or if he's genuinely trying to make a deal. I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject the offer for now.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 7, the money is worth 5% less for me, so my gain is worth 22.18 ($23.36 * 0.95) and Bob's gain is worth 13.35 ($14.14 * 0.95).

Here's my new offer:

```
{

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking the majority now 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $15 is worth $10.47 (initial $100 * 0.95^5 * 0.95 * 0.95).
Bob's gain of $85 is worth $1.71 (initial $100 * 0.2 * 0.9 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85).

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation or if he's genuinely trying to make a deal. I'll have to think carefully.

However, considering the extremely low value of my gain, I'll accept the offer to avoid getting even less.
