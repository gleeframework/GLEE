"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate. I'll take the whole $100 if you agree.""
}
```

This is a bold opening move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a quick start!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, and I'll give you a chance to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 60-40 split, especially considering the money I gain is worth 20% less than before. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle. Let's split it 50-50 and avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money I gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Your turn to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before, I still think I can do better. The money I gain is worth significantly less now due to inflation, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Let's see if this works for you.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I still want to ensure I get a decent amount, considering the decreasing value of the money I gain."
