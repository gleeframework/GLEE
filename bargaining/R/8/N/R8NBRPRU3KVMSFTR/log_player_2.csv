""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 60/40 split.  This reflects the fact that the money devalues faster for me, making each round more critical for me than for you.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I still need a significant share to account for the devaluation.  Let's split it 65/35. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us before the money becomes completely worthless.

# Alice gain: 650000
