"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's a very uneven split, Alice. Let's be more realistic. I propose we take the larger share this time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money closer to 60/40 this time.  I'll take the larger share, but we both get a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is working against me much faster than it is against her. It's better to hold out for a slightly better deal, as the value of her offers will plummet in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. Time is running out, and the value is shrinking fast. This is a fair split considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's split the remaining amount evenly and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The money is losing value fast, especially for Alice.  Every round that passes makes her previous offers (which were more favorable to her) look increasingly appealing in retrospect. 
* **Risk of Getting Nothing:** Holding out for a better deal is risky. If we don't reach an agreement, we both walk away with nothing.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not what I aimed for initially, is fair under these circumstances. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable share before the value deteriorates further."
