4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite ungenerous.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This considers the time value of money with the ongoing inflation.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I understand you want more, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with 60/40. I think 60/40 is too far in your favor considering we're both losing value due to inflation.  Let's split it 60/40 with the majority going to me as I'm taking the greater risk with inflation.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this back-and-forth isn't productive. I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's split the difference - 55% for me and 45% for you.  This accounts for the inflation disadvantage you're facing while still being fair.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's cut the drama.  We're both losing money with every round.  A 50/50 split is the most fair way to move forward from here, considering inflation and our need to reach an agreement.",Alice,5,
