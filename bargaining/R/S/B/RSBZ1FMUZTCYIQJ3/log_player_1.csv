"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that you proposed a 40/60 split last round. Let's try this! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's fair, but I'm not so sure. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer I made.""
}
```"
