Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is less than ideal, with each round the value of the money I receive keeps decreasing. It's better to accept this offer and secure at least some of the money."
