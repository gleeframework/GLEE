"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair division, with me getting a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a bit more, but that's a bit too high for me.  How about this? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he has acknowledged my desire for a bit more, his counteroffer still doesn't meet my expectations. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI've decided to make a new offer that's closer to the middle ground between our previous proposals. I'll take $58 and offer Bob $42. My message suggests that this is a compromise between our previous offers, and I hope Bob will find it more acceptable. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. At this point, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so it's better to secure $50 now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
