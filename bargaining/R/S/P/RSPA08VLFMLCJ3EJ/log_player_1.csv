"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the 20% devaluation of the money I gain, I'd rather not settle for a smaller share.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger either, but I'm not giving in yet 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Considering the significant devaluation, I'll think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth so much less, I'll have to be more cautious.

However, I'll consider this offer. With the 48.8% devaluation, $580,000 is not as bad as it sounds. I'll accept this offer.
