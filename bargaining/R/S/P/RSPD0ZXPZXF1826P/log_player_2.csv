Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I've moved a bit closer to your offer, acknowledging your attempt at compromise. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making small concessions, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a larger share than she's currently offering."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm sticking to a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - I'd rather lose everything than be nickel-and-dimed by you.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power play.  By sticking firmly to a 50/50 split and using strong language, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to walk away from the table. This might make Alice reconsider her negotiating tactics and offer a more reasonable deal. If she doesn't budge,  I'm still in a decent position to negotiate a better deal in later rounds, even with the impact of inflation."
