"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. 10% is too low, and I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially knowing about the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 55/45.  I think it's fair considering we both have to agree on it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40.  This gives you a larger share than the last round and I'm willing to take a smaller portion. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While it's still not ideal, it's a significant improvement over the last round and with the risk of further inflation, it's a good deal for me."
