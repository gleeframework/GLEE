"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. Given the rules of the game and the impact of inflation, starting with a slightly higher offer for myself allows room for negotiation while also being mindful of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to consider the offer positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's be reasonable. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation and the fact that Bob's offer still gives him a larger share despite the decreasing value, I reject this offer. The difference in the rate of inflation (20% for me vs. 10% for Bob) means that with each round, I am disproportionately affected by the delay in reaching an agreement. Thus, I aim to either negotiate a better deal that compensates for this imbalance or wait for an opportunity to propose a division that better reflects the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nIn this offer, I take into account the inflation from the previous rounds and propose a division that slightly favors me but is closer to an equal split than before. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for me, I aim to find a balance that is fair considering the current state of the game. The message emphasizes the need to find a middle ground that both parties can accept, especially under the pressure of ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's the best you'll get considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's message indicating this is his final offer, I decide to accept. The difference in the inflation rate has increasingly disadvantaged me with each round, and the risk of further devaluation outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating for a slightly better deal. Accepting this offer secures a certain amount now rather than risking a worse outcome due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
