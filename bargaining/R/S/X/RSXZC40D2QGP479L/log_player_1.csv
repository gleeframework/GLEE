This is a tough choice, but Alice has been consistent in rejecting offers that give her less than 20, and she clearly values getting *something* over accepting a deal that would leave her with nothing. While this means Alice and Bob will both end up with nothing, it showcases her strong negotiation style and unwillingness to cave to pressure."
