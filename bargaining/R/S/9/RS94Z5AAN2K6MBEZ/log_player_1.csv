Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep 9000 dollars for myself and give 1000 to Bob. This gives me a good starting point and leaves some room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer is better than getting nothing, it's still drastically lower than my previous offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still hoping to get a good chunk of the money. The inflation is seriously hurting me, and I need to secure a deal soon.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I get something substantial."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are steadily getting worse, and the inflation is severely impacting my share. I'll reject this offer and try to secure a better deal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

The inflation is hitting hard. I'm willing to compromise and lower my offer to 6500, hoping Bob will see it's better than nothing for him. I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I have to accept.  Even though inflation has taken a significant toll, getting 5000 is better than nothing at this point. It's a shame to lose so much, but with only a few rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high."
