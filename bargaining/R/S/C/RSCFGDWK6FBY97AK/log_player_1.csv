"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer for Bob. I want to see if he's willing to settle quickly or if he thinks he can get more.  This gives me a chance to assess his risk appetite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is still quite generous.  I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more to his inflated gains."
