"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's try to find a more optimal split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gains are worth 10% less, so I need to be careful with the numbers.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, but I'll consider it. Since the message suggests Bob is open to negotiation, I'll try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about 50-50, but I'm willing to compromise. How about 55-45 in my favor?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my gains are worth 10% less again.

I'll make a new offer, trying to balance between being fair and getting a decent share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a better share to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains. I need to be careful with the numbers.

I'm not thrilled about the 52-48 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I think this is a fair split. I'm willing to accept 52-48 in your favor.""
}
```

I'm hoping this will be the final round!"
