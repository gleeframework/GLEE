Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a 90/10 split.  While the money is worth less to me each round, I believe this is a fair compromise to reach an agreement quickly.

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
