"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, Alice, but this split considers the time pressure we're both under.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is ticking, Bob. This offer is a good compromise, let's not be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer gives us both a reasonable share considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still on the table. It's better to secure a win now than risk getting nothing later. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but still rejectable. While time pressure is mounting, and Alice is sticking to her guns, accepting this offer means I lose almost 60% of the potential value compared to round 1. There's still a chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is the same offer I made before. It's clear we both want a larger share, but we need to be realistic about the time remaining. Let's end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be serious.  This offer is the most balanced one you'll get at this point. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The rate of inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds. Alice is unlikely to budge further, and the risk of losing everything is too high now."
