"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  I understand the inflation pressure, but this needs to be fair for both of us to agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer significantly undervalues my position given the time pressure from inflation. I'm proposing a compromise - let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is trying to make it seem like she's compromising. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. We need to push her closer to a more even split while keeping in mind that time is on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but we're running out of time. This offer is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer to highlight the increasing fairness in my favor as time progresses. My offer now reflects a slight advantage for me, which is justified given the inflation working against her.  This puts the ball in her court and applies further pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a small concession for you to agree quickly, as time is literally money for me. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure now. While she calls it a ""small concession,""  the difference between her offer in round 3 and round 5 is significant, reflecting the impact of inflation on her side.  She's trying to rush me into accepting, but I can still push for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out for both of us, but it's clear the pressure is on you. I'm offering a deal that reflects this reality. Let's close this out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** I'm increasing the pressure by highlighting the dwindling time and emphasizing the impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm offering a small concession from my last offer,  showing a willingness to negotiate but maintaining a firm position. This makes it seem like this is the best deal she'll get, especially as time ticks away.
* **Aiming for Agreement:**  We're getting close to a point where Alice's potential gain will be significantly eroded by inflation if she continues to refuse.  This offer is designed to be enticing enough for her to accept while still securing a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.  Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally cracking under the pressure of inflation. While a 50/50 split wasn't my ideal outcome, it's still a good deal considering the circumstances. Accepting now guarantees a significant sum, whereas continuing the game risks Alice panicking and offering even less favorable terms, or even reaching a point where the deal is no longer worthwhile for me."
