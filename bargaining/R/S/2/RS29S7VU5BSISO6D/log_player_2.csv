Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to significantly eat into Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob still receives a significant sum:

* **Round 1 Ideal:** $400,000 (and no loss from inflation)
* **Round 5 Offer:** $420,000 (but with 18.55% inflation already applied)

Rejecting carries huge risk:

* **Another Rejection:** Alice is clearly content to wait, meaning Bob's position only worsens.
* **Round 6 Offer:** Likely to be even worse, as Alice knows Bob is becoming desperate. 

While taking the $420,000 stings, it's the most rational choice given the game's rules and Alice's stubborn (but clever) strategy."
