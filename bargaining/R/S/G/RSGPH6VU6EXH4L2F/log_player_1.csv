"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm not sure if Bob will agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I want more for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting! My gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I'm getting less than I initially proposed, but Bob is also getting less than he initially proposed. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a bit more, but not too greedy. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""A slight improvement, but still a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, no more negotiating 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! My gain is worth a significant 14.26% less than in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to meet him halfway. I was hoping to get a bit more, but at this point, a 50/50 split seems reasonable. I'll think about it...
