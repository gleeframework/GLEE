"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  You get 40% and I'll take the remaining 60%. This way we both get a good chunk of the money, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
