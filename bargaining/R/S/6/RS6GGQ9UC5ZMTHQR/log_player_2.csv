"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal.  Let's try 58/42, and we can finally get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me more significantly than her. It's still too early to settle for an offer where I receive significantly less.  I need to incentivize her to settle quickly."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4600,

""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this situation, and it's disappearing quickly.  This is my final offer, let's wrap this up and both walk away with something substantial.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's meet in the middle and split it 55/45.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, this is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. The rate of inflation is heavily impacting my potential gains, and waiting any longer significantly risks ending up with nothing. Accepting Alice's offer now ensures I at least receive a reasonable portion of the initial amount."
