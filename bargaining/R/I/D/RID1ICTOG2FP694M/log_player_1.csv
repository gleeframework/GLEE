"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 55% is a fair share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

After considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than the first one, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50-50""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and equal division of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the risk I'm taking 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still not in my favor. I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I'm getting less value out of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think my risk-taking deserves a larger reward 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still not in my favor. I'm getting less value out of the money, and the 35-65 split is not acceptable to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to get a bit worried about the time running out!"
