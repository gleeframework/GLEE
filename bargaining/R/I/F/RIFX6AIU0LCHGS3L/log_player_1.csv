"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have the smaller share this time, but I'll get a bigger one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up a bigger share, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that the offer is fair, and I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial offer and still getting a decent amount myself."
