Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob. I need to see some flexibility on your end. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to frame her offer as a compromise, it's important to remember the inflation working against her.  She's feeling the pressure to make a deal. Holding out for a better offer in the next round or two is still the better strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is more than fair considering the time pressure. I'm standing firm on this one.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The goal here is to convey firmness while still offering a deal that could be tempting for Alice given the circumstances.  By round 6, the shrinking pot is likely weighing heavily on her decision-making."
