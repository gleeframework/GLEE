"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rate difference.""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, considering the inflation rate difference between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to ensure I get a good portion too, given the inflation rates.   
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm willing to negotiate further. I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining amount. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to prioritize my own gains due to the inflation rate difference.""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob receives $4,000. I'm trying to find a balance between being reasonable and protecting my own interests."
