Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that the value of the money decreases for me over time. Even though her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal, even if it means risking more inflation."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I might get in later rounds if Alice continues to lowball me. Accepting now cuts my losses and guarantees me something."
