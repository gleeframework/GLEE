Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer her a smaller share, hoping to get a larger share myself.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll need to adjust my expectations. Alice's offer is still a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer. I'll accept this one.
