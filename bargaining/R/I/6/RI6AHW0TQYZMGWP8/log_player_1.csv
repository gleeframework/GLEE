Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a tough start. Let's be realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. Take this offer now, otherwise the value decreases for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
