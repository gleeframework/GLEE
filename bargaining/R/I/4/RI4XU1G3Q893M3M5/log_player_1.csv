"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take $100,000 and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. It's a good starting point for a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 20% less than before, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving up 60% of the remaining money, especially with the value of the money decreasing over time. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money decreasing by 20% each round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share. Take $300,000 and let's see if we can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a bit less than his previous offer, but I'm keeping a larger share of the remaining money to account for the decreasing value of the dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the decreasing value of the money, I think splitting it down the middle might not be the best deal for me. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'll need to be careful not to wait too long, as the value of the money will continue to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""alice_gain"": 850000,

  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal. Take $150,000 and let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm keeping a larger share of the remaining money to account for the decreasing value of the dollars."

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining amount. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'll need to be careful not to wait too long, as the value of the money will continue to decrease."

}
```

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'm running out of options. Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one. I'll accept his offer from Round 8:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $300,000 and hope it's enough to make it worthwhile, considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money."
