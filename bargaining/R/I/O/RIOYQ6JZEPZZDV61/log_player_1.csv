Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly even split, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is a serious factor.  Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
