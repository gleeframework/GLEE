"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I would gain $40, which is equivalent to $32 in the first round's value. Since the money is worth 20% less, I would gain $32 / 0.8 = $40 in the first round's value.

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less each round, so 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64), I need to take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need some for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, giving me $32 and Bob $68."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still not satisfied with the deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I gain in the first round's value. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I need to divide $30 by 0.5184 (1 - 0.4816) to get the equivalent value in the first round.

$30 / 0.5184 ≈ $57.81

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 61.568% less due to inflation (20% less each round, so 0.8^4 = 0.4096), I need to take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25-75 split, giving me $25 and Bob $75."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 22 
# Bob gain: 78 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I gain in the first round's value. Since the money I gain is worth 67.23% less due to inflation, I need to divide $22 by 0.3267 (1 - 0.6733) to get the equivalent value in the first round.

$22 / 0.3267 ≈ $67.27

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.
