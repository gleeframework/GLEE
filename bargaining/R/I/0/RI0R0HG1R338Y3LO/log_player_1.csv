"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too hard.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, now I'll try to get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a bit more in his favor.

I'll have to be careful with the inflation, though. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll have to consider the effective difference in value.

Let's calculate the effective gain for both of us:

My gain: 400,000 * 0.95 (5% less due to inflation) = 380,000
Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.9 (10% less due to inflation) = 540,000

With these values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a 55/45 split.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a bigger share, I'll meet you halfway.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You met me halfway, now I'll try to push it further. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to push the split even further in his favor.

Let's calculate the effective gain for both of us, considering the inflation:

My gain: 300,000 * 0.855 (14.26% less due to inflation) = 256,500
Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.727 (27.1% less due to inflation) = 508,900

With these values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable split for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a 60/40 split.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing too hard, let's find a more reasonable balance.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not there yet. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still pushing for a larger share.

Let's calculate the effective gain for both of us, considering the inflation:

My gain: 250,000 * 0.777 (22.62% less due to inflation) = 194,250
Bob's gain: 750,000 * 0.591 (40.95% less due to inflation) = 444,075

With these values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is making a strong push for a larger share.

Let's calculate the effective gain for both of us, considering the inflation:

My gain: 200,000 * 0.697 (30.17% less due to inflation) = 139,400
Bob's gain: 800,000 * 0.475 (52.17% less due to inflation) = 380,000

With these values, I'll decide:

```
