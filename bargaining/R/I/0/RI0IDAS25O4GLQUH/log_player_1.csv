"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I deserve a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. My message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, while also setting the tone for the negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want more, but this is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. The 20% decrease in value for me is significant, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a larger share. Additionally, Bob's offer of 45 for me is still relatively low, considering the initial amount was 100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the decreased value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. I'm still aiming for a slightly higher share, but trying to appear more reasonable and willing to compromise, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially with the inflation we're both facing. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me (48.8% less than the initial round) and the relatively smaller decrease for Bob (14.26% less), I believe a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise at this point. The inflation is taking a substantial toll on my potential gain, and I risk losing even more value if we continue to negotiate. Bob's offer seems fair, given the circumstances, so I'm willing to accept it and conclude the game."
