Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer because it's too close to an equal split, and I'd rather try to get more.
