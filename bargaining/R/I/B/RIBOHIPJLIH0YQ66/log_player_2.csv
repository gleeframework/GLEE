Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm Bob, and the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get more than 50%. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a little less than half, but I think this is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is offering me a bit more than half, I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, I want to try to get as much as possible. I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round. Maybe I can get an even better deal!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger risk due to inflation, so I think I deserve a bigger share.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. We can't keep going back and forth like this, let's end the game. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. The money is worth 18.55% less for me now, so getting 55% of the original amount is a good deal. I'll accept this offer and end the game. It's better to get something now than to risk getting less in the next round."
