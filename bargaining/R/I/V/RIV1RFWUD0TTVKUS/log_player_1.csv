"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less to Bob in subsequent rounds. This should incentivize him to accept, as he'll likely get a worse deal if he rejects and we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer, and the money is worth less to him. It is unlikely he'll get a better deal later on, and I'm sure I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still offering a more favorable deal for me.  After seeing Bob's proposal, I'm confident I can get a better deal than 100,000.  Since the money is worth less for Bob each round, it should be in his best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse for me than his last offer.  The money is worth considerably less to him now, and I'm confident I can do better than 200,000.  The inflation is really working in my favor at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm taking a slight hit to my share again, but I'm still confident I can secure a better deal for myself in the long run. With each passing round, Bob's situation gets worse due to inflation, while my losses are less significant. He should be motivated to accept this offer before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the money is worth significantly less for him. He is clearly in a desperate position now. I'm confident I can still get a much better deal for myself in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but still offering a considerable sum to Bob. With the inflation factor, this should be an appealing offer for him. He's losing a significant amount of value with each round, and it's getting more and more likely that he'll accept a deal that benefits me more."
