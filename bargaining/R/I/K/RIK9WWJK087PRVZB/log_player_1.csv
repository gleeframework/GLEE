"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's my turn again.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to split it evenly just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each passing round!

I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer. I'm getting a smaller share than in my previous offers, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal later.

Let's think about it...
