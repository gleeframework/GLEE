"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and simple proposal, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to start, but I think this will be a fairer deal in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation effect.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer. I think I can do better than 40% of the total amount, and I'm not convinced that this is a ""fairer deal in the long run"". I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the initial split was equal. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by giving Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial proposal, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference from the last offer and move forward. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation affecting Bob's share, but I'm willing to consider his compromise.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. The 50/50 split is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation. I'm willing to take the 4500 and move forward."
