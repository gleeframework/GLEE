Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'm curious to see what Alice proposes next."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the initial split was equal. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with the offer.  Even though I'm taking a hit from inflation, I believe I can get a better deal if we keep negotiating."
