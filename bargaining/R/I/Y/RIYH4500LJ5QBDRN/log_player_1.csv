"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm starting with a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain of 40 is worth less than my initial offer of 50. But Bob's gain of 60 is worth even less than that!

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the possibility of getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting hard! My gain of 35 is worth a lot less than my initial offer of 50, and even less than my offer of 45 in round 3.

However, I'm not sure if I want to take the risk of rejecting this offer, considering the significant decrease in value of the money. I'll have to think carefully...

After considering the risks, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 5, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.5
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly more aggressive approach, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! My gain of 30 is worth a lot less than my initial offer of 50, and even less than my previous offers.

However, I'm not sure if I want to take the risk of rejecting this offer, considering the significant decrease in value of the money. I'll have to think carefully...

After considering the risks, I'll decide to reject this offer.
