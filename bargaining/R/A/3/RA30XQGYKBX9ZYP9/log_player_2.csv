"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know the value decreases faster for you, so this offer gives you a good deal considering the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n###\nSince I'm Bob, I want to maximize my gain, and I believe I can get a better offer in the next rounds. Although the money's value decreases by 5% each round for me, I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get more than $450,000. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the 5% decrease in value for me, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'm willing to take a bit more than half to compensate for the loss in value.""}\n\n###\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money's value decreases for me but not for Alice. By offering her $475,000, I'm hoping she'll accept and we can end the game here. If not, I'll have to consider the decreasing value in my next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing for both of us. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure but still offering a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n###\nAlthough the value of the money is decreasing for me, I still think I can get a better offer. Alice's offer of $475,000 is not significantly better than my previous offer to her, considering the 9.75% decrease in value. I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 562500, ""alice_gain"": 437500, ""message"": ""Considering the 14.26% decrease in value for me, I believe this offer is reasonable. I'm taking a larger share to compensate for the loss in value, but still leaving a significant amount for Alice.""}\n\n###\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the increasing loss in value for me. By offering Alice $437,500, I'm hoping she'll accept and we can end the game here. If not, I'll have to consider the decreasing value in my next offer and try to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm offering a perfectly even split to end this now before inflation eats away at your share any further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n###\nConsidering the 18.55% decrease in value for me, an even split of $500,000 seems like a reasonable offer at this point. If I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the value of the money would decrease even further, potentially leading to a worse outcome. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game here, as I don't think I can get a significantly better deal in the next rounds."
