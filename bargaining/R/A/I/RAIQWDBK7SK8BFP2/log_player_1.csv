"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable proposal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the relative values.

I'm not too keen on splitting it 50/50, as I'd rather get a larger share. However, since the money is decreasing in value with each round, I'd rather accept this offer and get a larger share now rather than risking getting less in subsequent rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
