"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining money, considering the inflation will make it even harder to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting now!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think the offer is reasonable, and the risk of further inflation makes me want to take the deal. Bob's gain is getting closer to 60%, but I'll take the 40% and be done with it."
