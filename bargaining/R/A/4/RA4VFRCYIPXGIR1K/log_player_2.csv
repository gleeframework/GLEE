Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but my offer is still the most reasonable. Let's not waste more rounds, especially with the value decreasing for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
