"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is ""fair"" in the sense of a basic split, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting and making a counter-proposal in the next round gives Bob a chance to get a better deal as Alice's money will be worth less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I think a 65-35 split is a better reflection of our current situation. Inflation is a factor, and I believe this offer is more fair to both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's aim for a 54-46 split. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get a larger share, the inflation factor makes Alice's offer more attractive. The money I gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, and accepting this offer avoids the risk of further losses due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
