"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is a better reflection of our current situation. Inflation is a factor, and I believe this offer is more fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a bit aggressive. I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced a 65-35 split is fair, considering the initial offer was 60-40. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's aim for a 54-46 split.""
}
