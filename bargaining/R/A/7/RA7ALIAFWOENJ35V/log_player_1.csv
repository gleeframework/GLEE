"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the total amount, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'm now considering a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, taking 80% of the total amount. I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up that much.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
