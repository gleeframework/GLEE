Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 40-60 is not what I had in mind.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think 50-50 is a fair split. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting a bit desperate too! With the inflation taking a toll on my earnings, I'm starting to get worried about getting nothing if we don't make a deal soon. Considering Bob's offer, I think 50-50 is a reasonable compromise, especially since we're running out of rounds.
