"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you 40% since you were so generous with the 50/50 split. Let's see if we can agree on a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40% offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Let's try to find a compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground between my initial 50/50 offer and Bob's 40/60 offer."
