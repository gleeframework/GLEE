"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering I rejected your previous offer, and inflation will continue to devalue the money. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
