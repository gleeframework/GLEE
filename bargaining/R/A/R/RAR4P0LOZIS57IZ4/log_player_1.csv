With the inflation effect, my gain of $10,000 in this round is worth 43.12% less than the $6000 I would have gotten in the first round. But, I have to admit, this offer is a bit... generous.

I'll accept this offer and take all the money. I'm not sure if Bob is just trying to get out of the game or if he's really willing to give up, but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
