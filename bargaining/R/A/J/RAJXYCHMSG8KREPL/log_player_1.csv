I'm going for a pretty big chunk in the first round. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share initially to see how the game plays out.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is a bit insulting!  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time. The inflation has hit me harder than Bob, so I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I still want a good chunk of the money.  Let's see if he's more reasonable this time!"
