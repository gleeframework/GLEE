"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but your offer was too far. Let's split the difference and see if we can find a mutually agreeable outcome. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, it's still heavily in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation for Alice, waiting her out remains a strong tactic. There's a good chance she'll become more agreeable to a fairer split as the rounds progress."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but this needs to be a fair deal. The clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is moving slightly closer to Alice's offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure and decreasing value, encouraging Alice to make a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is still a significant improvement over Alice's previous offer and maintains a slight advantage for Bob considering the faster inflation rate on Alice's side."
