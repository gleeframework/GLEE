"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a balanced approach, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: $50 (as proposed)
Bob's gain: $50 / 0.8 = $62.50

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather have more money, considering the inflation effect. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll take that into account when making my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but it's still a good deal""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain: $45 (as proposed)
Bob's gain: $55 / 0.516 (since it's 100 - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value) = $106.86

I'll reject this offer because Bob's gain is worth significantly more than mine, considering the inflation effect. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to find a middle ground, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
