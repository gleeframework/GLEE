"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a 20% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 7/10 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was quite skewed towards him.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a 45% share of the remaining $1,000,000. I'm hoping this is more to his liking!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your middle ground is too low, I'll take 55% 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

With the reduced value of money, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be even more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was again skewed towards him.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $600,000, which is a 60% share of the remaining $1,000,000. I'm hoping this is the sweet spot that will finally get him to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80%, it's the least I deserve after your lowball offers 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gain!

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I don't want to risk going to another round. I'll accept his offer from round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $200,000, and we can finally put this game to rest!"
