# Alice gain: 200000

I don't think it's a good idea to accept an offer where I get only 20% of the total, while Bob gets 80%. I'd like to propose a better deal in the next round."

I'm not happy with this offer at all. The consolation prize of $100,000 is a significant drop from my previous offers, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll try to do better in the next round."

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. The $10,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to accept such a paltry sum. I'll try to do better in the next round."
