Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I propose a 50/50 split.  We both lose value each round, so let's find a solution where we both get something fair.  This offer avoids further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
