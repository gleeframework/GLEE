"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us receiving $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is fair considering we both stand to lose money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 40% difference in the split, but I understand Bob's concern about inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share than my initial offer."
