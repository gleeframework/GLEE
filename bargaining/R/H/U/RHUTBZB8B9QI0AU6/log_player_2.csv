Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. I think it's fair, and it avoids any potential for disagreement in future rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation affecting my share each round.  This offer is still quite fair to you. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
