I'm going to propose a 95/5 split in my favor. Since I get to propose first, I'm taking advantage of the initial power dynamic. However, I'm not being overly greedy, as I want to keep the game going and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal than a 5/95 split. I'll wait to see what Bob offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but still leaving Bob with something. I believe this offer is fair considering the inflation and that I'm willing to negotiate further."
