"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, let's get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of the money for now! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations! With the money worth 20% less, I'm not thrilled about the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're keeping a lot, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a bit more generous than the 50-50 split I proposed initially. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great trend so far! The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and Bob's offers are still quite lopsided.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal, but I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer."

  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
