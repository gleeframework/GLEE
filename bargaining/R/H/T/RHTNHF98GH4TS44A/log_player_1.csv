"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a roughly equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob!

Considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'd rather take the safer option.
