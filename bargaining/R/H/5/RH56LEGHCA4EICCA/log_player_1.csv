"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to take that into account.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split, which is closer to my desired 50-50 split, but still a bit more in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the money!

Considering that Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, but the money I gain is still worth the same, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

With this offer, I'd be getting a significant share of the money, but I'm not sure if it's enough to justify accepting, given the inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering that Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, but the money I gain is still worth the same, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

With this offer, I'd be getting a huge share of the money, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, given the inflation.

However, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
