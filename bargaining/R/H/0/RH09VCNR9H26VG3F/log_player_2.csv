"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer ensures you get a decent share now, and we both avoid losing value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's end this game.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, this offer is even better for you than your last round's offer considering the inflation. Let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is making things worse with each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, even if it's less than my initial goal."
