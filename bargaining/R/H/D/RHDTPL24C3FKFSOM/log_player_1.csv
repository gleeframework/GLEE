"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm assuming he'll value the opportunity to get anything at all in the first round, even if it's a relatively small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much more favorable deal for Bob. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round. Even with inflation, the value of my share will be much higher than the current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the inflation and the fact that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm willing to offer a bit more to Bob to try and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is much closer to what I initially proposed, it's still not acceptable. With the significant inflation affecting my share, I need to secure a significantly larger share to compensate. I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

Despite the increasing inflation, I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. However, I've adjusted my offer to reflect the increasing negotiation power Bob has gained. This offer should be more appealing to Bob than the previous ones, making it more likely he'll accept."
