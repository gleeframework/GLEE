"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more as I'm losing money to inflation each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is not unreasonable, it's best to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll try to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation you're facing. Let's end this quickly and get the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm losing money fast. Meet me in the middle - this is a fair offer considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to my initial position, and the time pressure is real.  It's better to accept and get something than risk getting nothing."
