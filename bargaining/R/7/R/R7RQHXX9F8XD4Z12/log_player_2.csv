"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob. This might seem generous, but remember, inflation will reduce the value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 3:1 ratio is tempting, it's better to see if Alice will budge. There are 12 rounds, and the money is worth less with each passing round. There's a good chance Alice will offer a more even split to avoid getting nothing in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the value of money will decrease in future rounds.  Let's reach an agreement and avoid losing money to inflation.""}
