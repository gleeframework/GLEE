"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to make the game more interesting and give him an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a different split. How about I take $475000 and you receive $525000? This way, we can both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $525,000 is now worth less than the original $475,000. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. I'll take 70% and you get 30%. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount, hoping to make the deal more appealing to him."
