Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're not going to agree on an uneven split.  Let's be practical and go for a 50/50 split. This way we both walk away with a significant amount, and we can finally finish this game.

# Alice gain: 500000

It's tempting to hold out for more, but Alice is right.  We're running out of rounds, and a 50/50 split ensures we both get a substantial amount. Better to take the sure thing than risk getting nothing!"
