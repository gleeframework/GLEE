I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair!  Even with the inflation, I'd rather take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer based on the inflation and Bob's previous response. I'm aiming for a more balanced split, but still trying to secure a majority share.  Let's see if this is more appealing to Bob."
