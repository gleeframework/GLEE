Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we're both losing some value with each round. Let's work together to get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
