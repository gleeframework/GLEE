""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise, but not to the extent you're proposing. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This reflects the inflation and still offers a decent amount for you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting longer means getting even less in real terms.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise slightly but is unlikely to agree to a drastically smaller share. 
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that Bob can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Alice might become even more assertive, further reducing Bob's potential gains.

**Taking the deal now secures Bob a reasonable amount, even though it's less than initially hoped for.  Delaying carries significant risk with diminishing returns.**"
