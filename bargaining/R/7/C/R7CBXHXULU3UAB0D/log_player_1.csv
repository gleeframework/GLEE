"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very generous, but heavily favors you. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a great deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
