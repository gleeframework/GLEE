"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid any potential inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the offer is not as favorable to me as my initial proposal, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer before things get even worse due to inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking its toll! I'm starting to feel the pinch.

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to accept it. The money is worth significantly less now, and I don't want to risk waiting for another offer that might be even worse.
