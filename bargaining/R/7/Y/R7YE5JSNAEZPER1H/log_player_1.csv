Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% of the money. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I don't think I'm being generous, but I appreciate the sentiment. However, I'm not willing to give away 80% of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me this time.""

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of me, but I'm not falling for it. I'll meet you at a fair price. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now! My gains are worth less and less.

Considering the offer, I think Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. I'll think about it...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a significant share of the remaining money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a decent share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm not going to take advantage of you. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I think Bob is being fair, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'm getting a smaller share than before, and the value of my gain is significantly reduced due to inflation.

However, I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal. I'll accept this offer.
