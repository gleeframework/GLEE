"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'll give you 40 and take 60 this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good deal for me!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer and accept it."
