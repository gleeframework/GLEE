"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept this offer. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and the difference between $4,500 and $5,500 is not worth the risk of waiting."
