Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very generous offer in the first round. I'm hoping that Bob will accept it, but if not, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk losing even more due to inflation."
