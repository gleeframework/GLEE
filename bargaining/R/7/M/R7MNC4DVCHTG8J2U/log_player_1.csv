"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 seems reasonable""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a fairly even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60, I'll give you 20, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $20 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $19. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $80 is worth 20% less than the original, but I'll assume it's 80% of its original value, which is $80.

Considering the offer, I think I'm being taken advantage of. I'm not accepting this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting 50, I'm still the one making the offer, and I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain of $15 is worth 85.74% of its original value, which is approximately $12.88.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $12.88. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.
