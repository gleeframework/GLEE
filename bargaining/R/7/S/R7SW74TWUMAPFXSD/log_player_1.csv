I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor, since I'm making the first offer.  I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob isn't happy with it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and with inflation kicking in, it's better to take what I can get now."
