Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, I'll get the bigger piece! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll decide to...
