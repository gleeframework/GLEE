Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Inflation is crippling your negotiating power. I'll take advantage of that.

This is a tough situation, but I have to cut my losses.  

Bob is clearly willing to drag this out to exploit the inflation. If I reject this offer, I'll be forced to settle for even less in the next round, as the value of the money continues to decline for me. It's a disappointing outcome, but taking the $2500 is the best I can hope for at this point."
