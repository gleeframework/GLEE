I'll start by offering a pretty generous deal to Bob.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I'm going to try to secure a large portion of the money for myself in the first round.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I initially aimed for a larger share, the inflation factor makes accepting Bob's offer more appealing. My potential gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, making 40 dollars a better outcome than risking further rounds and potentially getting an even smaller share."
