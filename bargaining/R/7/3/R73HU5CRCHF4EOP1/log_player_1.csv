"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and leaving Bob with 40 dollars. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a bit more than you offered me, let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
