"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose that I take $90 and Bob takes $10.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a good deal for me. Even though Bob is taking a larger share, the inflation means that my share is worth the same as in the previous round. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, while rejecting it risks getting nothing at all."
