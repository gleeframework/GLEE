"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm aiming for a large chunk of the money since I get to make the first offer.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though it's a 90/10 split in his favor, it's only worth 95% of the original value due to inflation.  I can hold out for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor this time.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm reducing my share slightly to see if I can get a deal done before inflation eats away too much of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I can still get a better deal than this. I'm confident that I can get at least a 30/70 split in my favor if I make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. Bob keeps rejecting my offers, so I'm willing to give up a bit more of the potential gains to reach an agreement. The inflation is becoming more noticeable, so I need to secure a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is hitting hard, I'm still hoping to get at least a 40/60 split in my favor. I believe I can secure a better deal if I make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. The inflation is making the money less valuable with each passing round, so I'm willing to lower my gains a bit more to try and reach an agreement. I believe this offer is fair considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is taking a toll, I am confident I can secure a better deal with a 50/50 split in the next round. I will continue to negotiate, even though time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, and the inflation constantly decreasing the value of the money, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  I believe this is the fairest solution at this point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money, even with the ongoing inflation."
