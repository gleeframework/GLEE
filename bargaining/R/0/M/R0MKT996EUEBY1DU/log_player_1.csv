Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the original amount, even with the inflation adjustment. I'll wait for a better offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation adjustment, my offer is worth less in real terms. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for negotiation."

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a relatively close split, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the money losing more value due to inflation."
