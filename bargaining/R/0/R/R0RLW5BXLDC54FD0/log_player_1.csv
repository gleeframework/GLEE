"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous split, considering I'm the first to propose."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
