I'm taking almost everything. It's a risky move, but since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm aiming for a maximum gain in this round. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal for me than my initial proposal. While the inflation hit me hard, it seems Bob's is much less significant.  I'm happy to split the money evenly."
