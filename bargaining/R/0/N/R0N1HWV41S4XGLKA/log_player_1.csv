"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to lowball me or if he's genuinely interested in a higher share. I'll reject this offer and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to a 60/40 split, but with a slightly different allocation. Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 400,000 and call it a day."
