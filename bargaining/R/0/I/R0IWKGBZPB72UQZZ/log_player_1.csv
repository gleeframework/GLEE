"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $8,000 is now equivalent to $6,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I think splitting it down the middle is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of $6,400 is now equivalent to $5,120. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable offer for Bob!"
