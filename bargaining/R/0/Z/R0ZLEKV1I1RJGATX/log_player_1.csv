"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's split it 4:1""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4:6 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping Bob will make an even more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 4:6, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better split.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""You can't have it all, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
