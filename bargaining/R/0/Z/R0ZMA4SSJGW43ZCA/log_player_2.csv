"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll offer a slightly skewed split in my favor.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I think Alice's offer is a bit more reasonable now. I'll accept it.
