"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, you can't do better than that!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's try to find a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, and I don't want to settle for 50-50 just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'll give you a bit more, but not too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob rejected the 50-50 offer, and I'm offering him a slightly better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll! With the money worth 27.1% less, my offer from round 3 is now equivalent to about 4,400. I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 60-40 split, especially since my offer from round 3 was already a better deal for him than this one. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting the better end of the deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a better deal for myself. The inflation is making the money worth less and less, so I need to adjust my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not falling for your tricks, let's try to find a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a hit! With the money worth 40.95% less than in the first round, my offer from round 5 is now equivalent to about 3,300. I'll reject Bob's offer from round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 55-45 split, especially since my offer from round 5 was already a better deal for him than this one. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'm getting a bit worried about the time running out!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Fine, we're down to the wire, let's just split it 50-50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm getting desperate, and the inflation is making the money worth so little that I'm willing to compromise and split it 50-50. It's not the best deal for me, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
