"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob wants to flip the original proposal. I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60-40 split, especially since I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving me $45 and Bob $55. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
