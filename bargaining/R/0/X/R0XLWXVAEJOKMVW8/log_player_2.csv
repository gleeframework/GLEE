Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a quarter of a million dollars. That's a lot of money even with the inflation! Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer is getting better, time is running out, it's still not a great deal for Bob. He needs to push for a more significant share while he still has some leverage."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit to get this done. 300,000 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but the clock is a huge factor now. While ideally, Bob would want a higher share, Alice is unlikely to budge further. Accepting now guarantees Bob gets something, whereas continuing the game carries a massive risk of ending up with nothing."
