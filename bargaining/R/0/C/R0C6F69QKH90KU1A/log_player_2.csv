Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make it seem like she's compromising, the deal is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. I need to hold firm and try to get a better offer. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split is the fairest way to ensure we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. Let's end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and we're past the halfway point.  Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share, but my position is weakening with each round due to inflation. Offering a 50/50 split is my strongest play now:

* **Fairness:** It's objectively the fairest deal.
* **Urgency:** The ""final offer"" language emphasizes the need for Alice to accept before we both lose.
* **Prevents further losses:** By settling now, I prevent further erosion of my potential gains by inflation.

It's a gamble, but waiting longer might force me to accept an even worse deal."
