Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 90/10. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation penalty you'll have to deal with in the future rounds. Let's be reasonable and end the game now.

# Alice gain: 900000

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're not going to get anywhere with these lopsided proposals. Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This will ensure we both get a decent share, even with the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
