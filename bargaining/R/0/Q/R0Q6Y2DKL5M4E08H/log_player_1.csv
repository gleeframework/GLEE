"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to take that into account.

In this case, I'll consider the effective gain for Bob to be 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16 (since 5% of 5000 is 250, and 5000 - 250 = 4750, and 4750 / 0.95 = 5000, but since we're considering the 5% decrease, we actually have 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16).

Since this is still a 50/50 split, and I'm getting 5000, which is worth the same as before, I'll accept this offer.
