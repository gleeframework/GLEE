"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can shake on it?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's fair 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly better deal this time.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more cautious with my decision.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal later on. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
