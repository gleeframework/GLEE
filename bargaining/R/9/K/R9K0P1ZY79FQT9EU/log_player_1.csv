"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money in a 3:2 ratio, with you receiving $4000. I believe this is fair considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 55/45, with me taking the larger share. This is fair as the value of money decreases faster for you, and this allows us both to gain a significant portion of the total. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
