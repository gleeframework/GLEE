Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take one more chance. This is a serious offer considering the circumstances.

# Alice gain: 590000

This is a tough situation, but it's better to accept something rather than risk getting nothing. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Returns:** The inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. Each round makes accepting a deal less appealing for him.
* **Alice Holds the Advantage:**  Alice is aware of the inflation and its effect on Bob's decision-making. She's likely to continue offering deals that are increasingly beneficial to her.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If Bob rejects this offer and the game continues, he risks Alice offering even less in subsequent rounds. He could end up with a drastically smaller share or even nothing if he runs out of rounds.

While not ideal, accepting the current offer secures Bob a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
