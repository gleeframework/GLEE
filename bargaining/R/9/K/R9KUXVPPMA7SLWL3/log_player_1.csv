"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  This seems fair, as I am taking the majority of the risk by offering first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still losing too much with this offer. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a 700,000 to 300,000 split in my favor.  This is a more balanced offer than the first round, and I'm hoping to get closer to the 50/50 split before the inflation erodes too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm still losing too much with this offer. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing an even 50/50 split.  While the inflation has hurt my earnings significantly, I believe this is the fairest way to divide the remaining money.  I'm hoping Bob will agree to this offer, as I don't think we'll be able to reach a more equitable split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but with the inflation hitting me so hard, accepting this offer is the best option.  While it's not the 50/50 split I was hoping for, it's better than the alternative of potentially getting nothing in the next round."
