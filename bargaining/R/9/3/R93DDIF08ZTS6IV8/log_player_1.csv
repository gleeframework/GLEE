"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was slightly more generous than mine in the previous round, I'll try to make a more competitive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000, and I'll take $480,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept it. The money is worth significantly less than before, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

After weighing my options, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like I'll be taking $400,000 and Bob will take $600,000."
