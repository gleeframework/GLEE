"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, let's negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 2:8 split. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up control! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially considering the money is still worth less for me due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and keeping the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to your target, but I'm not going to give up yet! This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still a very uneven split, and I'm not willing to accept a 15/85 split. I'm getting close to the 12-round limit, so I'm going to try to squeeze out a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to the 50/50 split, but I'm not negotiating further. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split again, but this time I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to budge further. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal."
