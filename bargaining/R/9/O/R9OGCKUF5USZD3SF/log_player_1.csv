"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'm keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, the $70 I would gain is actually worth $56 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not sure if it's a good deal, but I'll have to think carefully. Since I didn't get a better offer in the first round, I'll have to consider this one. 

I'll accept this offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
