70.0,30.0,Let's split the money 70/30. This way we both get a good deal right away and avoid the risk of losing everything due to inflation.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split.  Let's go with a 55/45 split, which gives you a good share while still ensuring we both get something.  It's a fair deal that allows us to avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's not quite fair considering the inflation rate is hitting you much harder.  I'm proposing 65/35. This gives us both a reasonable share while acknowledging the shrinking pot.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm still worried about the inflation impacting us both, but I think a 60/40 split is a good compromise. This ensures we both get a fair share while minimizing the risk of losing out entirely.  Let's move forward and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing with every passing round. I'm proposing 60/40. It's a strong offer for me, but it ensures you get something substantial before the inflation eats away at it even more.",Alice,5,
