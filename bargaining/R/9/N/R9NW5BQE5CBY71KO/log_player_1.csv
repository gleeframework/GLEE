Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me this round, I'm getting a smaller share than I would have liked. However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and try to negotiate further. I want to aim for a better share, especially since the money is decreasing in value with each round."

Bob's offer is laughable. 1 is an insultingly small share, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll try to get a slightly better share, even if it's still a compromise.
