"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, let's split it 60/40. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll counter your offer. Let's split it 60/40, but this time it's my way. We both need to keep up with inflation, so let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, but it's not yet at a point where I should accept a deal this unbalanced. I need to push for a larger share while it's still somewhat worthwhile."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - 55/45.  We're both losing money if this drags on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It seems like we're both stubborn, so let's just split it evenly. This way we both get something, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

An even split is the fairest outcome, and while we've both lost a significant chunk to inflation, getting $500,000 is much better than getting $0 if we fail to reach an agreement.  It's time to be pragmatic and secure a reasonable payout."
