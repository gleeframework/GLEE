"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $10,000 where I, Alice, receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. My message to Bob is, ""Let's share fairly."" This division slightly favors me, but it's close enough to an equal split that I hope Bob will consider it reasonable and accept, thus ending the game early and minimizing the impact of inflation on the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than further delay. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\nConsidering the offer from Bob, where I receive $4,000 and he receives $6,000, and taking into account the message that this offer leaves us both better off than further delay, I must weigh the pros and cons. The money I gain is now worth 20% less due to inflation, which means the effective value for me is $3,200. Meanwhile, Bob's share is worth 5% less, making his effective gain $5,700.\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money with each round and the current offer, I must decide whether holding out for a better deal in subsequent rounds is worth the risk of further devaluation of the money. Since the offer still provides a significant amount, and considering the risk of further loss due to inflation, I will accept Bob's offer to secure the $4,000 before the money loses even more value.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
