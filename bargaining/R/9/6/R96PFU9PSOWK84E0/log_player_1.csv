"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to get this game over quickly! Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more favorable for him, but I'm going to hold out for a better deal. The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm confident I can get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm sticking with a high offer for myself, but I'm also trying to be fair to Bob. I think this offer is reasonable considering the inflation, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting bolder with his offers, but I'm still not convinced. The inflation is really hitting his share hard, and I think I can push for even more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm sticking with a high offer for myself, but I'm also trying to be fair to Bob.  I think this offer is reasonable considering the inflation, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 72 
# Bob gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm getting nervous about the inflation, and Bob's share is getting seriously deflated.  I think this is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing everything!"
