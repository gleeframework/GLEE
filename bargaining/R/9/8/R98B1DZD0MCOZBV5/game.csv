6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Your split was unfair to me. I'm offering a more balanced deal considering the inflation. Take it or lose more in the next round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,The value decreases rapidly.  I'm offering you 4500.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting even less later.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  If you reject, I'm aiming for a much larger share in the following rounds.",Bob,4,
