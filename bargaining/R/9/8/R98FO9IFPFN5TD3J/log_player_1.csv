"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share to start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous with your initial offer, I want more now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer in this round will be worth even less than in the previous round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'll match your previous offer, but I'm not going to give you more""
}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split, but I'm trying to show Bob that I won't be giving him more than half of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not going to give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the 14.26% decrease, my gain of 4500 is worth even less than it was in the previous round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Bob seems to be trying to take advantage of my desperation, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive and make a lower offer to see if Bob will accept. Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll aim for a smaller share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you more, take it or leave it""
}
```

This offer is a significant concession on my part, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of patience, I'm taking control of the negotiations 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains. With the 22.62% decrease, my gain of 2500 is worth even less than it was in the previous round.

I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still don't want to give in too easily. Bob seems to be taking control of the negotiations, but I'll try to hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a very low offer, hoping that Bob will accept it to end the game quickly. With the inflation, my gain of 2000 is worth a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options, take this or we keep going""
}
```

This is a very low offer, but I'm hoping Bob will take it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm making my final move 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With the 30.17% decrease, my gain of 1000 is worth almost nothing compared to what it was in the first round.

I'm running out of options, and Bob's final move seems like a last-ditch effort to get the better deal. I'll have to consider accepting this offer, but it's a tough pill to swallow.
