"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you 400k, is it enough?""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet me in the middle, eh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet Bob in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I'm not going to go any lower!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive now, but still leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob will take it or try to make another offer!"
