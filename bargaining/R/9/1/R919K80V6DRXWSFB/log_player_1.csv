"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me, but leaves Bob with something. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If he rejects, he'll be making the next offer, but he'll also be facing the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take what I can get. Bob is clearly more interested in the money than I am, and the inflation is going to hurt me in the long run."
