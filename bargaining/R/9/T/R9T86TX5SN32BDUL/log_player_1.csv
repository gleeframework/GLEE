"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 450,000$ is now worth 0.95 * 450,000 = 427,500$. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the most I'm willing to give up.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the most I'm willing to give you. Let's settle on a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000$ is now worth 0.85 * 500,000 = 425,000$. I'm not sure if I should accept a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if I can do better. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the 50/50 split, as it's a fair compromise and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal."
