"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000.""
}
```

I'm starting with a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the value of money is likely to decrease with each round.  Let's see if you're willing to work with me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 55/45 split. I'd like to keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate affecting my gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for it. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. I'll take $4,800 and you can have $5,200.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
