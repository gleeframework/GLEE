"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99.9% and leave you with a measly 1000. It's a fair deal, right?

# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to take the lion's share, Bob.  But since inflation is hitting me hard, I'm lowering my offer a bit. Accept this and we're done.  Reject it, and we'll both lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 995000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to use intimidation tactics by mentioning the shrinking pot, but her offer is still extremely unfavorable.  It's better to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear you want this over with quickly. I'm offering you 400,000 - take it before inflation takes another chunk out of it.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Increased Offer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show flexibility and to make it more tempting for Alice, who is feeling the pressure of inflation. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept. She knows I'm serious and won't be endlessly negotiating.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  I'm again reminding her that waiting only hurts her share, hoping she'll make a rational decision."
