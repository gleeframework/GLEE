"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get a decent amount of money right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think about it... Since Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, but with a different split, I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is getting worse!

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be desperate enough to accept this offer, but I'm not sure if it's too greedy..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since it's a 50/50 split, I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the inflation and the fact that we're already in the 4th round, I'll accept Bob's offer.
