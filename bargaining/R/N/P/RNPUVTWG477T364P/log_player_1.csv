"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $10,000, which is $3,000. I'll take the remaining $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll reevaluate the offer.

The value of the money is now 90% of its original value, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400
* Bob gain: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600

I'll accept this offer.
