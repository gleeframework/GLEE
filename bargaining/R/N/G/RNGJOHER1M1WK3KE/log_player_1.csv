"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was a fair split, but I think I can do better. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's unfair. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money to Bob just yet. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, but I'm still willing to give Bob a significant share of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure what'meeting in the middle' means, but I think I can do better than this. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation again! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's not a significant improvement from his previous offer. I'm still not willing to give up a bigger share of the money to Bob. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 50-50, but I'm not getting any younger. Let's make a deal before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'm trying to make a deal before the value of the money continues to erode due to inflation."
