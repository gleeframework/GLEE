Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the inflation is greatly impacting Bob, this offer is still far too low for me. It's clear that the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult and we need to find a way to compromise before the remaining money is completely worthless."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is considerably better due to the significant inflation affecting him, it's still too low for me to accept. We're running out of time, and I need to hold out for a more equitable division to avoid losing a significant portion of the potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}

We're both losing a lot of value with each passing round. I'm offering a significant compromise in this final round, acknowledging the extreme impact of inflation on Bob.  Hopefully, he'll recognize the urgency of securing something before the remaining money is worthless."

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I understand the gravity of the situation and the significant disadvantage Bob is facing due to inflation, I cannot accept this offer. It's simply too low, and accepting it would mean losing most of the potential gains. Even though we're at the final round, I'm holding out for a fairer division, hoping for a last-minute compromise."
