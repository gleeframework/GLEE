"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. With the current proposal, I'd be getting $5,000, which is worth 60% of the original $8,000 I proposed in the first round. I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob and will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, I'm still in the driver's seat! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be even more cautious. With the current proposal, I'd be getting $4,000, which is worth about 40% of the original $8,000 I proposed in the first round. I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
