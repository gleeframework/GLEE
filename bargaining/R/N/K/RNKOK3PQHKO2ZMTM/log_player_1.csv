"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fair, considering I get to make the offer this round. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob is offering the same split as I did in round 1, but now I'm the one getting $400,000, I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less from the first round, and another 10% less from the second round), I'll aim to get a higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need more to account for the lost value!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I'm not sure what's happening with this inflation, but I don't want to keep going back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob now, but I'm still getting the same amount as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

However, I'm not thrilled about getting $500,000 when I could potentially get more. But, I also don't want to keep going back and forth. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
