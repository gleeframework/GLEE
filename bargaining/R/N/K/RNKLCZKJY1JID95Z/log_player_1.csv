Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll start by proposing a division of $9,000 for myself and $1,000 for Bob.  I think it's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the initial offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is fair and it seems we both would get an equal share, so I accept."
