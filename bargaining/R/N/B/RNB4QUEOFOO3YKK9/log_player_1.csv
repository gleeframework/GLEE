I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept. I figure he'll be more likely to agree to a smaller amount now than in later rounds when he knows about the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Even with the inflation, 5000 is better than the 7200 I would get from my 9000 share with a 20% reduction.  It's likely that if I reject, the next round will offer me even less, especially as Bob won't be affected by inflation on his side."
