# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this offer is better than her previous one, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better deal and emphasize the shrinking pot."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is slipping away with every passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""}"
