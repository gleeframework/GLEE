"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I want more too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for me due to inflation, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not too thrilled about the 30% gain for Bob, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to make up for the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keep a decent amount for myself considering the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of money, I'm not sure if 80 is enough for me. I'd like to think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, but I'd like to try!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth even less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need to prioritize my own gain now""
}
```

I'm being more aggressive in this offer, considering the rapidly decreasing value of money. I'm trying to get as much as I can while still keeping some for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering the extremely low value of the money now, I think I should take what I can get. 90 is a significant portion of the remaining value, and I don't want to risk waiting for another offer that might not come.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 90$."
