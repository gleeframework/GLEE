I'm Bob, and I want to try to get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to hurt and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. I'll take the 45."
