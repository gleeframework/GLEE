"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, it's important we settle this soon. Time is literally money for you! I'm proposing a slightly better split for me to reflect that.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but he's still trying to edge out a slight advantage.  The inflation is working heavily in my favor. I'm willing to take a slight hit to close the deal soon, but I'm aiming for a better outcome than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's wrap this up. I'm taking a small step back to show I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be settled now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the pressure increases on Bob.  The longer this goes, the more he loses.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering 5100 demonstrates a willingness to compromise but still secures a favorable outcome for Alice.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and emphasizes the need for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm being more than fair considering the circumstances. Accept this offer, or I'm digging in my heels. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, but his ""fairness"" is subjective and heavily skewed in his favor. He's trying to use intimidation (""digging in my heels""), but I'm holding firm.  The inflation is still rapidly eroding his position. I need to show strength and make him understand the situation."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5050,
""bob_gain"": 4950,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm holding firm.  You're losing more with every passing round.  Let's be sensible and end this now.  This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's crucial to show resolve. Bob needs to understand I won't be swayed by threats or attempts to frame unfavorable splits as ""fair.""
* **Finality:**  By calling this my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He needs to make a decision: accept a reasonable deal now or risk walking away with significantly less later. 
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm offering a very small concession to show I'm willing to meet him halfway, but the majority of the gains are still mine."
