Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively giving up 10% of my potential gain from the first round by accepting this offer. Considering this, I'll decide to:

  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000."
