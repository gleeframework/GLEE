Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split this evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
