"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates, I'll take a bit more to compensate for my lower loss""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered to take $6000 and leave $4000 for Bob, considering that I lose 5% each round while Bob loses 10%. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split, considering the inflation rates, but still giving you a slight edge to compensate for your lower loss rate. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. While it's a more even split than my initial proposal, I believe I can negotiate a better deal considering the inflation rates and the fact that I have more rounds to negotiate. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering we both lose value each round, I'm willing to compromise but still think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the lower inflation rate on my end. Let's find a middle ground!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a compromise that is closer to the middle but still reflects the difference in our inflation rates. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in settling sooner rather than later."
