"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose value with each round, so a fair split seems like the best way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is factually closer to ""even"" now, I'm not in imminent danger yet.  I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, knowing the pressure is on as each round passes."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I need a little extra to account for the inflation, but this seems reasonable.""
