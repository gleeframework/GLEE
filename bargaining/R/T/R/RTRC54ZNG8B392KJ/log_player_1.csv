  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""

# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now, or it gets worse! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are rising!

After considering Bob's proposal, I've decided to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 1/3 share, even if it's a tempting offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
