"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority but leave you with a small share.  Accept this and we'll both get something. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take something, it's better to see what Alice's next offer will be.  I have 12 rounds to negotiate, and inflation is going to hurt me if I accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly, it's the fairest solution and we'll both walk away with a good amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need the majority.  This is my final offer before the inflation gets out of control. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still very unbalanced, and even though the inflation is starting to bite, it's worth holding out for a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a bigger share than this.  Let's split it 40/60, which is a fair compromise considering inflation.""}
