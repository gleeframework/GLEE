"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is more reasonable given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation affects me more, but my offer is still the fairest. Let's end this here.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.  Even though my potential gains are decreasing, a 60/40 split is the most ""fair"" and starting with a strong offer might make Bob reconsider pushing further.  I'm keeping the offer the same to see if he'll accept a deal before the money devalues further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise.  We both need to benefit, even with the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of my potential gains. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a slightly unfavorable deal now than risk the money devaluing further and potentially receiving an even worse offer in the next round."
