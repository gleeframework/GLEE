Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a bit longer. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, and Alice is likely to become more willing to make a deal as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's end this now. A perfectly even split is the fairest and we both lose if this drags on.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to go for the straightforward approach.  Offering a 50/50 split:
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  This is difficult to argue against, especially as time runs out.
* **Highlights the risk of inflation:**  The message directly points out that further delays only hurt both players.

If Alice rejects this offer, she's signaling a strong desire to take almost all the money, which becomes increasingly risky for her as well."
