"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can work from here. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a generous offer, I think we can do better.  Let's see if I can get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the inflation we have to deal with.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. I'll take 65%, you get 35%.  This is more fair than your last offer considering the inflation, and it's a good starting point for the next round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a good deal considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
