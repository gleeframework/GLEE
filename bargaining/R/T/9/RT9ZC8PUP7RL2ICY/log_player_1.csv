Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Time is money, and we're already losing value! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
