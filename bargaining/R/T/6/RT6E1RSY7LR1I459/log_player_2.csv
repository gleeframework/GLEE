"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  Sounds good? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a bit unfair to start with such a lopsided offer. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly. I'll take 55% and you get 45%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 60/40 split seems more reasonable.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if I reject again, this is a reasonable offer."
