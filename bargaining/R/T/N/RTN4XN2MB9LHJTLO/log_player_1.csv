"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a generous offer, considering the money will be worth less for Bob due to the 20% discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm hoping for a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not going lower!""
}
```

I'm making a counteroffer, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, considering the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go all the way 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant reduction in value of the money, I'll have to be cautious. However, this offer is a bit more favorable than my previous one, so I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The reduced value of the money makes me more willing to accept a slightly lower amount."
