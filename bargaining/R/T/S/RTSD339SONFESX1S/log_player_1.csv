"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'll have to take a 20% hit on my share in the next round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split is fair, especially since Bob is trying to make a deal that benefits him more in the next round. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. This way, we both take a hit, but it's more balanced.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and agree to it."
