"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, let's start with this offer""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2000 and keeping $8000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm leaving room for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more this time 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my initial offer of $8000 is still worth $8000, but Bob's offer of $4000 is now worth $3600.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's less favorable to me than my initial offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Since Bob rejected my initial offer and then made a lower offer, I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, let's try again""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My initial offer of $8000 is still worth $8000.
Bob's offer of $5000 is worth $3639.09 (since it's worth 27.1% less than the initial $5000).

I'm not sure if I'm ready to meet in the middle yet, but it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
