"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer. I figure Bob might be more likely to accept it, especially since we both have a lot of rounds to go.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a pretty drastic shift in power. Bob is being very greedy, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm still going to try to get a decent share, but I'm going to reduce my initial ask a bit. This offer is still relatively fair, and hopefully, Bob will realize that we're both better off striking a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is completely ignoring the impact of inflation on me.  I'm not going to let him take advantage of the situation. I'm going to try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This time, I'm going to cut my ask down even further. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we're getting closer to the end of the game and the value of the money keeps decreasing, so it's better for both of us to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn and doesn't seem to understand the impact of inflation on me. I'm still determined to get a fair share, and I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll keep negotiating in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. With each round passing, my share of the money keeps getting smaller. I need to secure a decent amount of money before it's too late. Hopefully, Bob will recognize that the inflation is hurting me more than him, and he will accept this offer."
