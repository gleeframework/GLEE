**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that the offer is slightly better for me than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the inflation. With each round, the value of my share diminishes significantly. I need to push for a more equitable split, or the impact of inflation will make accepting a bad deal later even worse than risking no deal at all."
