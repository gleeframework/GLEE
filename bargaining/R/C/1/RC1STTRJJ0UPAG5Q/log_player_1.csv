"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, my $6,000 from the previous round is now worth $5,400.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $3,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
