I'm proposing to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000. I want to be fair, but I also want to get the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting a much better deal now, and I'm only getting 300,000, which is less than the 100,000 I offered him in the first round after inflation.  I'll try to get a better deal when it's my turn again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. Bob rejected my previous offer, so I think this is a fair compromise.  Hopefully, he'll accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, after inflation, my share has significantly decreased.  Accepting this offer means I'll get at least something, and it's better than risking further inflation and ending up with nothing."
