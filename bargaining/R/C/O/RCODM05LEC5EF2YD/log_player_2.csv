"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, considering the inflation. This offer benefits us both.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money decreases for Bob by 20% each round. It's crucial to get a larger share quickly.
* **Fairness Perception:** While Alice's offer might seem ""fair"" at face value, it becomes less so with each passing round for Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still reasonably attractive to Alice, preventing her from being too aggressive, while also securing a better outcome for Bob than the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation's Bite:** While Alice claims generosity, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of Bob's potential gain. 
* **Holding Strong:**  By rejecting, Bob signals he's not desperate and understands the impact of inflation. This might push Alice to offer a more substantial sum in the next round.
* **Time Pressure:** Time is running out for Bob to secure a favorable deal. However, accepting a significantly smaller portion now might not be the optimal strategy, even considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the time pressure and inflation.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  This is a critical round.  The value of the money has diminished significantly for Bob. Waiting any longer carries substantial risk.
* **Simplified Fairness:** By proposing an equal split, Bob appeals to a universally understood concept of fairness. This removes ambiguity and potential for further disagreement.
* **Finality:** The message clearly conveys Bob's desire to end the negotiation in this round, adding weight to the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept before inflation gets worse 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Dire Straits:** The inflation has severely eroded Bob's potential gain. Waiting any longer is almost guaranteed to result in an even worse outcome.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal. She's aware of the time pressure and inflation working against Bob.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While far from ideal, accepting this offer secures Bob something rather than risking a worse outcome in the final round."
