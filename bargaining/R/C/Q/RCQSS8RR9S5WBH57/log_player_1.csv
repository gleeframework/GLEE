"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a decent share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer being 50/50, I think it's a fair deal. The inflation hasn't affected the fairness of the split, so I'll accept this offer.
