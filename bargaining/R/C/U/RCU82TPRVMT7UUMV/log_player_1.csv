Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob just $1.  It's unlikely he'll accept, but it's a starting point. Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's a little unfair, but I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split. This is fair and might convince Bob to accept."
