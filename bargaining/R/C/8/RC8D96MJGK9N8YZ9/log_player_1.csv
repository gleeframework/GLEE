"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000 each, which is a fair and equal split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
