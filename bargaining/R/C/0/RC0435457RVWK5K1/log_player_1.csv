"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, knowing there's inflation to consider. This will give me a good starting point and hopefully incentivize Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially with inflation working against me.  It's time to show Bob that I'm not afraid to play hardball."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more reasonable, while still retaining a significant share. Bob's rejection last round showed he's not afraid to push back, but I believe this offer is fair enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and inflation is starting to hurt. I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm not going to give in to his pressure tactics."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

Inflation is getting serious now, and I need to make a compromise.  This is a fair 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game before things get worse."
