Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. However, given the inflation rates, I think 60/40 is a bit too generous to you. I'd like to propose a split of 60/40, but with the percentages reversed.  Let's see if we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
