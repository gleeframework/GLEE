"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal, especially considering the inflation we'll have to deal with in the next round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
