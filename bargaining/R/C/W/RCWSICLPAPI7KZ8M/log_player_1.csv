"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and hopefully, Bob will accept it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a tempting offer, it's crucial to remember the inflation. If I accept, I'll be getting $100,000, but it's worth only 90% of what it was in the first round. It's better to take a chance and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $850,000 for myself and $150,000 for Bob. This is still a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, Bob will realize it's better than taking the chance of getting nothing in the later rounds."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm getting a lot less due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. This offer isn't fair, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the pie.  I'm hopeful that Bob will eventually see reason and make a more equitable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a significant share. This time, I'm proposing $750,000 for me and $250,000 for Bob.  Let's see if this is enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm getting less due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. This offer isn't fair, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the pie. I'm hopeful that Bob will eventually see reason and make a more equitable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm taking another risk here and lowering my offer to $650,000 for me and $350,000 for Bob.  Inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I believe this is still a decent deal for Bob, especially considering the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I know inflation is hurting me, but I'm still not willing to accept such a low offer. I'm holding out for a better deal. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can secure a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going for a slightly more aggressive offer this time.  With inflation hitting so hard, I need to secure a decent portion of the money. This offer gives Bob a significant share, but it's also a good deal for me, considering the potential for getting nothing if we reach the final round."
