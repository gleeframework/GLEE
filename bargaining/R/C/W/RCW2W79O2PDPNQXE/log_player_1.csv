"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the offer in terms of the current worth.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 90% of the original $4,500 I would have gotten in the first round. That's a 10% loss due to inflation.

On the other hand, Bob is proposing to keep $6,000, which is worth 90% of the original $6,667 he would have gotten in the first round. That's a 10% gain due to inflation.

Considering the inflation effect, I think I'm getting a slightly better deal than Bob, but it's still a relatively small difference. I'll decide to...
