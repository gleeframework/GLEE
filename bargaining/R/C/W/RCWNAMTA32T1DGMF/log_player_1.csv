"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while still leaving me with a majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  The value of the money is decreasing with each round, and Bob's offer is a good compromise."
