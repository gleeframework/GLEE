"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you get $30. A fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation factor to ensure a fair deal considering the depreciation of money for both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's aim for a more balanced split to benefit both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the money is worth even less for you! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current inflation rates, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal that compensates for the significant depreciation of money on my end. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the increasing impact of inflation, where my gain is worth 36% less and Alice's gain is worth 9.75% less than initially, I'll propose a division that considers these depreciations to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges the significant inflation impact on my end and the lesser but still present impact on yours.""}"
