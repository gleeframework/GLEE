I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal and avoid the inflation penalty.  Let's see if he's willing to take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair. Even with the inflation, I'd be losing a massive amount of money. I need to make a counter-offer and try to secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my initial offer to $6,000, but still offering a significant portion to Bob.  This feels like a fairer split that might entice him to accept."
