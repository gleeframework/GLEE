"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Given the 20% inflation rate for me, it's crucial to negotiate a better deal to maximize my share's value.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering my inflation rate.""}\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the 20% inflation rate that affects me. By proposing a 60-40 split, I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice while also maximizing my share's value before the money loses more value in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, considering the 36% decrease in value for me due to inflation, accepting 3000 now would be less valuable than the initial 1000 offered in round 1. I need to continue negotiating to achieve a better outcome.\n\n###\n\nI'll proceed to the next round and make another offer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial agreement that accounts for the inflation affecting my share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on my share, I'm willing to adjust my proposal to find a compromise. This split should be more appealing to you while still addressing my concerns about the value decrease.""}\n\nIn this offer, I've slightly reduced my share from the previous proposal to make it more attractive to Alice, hoping she'll consider the impact of inflation on my end and accept this compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is impacting us both, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's find a split that works for both of us before the money becomes worthless! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Although the offer has increased, the value of the money for me has decreased by 59.04% due to inflation. I need to consider whether accepting 4000 now is better than risking further rounds and potentially getting nothing.\n\nHowever, considering the rapid decrease in value, I should continue to negotiate to try and get a better deal. The next round will be crucial in determining the outcome.\n\nI'll proceed with caution, keeping in mind that time is running out, and the money's value is decreasing rapidly for me.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to propose an equal split. This way, we both get something, and I minimize my losses due to the decreasing value.""}\n\nAt this point, considering the 59.04% decrease in value for my share, an equal split seems like the most reasonable proposal. I'm hoping Alice will understand the urgency of the situation and accept this offer, as further rounds will only lead to more significant losses for me."
