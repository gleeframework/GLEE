"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a bigger share, but still a fair split, huh? I'll consider it.

Since I gain 400,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, and the money is still worth 1,000,000, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm giving you a bigger share, now it's your turn to decide""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! Bob's offer is still a bigger share for him, but I'll consider it.

Since I gain 280,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, but considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth less than in the previous rounds, I'll decide to reject this offer.
