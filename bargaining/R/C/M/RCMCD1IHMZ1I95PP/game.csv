60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think 60/40 is not fair. How about we do 55/45? The money won't be worth as much if we keep going.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  We both lose value with each round, and this way we can both walk away with something.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
