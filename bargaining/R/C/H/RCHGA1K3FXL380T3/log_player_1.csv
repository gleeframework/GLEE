Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at my potential gains, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share. This is my final offer.""
