"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nIn this initial offer, I'm proposing that I, Alice, receive $60, and Bob receives $40. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money, starting with a slightly higher offer for myself accounts for the higher rate of inflation I'm subjected to, while still being mindful of fairness. The message ""Let's be fair!"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of equity, encouraging him to consider the offer positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair deal. This considers the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting $40 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a lower amount in the first round. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I'm motivated to try and get a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation. Bob's offer, although framed as a ""fair deal,"" doesn't adequately compensate for the disproportionate effect of inflation on my potential earnings. Therefore, I choose to reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nIn this third round, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential earnings, I adjust my offer to aim for a middle ground. By proposing that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45, I'm attempting to find a compromise that acknowledges the declining value of the money for both of us but still leans slightly in my favor to account for the higher rate of inflation affecting me. The message ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle!"" is designed to convey a sense of compromise and mutual consideration, encouraging Bob to accept this offer as a fair resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  The value is dropping quickly for both of us, let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for me, Alice, the offers have been decreasing in real value substantially with each round. At this point, the money is worth 48.8% less to me than it was initially, which means that even a lower nominal amount in an earlier round would have been more valuable than a higher nominal amount now. Considering Bob frames this as his ""final offer"" and the value is indeed ""dropping quickly for both of us,"" it's reasonable to conclude that further negotiation may not yield a better real-value outcome for me. Accepting $45 now, despite it being less than what I initially aimed for, may be the best decision under the circumstances, as it guarantees a certain amount rather than risking an even less valuable offer or no deal at all in subsequent rounds."
