"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of inflation. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more desperate!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
