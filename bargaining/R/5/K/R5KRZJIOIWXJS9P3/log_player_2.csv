"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for you in the first round, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. If you reject, the money will be worth even less to you in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation pressure, Bob, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's do 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I previously offered Alice a 55/45 split in my favor, and now she's offering the same split but in her favor. Given the inflation, Alice is under more pressure to reach an agreement than I am, so I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the increasing inflation impact on your side, I believe this offer is more reasonable. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to you, so let's settle on this split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're not going to agree on a split that favors either of us. Let's just be fair and split it 50/50. This way, we both benefit from ending the game now before inflation eats away at any potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that Alice is now offering a 50/50 split and considering the significant impact of inflation on her potential gains, this seems like a fair and reasonable offer. Continuing the game further might lead to more aggressive offers from Alice due to the increasing pressure from inflation, but there's also a risk she might decide to hold out, hoping I'll accept a worse deal. Accepting the 50/50 split now guarantees me $5,000 without the risk of further negotiations."
