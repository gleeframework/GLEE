"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100 and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, my proposed gains in Round 1 would be worth 90% of the original amount, which is 72 dollars for me and 28 dollars for Bob.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I get 50 dollars, which is 70 dollars in the original currency. I think this is a better deal for me than my original proposal, so I'll accept it.
