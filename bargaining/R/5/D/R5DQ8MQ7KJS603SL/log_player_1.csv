Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 400,000 is worth 95% of 700,000, and Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 80% of 750,000. I'll accept this offer.
