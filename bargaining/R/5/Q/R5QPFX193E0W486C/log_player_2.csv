Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is ticking and the value is dropping. This is a strong offer - let's secure our gains before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

{""bob_gain"": 620000, ""alice_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Alice, this offer ensures we both come out ahead, but accounts for the rapidly depreciating value.  Let's be wise and finalize this now.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching the halfway point. This offer is a compromise - it acknowledges the time pressure but still gives us both a good deal. Let's be done with this! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and is moving closer to a more even split. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm banking on her willingness to compromise further as the rounds progress and the value diminishes more significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 630000, ""alice_gain"": 370000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the value keeps shrinking.  This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.  Let's be practical and take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show some flexibility, but still aiming for a significant advantage while the value depreciates rapidly for Alice.  This round is crucial for applying pressure as we're past the halfway point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. The clock is ticking and we're both losing out. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal initially, the rapid depreciation for Alice has finally pushed her to a reasonable offer. Accepting now guarantees a decent share before inflation erodes the value further. It's a risk to push further, as Alice's desperation might lead to riskier proposals in later rounds."
