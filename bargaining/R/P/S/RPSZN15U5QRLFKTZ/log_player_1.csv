"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure if Bob is taking the inflation into account, and I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option. I'll wait for the next round to make my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight edge. Let's see if you can do better than this.""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I think it's time we came to an agreement.  Let's split it this way and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting a bit desperate...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that we're running out of rounds. I'll take the $45 and hope that it's enough to make it worthwhile."
