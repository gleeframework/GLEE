{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness of your offer, but I believe we can both do better. This proposal gives you a smaller share, but since we're facing inflation, it's a more worthwhile deal in the long run.""}

# Alice's message: Bob, this offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation, and it's more balanced than your previous one.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
