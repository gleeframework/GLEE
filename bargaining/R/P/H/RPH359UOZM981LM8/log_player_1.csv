"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate from here""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
