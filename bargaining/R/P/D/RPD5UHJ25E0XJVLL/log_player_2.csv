"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after each round, I'll aim to get a bigger share now to compensate for the decrease in value later. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, and Alice is now offering an equal split, I'll consider this a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
