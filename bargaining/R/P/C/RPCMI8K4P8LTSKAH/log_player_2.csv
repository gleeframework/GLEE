"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I want the lion's share. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""My turn, Alice. Let's be reasonable, I'm proposing a 70/30 split. Take it while it's still a good deal!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling generous. But we need to get this done before we both lose out even more! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the rapid inflation working against me. While 200,000 is a tempting offer, holding out for a better deal is still the best strategy.  Each round that Alice delays, the value of her desired share diminishes significantly faster than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and your share is shrinking fast. I'm offering 65/35.  Don't let this opportunity slip away!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her ""final offer"" bluff shouldn't work.  She's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working heavily against her. While accepting would guarantee some money, there's a good chance I can push for a much better deal in the next couple of rounds as her position weakens."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My offer stands: 60/40.  Another rejection and your share will be worth significantly less. Don't be greedy, let's end this!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting worried. I'm dropping my offer to 70/30. We need to end this soon before we both get nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide has turned. While not ideal, Alice is now offering a 70/30 split in my favor. The rapidly increasing inflation means that waiting any longer is getting too risky. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable amount, even if it's less than what I could have potentially won earlier."
