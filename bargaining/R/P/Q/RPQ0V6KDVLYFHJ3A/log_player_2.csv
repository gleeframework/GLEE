Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your point about the risk. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much.  Let's go with a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a fair deal that accounts for both the risk and my potential loss due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 5500
