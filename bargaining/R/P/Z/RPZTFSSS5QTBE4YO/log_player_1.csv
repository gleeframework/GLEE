"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 80%, now it's my turn to make a move. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I don't think 40% is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so it's worth 95% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 55% and you get 45%. It's a fair split, considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 55% to me and 45% to Bob, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still relatively fair considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll take 50% and you get 50%. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

However, Bob's offer of 50/50 seems reasonable, considering the reduced value of the money. It's a fair split, and I don't see any reason to reject it.
