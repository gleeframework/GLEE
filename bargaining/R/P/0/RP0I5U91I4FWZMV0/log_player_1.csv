"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more than you offered in the last round. Let's avoid any further inflation by accepting this offer. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even after accounting for inflation. I need to propose a counter-offer that benefits me while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. My previous offer was already generous. This is a compromise to get things moving before inflation hurts us both further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  My initial offer of 60/40 is now effectively worth 48/38 due to inflation. Bob's offer of 35/65 is significantly worse for me.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm reducing my demand slightly to 55/45. This still favors me but shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Urgency:**  Emphasizing the increasing impact of inflation adds pressure for Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
