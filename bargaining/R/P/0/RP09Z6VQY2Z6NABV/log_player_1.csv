"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less due to inflation (5% less in each round). Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to get a better deal.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
