"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation, my offer would be worth even less in Round 2. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give up 800,000$ in this round, especially with the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, and 40% less than in Round 2, I'll aim for a more balanced offer.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll! My offer would be worth significantly less in Round 4.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I'll take it. I'd rather have $400,000 now than risk waiting for a better offer and facing even more inflation.
