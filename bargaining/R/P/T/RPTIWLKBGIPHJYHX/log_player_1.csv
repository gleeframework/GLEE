"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount and can move on.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. It's a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 50/50 split is a good starting point, especially since the money is decreasing in value with each round. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the proposal. This way, we can both get a decent amount and still have room for negotiation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I believe a more balanced split is fairer in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I think I should get more than 40% of the remaining money, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise again, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since the money is decreasing in value so rapidly. This way, we can both get a decent amount and still have some room for negotiation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,200, and Bob gets the remaining 48%, which is $4,800."
