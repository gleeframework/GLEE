"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer to ensure a favorable starting position.
Given the rules, it's strategic to start with an offer that slightly favors me but remains reasonable to encourage Bob to accept early, minimizing the impact of inflation on his decision-making.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer amounts for both Alice and Bob.
Considering the strategic approach, let's propose a division where I, Alice, receive slightly more than half, but not so much that it discourages Bob from accepting. A 55-45 split seems like a reasonable starting point.

### Step 3: Formulate the message to Bob.
The message should be concise and encouraging, aiming to persuade Bob to accept the offer without feeling undervalued.

### Step 4: Construct the offer in the specified JSON format.
Based on the steps above, the offer and message to Bob would be structured as follows:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly and save the hassle.""
}
```

This approach sets a foundation for negotiation, considering both the strategic advantage and the impact of inflation on Bob's perception of the offer's value.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's be a bit more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer in the context of the game's current state.
Bob's offer suggests a division where he receives more than half, which is a counter to my initial proposal. Given the inflation mechanic, Bob's money is worth 5% less this round, but this does not directly affect my decision since my money's value remains unchanged.

### Step 2: Consider the strategic implications of accepting versus rejecting.
Accepting this offer means I receive $45, which is less than my initial proposal but still a significant amount. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a new proposal in the next round. However, since the value of the money does not decrease for me, the pressure to accept due to inflation is lessened, but there's an incentive to conclude the game favorably before the offers become less advantageous.

### Step 3: Weigh the pros and cons of each decision.
Accepting secures a known amount now, while rejecting opens the possibility for a better offer in the next round but also risks a worse outcome if Bob decides to offer less due to the decreasing value of the money for him.

### Step 4: Make a decision based on the analysis.
Considering the strategic position and the fact that Bob's offer is not significantly worse than my initial proposal, especially given the context of inflation affecting his share, it seems prudent to reject this offer and aim for a better division in the next round, leveraging the fact that the value of the money remains constant for me.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Reassess the situation and adjust the strategy.
Given that Bob's offer was rejected and considering the inflation's impact on his perception of the money's value, it's essential to propose an offer that takes into account his decreasing valuation while still aiming for a favorable outcome for myself.

### Step 2: Calculate the new offer amounts for both Alice and Bob.
Considering Bob's previous offer and the need to find a middle ground that might be acceptable, let's propose a division that slightly adjusts from the previous offers, aiming to find a compromise. A 52-48 split could be seen as a more equitable division, acknowledging Bob's decreasing valuation of the money.

### Step 3: Formulate a new message to Bob.
The message should acknowledge the previous rejection and express a willingness to find a mutually acceptable division, encouraging Bob to accept this revised offer.

### Step 4: Construct the new offer in the specified JSON format.
Based on the steps above, the new offer and message to Bob would be structured as follows:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, considering the decrease in value for you.""
}
```

This approach aims to find a balance between my desired outcome and Bob's decreasing valuation of the money, encouraging a resolution in this round.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
