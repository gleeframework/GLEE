"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a better split, considering I'll be making the proposal this time. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to try to get the better deal this time. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, and I rejected it, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly better split for myself.
