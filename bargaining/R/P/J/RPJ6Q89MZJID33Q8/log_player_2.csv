Alice's offer:

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, how about we meet in the middle? I'll take $55, you take $45.  It's a fair compromise considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
