"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money closer to 60/40, considering the inflation rates. This way we both get a good share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
