I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me taking 60% and Bob taking 40%. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm offering a 55/45 split this time.  Bob's offer was a bit too generous for him, and I'm confident that I can get a slightly better deal for myself.  We both lose money with each round, so it's in our best interest to come to an agreement."
