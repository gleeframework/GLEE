Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take a significantly larger share, even though the value of the money is rapidly decreasing.  While compromising is important, accepting an unfair deal just because of time pressure puts me at a disadvantage. I'll try to push for a more even split, but I need to be mindful that I might have to make concessions in later rounds as the deadline approaches."
