"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amount I'll gain in this round.

In this round, $300,000 is worth 95% of its original value, so I'll gain $285,000 (0.95 * 300,000).

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amount I'll gain in this round.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share.""
}
```

In this round, I'm offering Bob $550,000, which is 55% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is still a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amount I'll gain in this round.

The original $1,000,000 is worth 85.74% of its original value due to 14.26% inflation. So, $350,000 is worth $299,055 (0.8574 * 350,000).

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
