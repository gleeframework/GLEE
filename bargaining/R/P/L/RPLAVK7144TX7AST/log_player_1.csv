"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to the middle.  This way we both get a good amount, even with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of $450,000 is worth $427,500 (95% of $450,000).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, but it's a reasonable split. I'll accept his offer.
