"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not sure if I should take the smaller share now or try to negotiate further.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for me to make a new proposal. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
