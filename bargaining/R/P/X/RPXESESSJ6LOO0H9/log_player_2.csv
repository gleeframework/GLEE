Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split the money evenly this round.  It's getting risky to keep waiting, and I think we can both do better with a 50/50 split than if we keep pushing for more. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
