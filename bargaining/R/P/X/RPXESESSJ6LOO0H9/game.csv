60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about a 55/45 split now? This gives us both a better deal than if we wait.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split the money evenly this round.  It's getting risky to keep waiting, and I think we can both do better with a 50/50 split than if we keep pushing for more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
