"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is $6,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $4,000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. The 5% inflation means the money is worth a bit less now, but I still think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5750,
  ""bob_gain"": 4250,
  ""message"": ""Counteroffer, slightly in your favor""
}


I've taken into account the 5% inflation from the previous rounds, and I'm offering a compromise that's slightly more in Bob's favor than my initial offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still room for compromise 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again, as I believe there's still some wiggle room for negotiation. The inflation is starting to take a bigger bite, but I'm willing to take that risk to try and get a better deal. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5375,
  ""bob_gain"": 4625,
  ""message"": ""Midpoint of our last offers""
}


I've calculated the midpoint of our last offers and I'm proposing that as the new split. This way, we're both giving in a bit, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
