"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully.

Since my gain remains the same, but Bob's gain is reduced, I'll consider the value of the money I'll receive in the next round. If I accept this offer, I'll get 4000$ in the next round, but it will be worth 20% less than the 4000$ I would have gotten if I had accepted the initial offer.

In this case, I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 4000 for me, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to me, considering the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! With Bob's gain being worth 48.8% less than the initial amount, I'll have to think strategically.

Considering my gain remains the same, I'll have to weigh the value of the money I'll receive in the next round. If I accept this offer, I'll get 3000$ in the next round, but it will be worth 51.2% of the original 4000$ I would have gotten if I had accepted the initial offer.

In this case, I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 3000 for me, I'll try to get an even better deal this time. I'll offer a higher amount to me, considering the inflation is still affecting Bob's gain.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain now! With Bob's gain being worth 67.23% less than the initial amount, I'll have to think carefully.

Considering my gain remains the same, I'll have to weigh the value of the money I'll receive in the next round. If I accept this offer, I'll get 2000$ in the next round, but it will be worth 25.6% of the original 5000$ I would have gotten if I had accepted the initial offer.

In this case, I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 2000 for me, I'll try to get an even better deal this time. I'll offer a higher amount to me, considering the inflation is still affecting Bob's gain.

However, I'll also consider the fact that the game is getting close to the end, and I don't want to leave too much money on the table. I'll aim for a slightly higher gain, but not too high to make Bob accept.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```"
