This is a terrible offer. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

I propose we split the money 900,000 to me and 100,000 to Alice.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a much better offer than the previous round. I'm not sure how much Alice knows about the inflation, but I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
