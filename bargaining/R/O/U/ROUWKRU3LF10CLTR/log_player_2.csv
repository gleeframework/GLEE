Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's not drag this out. This offer is even more generous than my last. Take it before inflation shrinks the pie even further!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but time is running out! This is a strong offer considering the inflation we're facing. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, she is heavily impacted by inflation.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and her losses are only accelerating. This makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal in a later round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a deal where we both benefit despite the inflation. This is a fair compromise, and time is running out for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous! Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer is a compromise, and it's the last one I'm making above 50%. Let's be smart and take it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation.  This offer is slightly better than my last offer and it's unlikely she'll offer anything close to this amount again. Accepting now guarantees a decent share before inflation further diminishes her share and potentially leads to a worse offer (or even no deal) in the later rounds."
