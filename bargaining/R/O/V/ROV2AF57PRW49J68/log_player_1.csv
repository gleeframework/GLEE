I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to maximize my gains in the first round.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to keep 99 dollars, I'm not sure how inflation will affect Bob's offers in the future.  I also don't know how many rounds we have left. It's better to take the 80 dollars now and be safe."
