"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to play this strategically. Alice's offer is tempting, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your starting offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  This split reflects the time pressure, but also gives me a bit more incentive to accept early.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we both lose with every round. This offer is fair and gives us both a good share. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to get more, Alice's offer is fair considering the time pressure and the inflation. I'll accept it."
