This is getting ridiculous, but I can't accept such a low amount. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. I need to hold out hope for a better deal in the later rounds, even if it means accepting a less than ideal split."

This is brutal, but I can't accept a mere $2500. Alice is clearly taking advantage, but there's still a chance she'll become more reasonable as we approach the final rounds."

It pains me to do this, but I have to accept.  Alice is clearly willing to run the clock out, and anything is better than nothing at this point."
