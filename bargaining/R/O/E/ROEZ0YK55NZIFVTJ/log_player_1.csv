"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I am taking a more conservative approach in the first round.  I want to secure a large share of the money, but I am also aware of the inflation factor. Offering Bob a smaller share will hopefully encourage him to accept, avoiding further rounds where the money could depreciate more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the inflation has reduced the value of my gains, it's still beneficial to accept Bob's offer.  If I reject, I risk further inflation, potentially ending up with even less in the next round. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, especially considering the uncertainty surrounding the inflation's impact on Bob's side."
