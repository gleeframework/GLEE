"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $55 and Bob can have $45. This way, we both get a good amount, and I get a little extra for making the first offer. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, as it implies that I'm being generous by not taking more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a bit more, but this split seems more fair to me. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since I made the first offer and Bob rejected it, now it's my turn to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob seems willing to negotiate and make a counteroffer that favors me. Plus, with 10 rounds left, I have plenty of time to try and get a better deal. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""You didn't take my first offer, so I'm taking a bit more this time""}\n\nIn this round, I'll take $58 and Bob can have $42. Since Bob rejected my first offer and then made a counteroffer that gave him the larger share, I'm going to try to assert my position by taking an even larger share this time. The message is a bit firmer, implying that Bob should have taken the first offer when he had the chance. I'm trying to use a bit of psychological pressure to get Bob to accept this offer. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The deal is getting worse for both of us with this inflation. I'm offering a bit more than before, let's be sensible and wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer because, considering the inflation, the deal is indeed getting worse for both of us. Bob is offering me $48, which is more than his previous offer, and I think it's sensible to wrap this up before the money loses even more value. With the inflation rate increasing, I don't think I can get a significantly better deal in the next rounds, so I'll take this offer and end the game.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
