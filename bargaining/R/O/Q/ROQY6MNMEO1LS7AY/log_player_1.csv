"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a highly asymmetric split, giving myself $99 and Bob only $1. Since we don't know the inflation effect on Bob, this gives me the best chance of getting the most money possible, even if Bob does decide to play on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, it is highly unlikely that Bob will continue to offer such a favorable deal.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
