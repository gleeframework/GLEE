"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the bigger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it's not a good starting point for me. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  We can adjust from here if needed.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is compromising, accepting 45 dollars after inflation is a significant loss for Bob.  It's better to hold out and counter-propose, aiming for a slightly better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 58,
""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, I'm willing to move closer to the middle. How about 58/42? It's a slight adjustment from my previous offer, acknowledging your willingness to compromise.""
