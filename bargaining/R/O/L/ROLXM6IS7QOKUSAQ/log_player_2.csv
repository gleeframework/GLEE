"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I take a bit more to start, but you'll want to end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400001 
# Alice gain: 599999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'd rather see what Alice will offer in the next round, since the money is losing value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a fair split, Alice. Let's end this before the money gets devalued further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.  Another round and we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer.  While I might get a slightly better deal in another round, it's not worth the risk of losing more money due to inflation."
