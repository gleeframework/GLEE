"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the first one to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's try to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $2000 in this round is actually worth $1800 (10% less than $2000). Bob's gain of $8000 is worth $6400 (20% less than $8000).

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
