"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 300k and keep 700k for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but let's meet in the middle. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

In this round, I'll gain $500,000, which is 50% of the original $1,000,000, but 10% less due to inflation, so it's actually $450,000. Bob will gain $500,000, which is 50% of the original, but 20% less due to inflation, so it's actually $400,000.

Considering the reduced values, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
