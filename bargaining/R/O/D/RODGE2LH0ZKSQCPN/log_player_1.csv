"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round. I figure it's better to be aggressive early on and see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me. If not, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, even with the inflated values. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially since I have 10 rounds left to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to be more reasonable.  While I'm not willing to accept Bob's incredibly lopsided proposal, I'm hoping that this offer will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still securing a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still extremely unfavorable. Even though the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm making another compromise, lowering my share slightly. However, I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While the inflation has taken a toll on the value of the money, I'm still not willing to accept such a small portion.  We have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to be flexible, offering a larger share to Bob this round. However, I'm still aiming for a majority share of the money, and I believe that this offer is a fair compromise considering the diminishing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than previous rounds, it's still not acceptable.  We have 4 rounds left and I can continue to push for a more equitable split, especially as the value of money continues to decline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, and the value of money rapidly decreasing, I'm proposing an even split. This is a fair offer in the current circumstances and could avoid us both getting nothing."
