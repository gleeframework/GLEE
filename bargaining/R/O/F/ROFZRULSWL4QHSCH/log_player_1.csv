I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one initiating the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair compromise, as Bob's last offer was unfair, and we both know we could keep negotiating until the very end, getting nothing in the process. Let's end this now with a fair result."
