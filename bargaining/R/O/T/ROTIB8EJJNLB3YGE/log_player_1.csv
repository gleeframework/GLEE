"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think 60-40 is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45-55 is a better split for me.""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, this is my final offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split. However, I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially losing even more value.
