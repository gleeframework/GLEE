This is a terrible offer for Bob! It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal.  Let's see if we can get a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair deal. 90% for me, 10% for Alice.  It's a good starting point, and hopefully, she'll see the logic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Alice is still being very unfair. While the offer is better than her first one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Let's keep trying to get a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit to 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Alice.  This should be a reasonable offer, especially considering the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offers are getting progressively worse, and it's clear she's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I need to keep pushing for a fairer deal.  While the 200,000 is better than her last offer, it's still not a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm going to try an even split this time.  It's the fairest offer in my eyes, and with the inflation, it's a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm not going to cave to her demands.  It's not fair, and I still believe we can find a better solution.  I'll continue to hold out for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to try to offer a slightly lower split in my favor.  The inflation is hitting hard, and while I still believe in a fair deal, I need to secure a reasonable amount for myself."
