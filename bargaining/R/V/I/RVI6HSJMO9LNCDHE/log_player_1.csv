"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

This offer is designed to give me a large majority of the money but still leave Bob with a small amount.  Since this is the first round, I'm assuming Bob is more likely to accept a small amount than to risk getting nothing at all if he rejects my offer and the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, and while it's true that the value of the money has decreased for both of us, his offer is still much more beneficial to him than to me. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money.  I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer as it's significantly better than his offer in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial offer, and while the value of the money has decreased for both of us, his offer is still much more beneficial to him than to me. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to reflect the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that the longer we play, the less money both of us will get, and he'll be willing to accept an offer that's less advantageous to him than his last one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is now an even split, which is fair, I'm still not convinced that it's the best outcome. There's a chance that I can still get a better deal in the remaining rounds. We're getting close to the end of the game, and the value of the money continues to decrease, so I need to be careful about making a hasty decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm aware that the game is progressing rapidly and the value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. However, I believe I can still secure a better deal than the even split Bob offered in the previous round.  I'm hoping that the increasing pressure of the decreasing money value will push Bob towards accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer isn't ideal, it's significantly better than my previous offers and the value of the money continues to decrease rapidly. With only a few rounds left, I need to be realistic and secure what I can.  The risk of getting nothing is now too high to continue rejecting offers."
