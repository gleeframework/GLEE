"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fair split, but I'll take the lead this time. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll get 80% of the amount Bob offered me, which is 0.8 x 400,000 = 320,000.

I'll reject this offer since I was hoping to get more than 320,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway. 55-45 is a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 60-40 split I initially proposed. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's get this done. 55-45 is a good compromise, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll get 51.2% of the amount Bob offered me, which is 0.512 x 450,000 = 230,880.

I'll accept this offer since it's better than what I would get if I wait for the next round and the money loses more value.
