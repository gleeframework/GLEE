"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $45 and taking $55 for myself. Since Bob's money is worth 5% less each round, I believe this is a generous offer that he should accept to avoid losing more value in the next rounds. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair deal and that prolonging the game will only lead to him losing more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, considering inflation will affect my share in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his message, the offer doesn't seem fair to me. Bob is still getting more than me, and considering that inflation only affects his share, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since my share isn't affected by inflation, I have nothing to lose by prolonging the game, and I might be able to negotiate a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, taking into account the fact that his share is worth 10% less due to two rounds of inflation. However, I'll also make it clear that this is as far as I'm willing to go.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is my final offer. Don't lose more value!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $43 and taking $57 for myself. Given the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share, I believe this is a reasonable offer that he should accept to avoid losing even more value in future rounds. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is his best option and that prolonging the game will only lead to further losses due to inflation."
