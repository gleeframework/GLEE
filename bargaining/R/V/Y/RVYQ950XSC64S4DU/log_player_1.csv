"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and leaving Bob with $20. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a good start! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 20% less than the initial $80 I proposed in the first round, which is $32. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 5% less than the initial $20, which is $18.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'd like a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, my gain of $45 is now worth 54.4% less than the initial $80 I proposed in the first round, which is approximately $43.20. Bob's gain of $55 is worth 14.26% less than the initial $20, which is approximately $17.13.

I'm not sure if I'm getting closer to a deal, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can still do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money continuing to lose value, I'll aim for an even higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the final stretch! I'll give you 45, can you meet me here?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will accept it and we can finally divide the money."
