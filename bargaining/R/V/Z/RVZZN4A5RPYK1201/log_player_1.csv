"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll get the bigger share, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering you a more even split.  We can avoid inflation if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $45 is worth 5% less than the $60 I was aiming for in the first round. Bob's gain of $55 is worth 20% less than the $40 he was aiming for.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a better share. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
