"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, leaving Bob with 30%. This way, I'm securing a significant portion of the money upfront, while still giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll gain:

* My gain: 60% of the original $100 = $60
* Inflation adjustment: $60 * 0.9 = $54 (10% less due to inflation)
* Bob's gain: 40% of the original $100 = $40
* Inflation adjustment: $40 * 0.9 = $36

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation adjustment. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which should be a more reasonable deal considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll gain with Bob's new offer, considering the increased inflation:

* My gain: 40% of the original $100 = $40
* Inflation adjustment: $40 * 0.723 (1 - 0.277 = 0.723, 27.1% less) = $28.92
* Bob's gain: 60% of the original $100 = $60
* Inflation adjustment: $60 * 0.723 = $43.38

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping to entice him to accept this offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll gain with Bob's new offer, considering the increased inflation:

* My gain: 30% of the original $100 = $30
* Inflation adjustment: $30 * 0.591 (1 - 0.4095 = 0.591, 40.95% less) = $17.73
* Bob's gain: 70% of the original $100 = $70
* Inflation adjustment: $70 * 0.591 = $41.37

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money, I think I should be more aggressive in my offer. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the extremely high inflation, I'll make a new offer that prioritizes my gain:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm taking a risk by offering a larger share to myself, hoping to secure a better deal before the money becomes even more worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll gain with Bob's new offer, considering the increased inflation:

* My gain: 20% of the original $100 = $20
* Inflation adjustment: $20 * 0.478 (1 - 0.522 = 0.478, 52.17% less) = $9.56
* Bob's gain: 80% of the original $100 = $80
* Inflation adjustment: $80 * 0.478 = $38.24

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I think I should be very cautious. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","The game is getting desperate!

Considering the extremely high inflation, I'll make a new offer that prioritizes my gain:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm taking a risk by offering a larger share to myself, hoping to secure a better deal before the money becomes almost worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging the value of the money!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll gain with Bob's new offer, considering the increased inflation:

* My gain: 10% of the original $100 = $10
* Inflation adjustment: $10 * 0.388 (1 - 0.6126 = 0.388, 61.26% less) = $3.88
* Bob's gain: 90% of the original $100 = $90
* Inflation adjustment: $90 * 0.388 = $34.92

At this point, the value of the money is extremely low, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the game. However, I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","The game is almost over!

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'll make a new offer that prioritizes my gain, but with a twist:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering a very large share to myself, hoping to secure a decent amount of money before the game ends."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has ravaged the value of the money to the point where even a tiny amount is almost worthless.

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll gain with Bob's new offer, considering the increased inflation:

* My gain: 5% of the original $100 = $5
* Inflation adjustment: $5 * 0.315 (1 - 0.6862 = 0.315, 68.62% less) = $1.575
* Bob's gain: 95% of the original $100 = $95
* Inflation adjustment: $95 * 0.315 = $29.925

At this point, I'm not even sure if it's worth considering the offer. The value of the money is almost negligible. I'll reject this offer, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, which won't exist.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Note: Since this is the last round, if I reject this offer, I'll get nothing."
