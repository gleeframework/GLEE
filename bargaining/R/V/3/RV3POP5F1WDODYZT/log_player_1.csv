"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I've included a message that says ""Let's be fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a little more this time, but we can still come to a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a more favorable split. I'll make a new offer in the next round and try to convince Bob to accept it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share""}\n\nI'm making a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I've reduced my share slightly, but still want a bigger portion of the $10,000. I've included a message that indicates my willingness to compromise, while also emphasizing my desire for a larger share. This offer is still more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable deal."
