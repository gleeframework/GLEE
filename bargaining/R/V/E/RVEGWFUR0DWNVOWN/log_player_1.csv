"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get 60 dollars and Bob will get 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm thinking we should both get a little closer to 50/50.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll evaluate the offer based on the original 100 dollars. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is still a bit skewed in his favor.

However, I'll decide to reject this offer and try to get a better deal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more balanced than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting in the middle and accept this offer."
