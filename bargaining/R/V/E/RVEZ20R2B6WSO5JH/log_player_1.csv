"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm giving Bob a decent share to keep things fair. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards his side.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so I'll aim for a higher percentage.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This way, I'm giving him a bit more than in Bob's previous offer, but still keeping a larger share for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations again.

I think this offer is a bit better than my previous one, but I still don't want to give Bob a larger share. However, I'm not sure if I can do better.
