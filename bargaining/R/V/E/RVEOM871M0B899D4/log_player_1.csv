Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5800

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me (Alice). Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller payout, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split in a future round. 
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is unaffected by inflation and knows I'm feeling the pressure. He's likely to continue proposing offers that are increasingly in his favor.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me $4,200. Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the extremely unlikely event that Bob suddenly becomes generous in the final round is too risky.

This situation highlights the power of patience and the impact of external factors like inflation in negotiations."
