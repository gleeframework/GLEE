"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with 40%, or $400,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and balanced split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll take 7/10 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me!

I'm not thrilled about the 7/10 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
