  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk of the money to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"

# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think this is a fair starting point. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a 50-50 split, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate the offer:

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual value of the offer is:

Alice gain: 400000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.271) = 550000
Bob gain: 600000 / 0.727 = 824000

I'll reject the offer since it's not favorable to me.
