"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm sure we can find a better way to split the money. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though Alice is being generous, it's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided offer. There's a lot of time to negotiate, and the inflation will make the money worth less with each round.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal and we can both benefit from it.""}
