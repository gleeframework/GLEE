"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose taking 999,000$ for myself and giving Bob 1,000$.  This is a safe bet in the first round, as he has no leverage to reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $100,000, it's a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm confident I can negotiate better terms in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking $900,000 and giving Bob $100,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly more favorable to me.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to ensure I get a fair share before it becomes too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While $200,000 is more than I would have gotten in the last round, I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation is impacting Bob more heavily than me at this point, and I need to capitalize on that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing to take $800,000 and give Bob $200,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but with the increasing inflation, I need to be more flexible. However, I still believe I can get a better deal than what Bob offered in the last round."
