Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split the money relatively evenly, with a slight advantage for me to start. This ensures we both benefit from dividing the money sooner rather than later.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This is a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
