"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob! 80-20 seems reasonable, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! I'll give you a fair deal, but I want more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's still too skewed in his favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and take less, but I still think this is a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I need a bigger share to live comfortably in my retirement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not getting any younger either, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. However, I still think Bob's offer is too skewed in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The pressure is on!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, Bob. I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to take a bit more to get a better deal.""
}
```"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's desperation is starting to show! I'm not going to take the bait, though.

```
