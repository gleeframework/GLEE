"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the larger share but you get something too! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While getting something is better than nothing, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion, but I think it's only fair I get a larger share considering the inflation working against me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a better share than your last offer.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but I believe I can still secure a better deal. The inflation factor is becoming more significant with each round, increasing the pressure on Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value of this money is steadily decreasing for you. I'm proposing a compromise where we both get a reasonable share. Let's close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my position, but I'm making a concession to show I'm open to negotiation. Let's agree on a fair split before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough call, as Alice is clearly holding her ground. However, the inflation is working significantly in my favor.  Accepting 4000 dollars now when I could have had 4500 last round doesn't make sense. I need to hold firm and hope she becomes more reasonable as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  My offer is more than fair, and the value for you is only decreasing. Let's be sensible and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still aiming for a fairer split. Let's find a solution before the inflation completely erodes the value of my share. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting frustrating. While I want to reach a deal, accepting 3500 dollars now would be a significant loss compared to my previous offers.  Alice needs to understand that the longer this drags on, the worse it gets, primarily for her.  I need to stand my ground and hope she makes a more reasonable offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a perfectly even split to end this now. Take it before the inflation eats away even more of your potential gain.""}
