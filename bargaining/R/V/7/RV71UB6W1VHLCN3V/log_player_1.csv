"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away the farm just yet.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total. I'm keeping the rest for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both get half, and we can move on with our lives. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original value, so I'd be getting $720,000.

I'm not sure I'm ready to give up half of the money just yet, but Bob's offer is a reasonable one. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate, my gain is now worth 81% of the original value ($810,000), and Bob's gain is worth 18% of the original value ($180,000).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
