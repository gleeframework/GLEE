Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value fast. I'm willing to compromise, let's do $65 for me and $35 for you. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
