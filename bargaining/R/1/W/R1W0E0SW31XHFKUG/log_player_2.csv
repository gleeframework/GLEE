"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of. 60/40 is a fair split, given the dwindling value of our money. Let's end this before we lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation disparity benefits me.  Holding out for a better offer in Round 4 is the strategically sound choice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer considers the shrinking pot.  65/35 is my final offer. Take it or leave it -  we'll both lose if this drags on!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** This offer puts strong pressure on Alice to accept. Highlighting the ""final offer"" aspect and the mutual losses from further delay plays on her fear of getting a worse deal in the next round. 
* **Inflation Advantage:**  While I'm compromising slightly from my Round 2 offer, the inflation disparity is working heavily in my favor now. Alice is likely feeling the pressure to secure *something* before her share dwindles further.
* **Strong Position:** Rejecting Alice's 60/40 offer signals that I'm willing to play hardball.  This more aggressive offer reinforces that position."
