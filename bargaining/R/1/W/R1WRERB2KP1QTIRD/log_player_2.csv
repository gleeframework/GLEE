Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the impact of inflation is severe. While accepting this offer means accepting a less-than-ideal split, rejecting it means risking an even worse outcome in future rounds. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Every round that passes significantly erodes the value of Bob's potential winnings due to inflation.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly employing a waiting game, hoping inflation will force Bob to accept a worse deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss from rejecting this offer and hoping for a better one later is now greater than the potential gain.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting this offer cuts Bob's losses."
