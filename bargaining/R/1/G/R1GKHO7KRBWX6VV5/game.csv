600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's better to get something than risk losing it all due to inflation!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'd like to counter your offer. I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking 60% as I'll be losing money to inflation with each round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 58% and you can have 42%. This is a more generous offer than before, but I'm still not willing to give up the majority.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm still concerned about the impact of inflation.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting 55%. I think this is a fair compromise that considers both our interests.",Bob,4,

570000.0,430000.0,"I see you're still worried about inflation, but I think you're overestimating its impact. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your last one. Let's do 57% for me and 43% for you.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, so let's split it evenly 50/50.  I think it's the fairest option at this point, considering how much we've both lost.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"You're feeling the pressure, but I'm not. I'll give you a bit more than before, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. Let's do 56% for me and 44% for you. It's a good deal, considering the circumstances.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
520000.0,480000.0,We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it 48/52.  I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further losses.,Bob,8,

550000.0,450000.0,"You're getting desperate, and I'm still in a good position. I'll give you a tiny bit more, but that's it. Let's do 55% for me and 45% for you. It's the best offer you'll get from me.",Alice,9,
