"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 4:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the potential loss of value in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While it's not an even split, it acknowledges the potential loss in value for both of us in future rounds.  This offers a more balanced outcome for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
