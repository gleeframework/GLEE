```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value. I'll wait for a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game soon."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm trying to make a deal before things get worse due to inflation! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Given the reduced value of the money, I'll need to be more cautious with my decision. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 35%.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not convinced it's the best deal, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better proposal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the money's value, I'll need to be even more cautious. I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage, but not too high, considering the risks.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game before the money's value decreases further."
