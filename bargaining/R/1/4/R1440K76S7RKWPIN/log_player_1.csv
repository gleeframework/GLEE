"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can do better from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,500. Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,750.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split, with us both getting $4,500."
