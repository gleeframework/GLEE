"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, but with the adjusted values due to inflation. I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```"
