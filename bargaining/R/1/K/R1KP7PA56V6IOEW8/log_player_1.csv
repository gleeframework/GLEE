"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose a 990,000/10,000 split. This leaves most of the money for me, but gives Bob a small amount to consider.  I'm hoping he'll take it, as it's better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, 500,000 is still a significant amount, especially considering the inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
