"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though Bob is getting a much larger share, the inflation has significantly devalued Bob's gains while my own gains are only slightly lower. It's more advantageous to accept this offer and secure a guaranteed amount, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
