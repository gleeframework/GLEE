I'm starting with a proposal that favors me a bit, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is tempting, I know the inflation will only hurt me more in the next round. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share to myself than in the first round, hoping Bob sees that I'm willing to compromise and will accept before the inflation gets too bad."
