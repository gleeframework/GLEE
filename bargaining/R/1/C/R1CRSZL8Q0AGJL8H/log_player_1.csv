"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer this time. I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining $100.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50 this time!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise after Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
