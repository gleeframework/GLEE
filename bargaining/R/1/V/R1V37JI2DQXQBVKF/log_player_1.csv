"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm willing to give up some of my initial gains to try and reach an agreement. This should be more attractive to Bob than his previous offer, considering inflation has reduced the value of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is a worse deal than my previous offers, inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. It's better to accept this offer and get something than risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
