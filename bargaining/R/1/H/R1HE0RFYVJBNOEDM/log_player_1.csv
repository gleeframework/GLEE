"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair. It's close to equal, but gives me a slight advantage since I'm the one making the offer this round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Since Bob's offer is a 51/49 split, and considering the reduced value of the money, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd rather not give up that much.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my evaluation accordingly. Considering the reduced value of the money, a 55/45 split is actually a bit more reasonable than I initially thought.

Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 30.17% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my evaluation accordingly. Considering the reduced value of the money, a 35/65 split is a relatively good offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.
