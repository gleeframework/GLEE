Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Alice. How about we consider the time value of money? My offer accounts for the fact that delaying benefits me less than it benefits you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
