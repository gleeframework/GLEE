"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take 10% and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, Bob gets a smaller share, but still a significant amount, and I get the majority of the money. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a different division. How about we split it 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, but I still need to make the most of it!

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing, and I need to act quickly! Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a significant share. Take 20% and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
