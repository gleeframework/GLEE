"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me taking $6000 and Bob taking $4000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we both want to maximize our gains. The message ""Fair 60-40 split"" is a brief explanation of my proposal.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he rejects it, he'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Remember, with each passing round, the money is worth less due to inflation!\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we both have to deal with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 55-45 split, with me taking $4500 and Bob taking $5500. Although the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3! Remember, the money will be worth even less due to inflation.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my rejection and the details of the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a new proposal, with me taking $5800 and Bob taking $4200. My message ""Meet in the middle"" suggests that I'm trying to find a compromise between our previous offers. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my initial proposal to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer. Remember, the money is worth less with each passing round!\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
