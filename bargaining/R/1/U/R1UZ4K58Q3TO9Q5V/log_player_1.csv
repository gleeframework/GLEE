"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer to ensure a favorable starting position.
Given the rules of the game, it's crucial to start with an offer that is reasonable but also sets a favorable tone for potential future negotiations. Considering the impact of inflation, where the money's value decreases by 10% for Alice and 20% for Bob with each round, the initial offer should aim to maximize Alice's gain without being so extreme that Bob immediately rejects it.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer based on strategic reasoning.
A strategic initial offer might divide the money in a way that acknowledges the decreasing value over rounds but doesn't immediately offer an equal split, as the goal is to negotiate. Starting with a higher offer for Alice could provide room for concessions in later rounds if necessary.

### Step 3: Formulate the message to accompany the offer.
The message should be concise and provide a rationale or incentive for Bob to accept the offer. Given the game's structure, highlighting the benefit of accepting early to avoid further devaluation could be persuasive.

### Step 4: Finalize the offer and message in the required JSON format.
Considering the strategic approach outlined, let's propose an offer where Alice takes a larger share but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging the urgency due to inflation.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept now to avoid further loss from inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can both get more this way than if we keep declining offers. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on the current offer.
Given that the money is worth 10% less for Alice and 20% less for Bob in this round, the actual value of the offer should be adjusted accordingly. For Alice, the $5000 offered is effectively worth $4500 (90% of $5000), and for Bob, it's worth $4000 (80% of $5000).

### Step 2: Assess the strategic implications of accepting the offer.
Accepting this offer means Alice gets $4500 in value, which is less than her initial proposal but avoids further risk of devaluation. However, considering the game's structure and the fact that there are 11 rounds left, there might be room for further negotiation to increase Alice's share.

### Step 3: Consider the potential outcomes of rejecting the offer.
Rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round introduces uncertainty. Alice could potentially negotiate a better deal, but each round decreases the money's value, increasing the risk of ending up with less or even nothing if no agreement is reached within the 12 rounds.

### Step 4: Decide based on strategic reasoning.
Given the adjusted values and considering the early stage of the game, Alice might opt to reject the offer, aiming to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. The rationale is that the potential gain from further negotiation outweighs the immediate but lower-value offer.

The final answer is:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Adjust the strategy based on previous rounds.
Given that Bob offered an even split in the previous round and considering the ongoing devaluation, Alice should adjust her strategy to remain competitive but also account for the decreasing value of money. The goal is to find a balance that might appeal to Bob, given his previous offer.

### Step 2: Calculate the new offer considering the decreased value.
Since the money's value decreases by 10% for Alice and 20% for Bob with each round, any new offer should consider these adjustments. Aiming for a slightly more favorable split than the previous round's offer but still acknowledging Bob's desire for an even split could be strategic.

### Step 3: Formulate a persuasive message.
The message should emphasize the urgency of accepting the offer due to the ongoing devaluation and highlight any concessions Alice is making compared to her initial offer.

### Step 4: Finalize the offer and message.
Considering the strategic adjustments and the need for a persuasive approach, Alice's new offer should slightly favor her but demonstrate a willingness to compromise.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I've adjusted my offer closer to your request. Accepting now benefits both of us due to the increasing devaluation.""
}
```"
