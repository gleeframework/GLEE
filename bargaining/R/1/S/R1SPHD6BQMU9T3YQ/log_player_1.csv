Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see if Bob will accept a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have liked more, I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting Bob. It's better to accept and secure a large share rather than risk losing even more in the following rounds."
