"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept a 50/50 split, but with inflation in play, waiting could be beneficial. There's a chance Alice might offer me more to secure the deal before inflation hits harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor, reflecting the risk of waiting through inflation.  Let's make this a fair deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach this time, hoping to get a better deal. Your turn to decide! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is taking a toll.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and it's better than risking further losses in another round."
