This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation. While his offer isn't ideal, it's unlikely he'll go much higher with the decreasing value of his potential gain.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing with each round.
* **Decent Share:** 550,000 is still a significant amount, and securing it now outweighs the potential but risky gain of holding out for a slightly better offer."
