"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be careful with my decision. I'll have to consider the relative values of the amounts.

In this offer, Bob is keeping 60% of the remaining money, which is a bit more than I would have liked. However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now $9,000. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 58/42 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a relatively balanced split. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 3000, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up! The money is worth significantly less now.

Considering the new values, I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer. He's keeping 70% of the remaining money, which is a pretty significant share. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, but I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be careful with my offer.

Considering the current value of the money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 36/64 is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a relatively balanced split. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
