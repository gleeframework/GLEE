"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take 99 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar. This is a very strong starting offer, and I think Bob will be likely to accept it to avoid risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds. I'll accept."
