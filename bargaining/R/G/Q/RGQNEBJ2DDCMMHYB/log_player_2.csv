Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. After the inflation, a 50/50 split seems the most equitable.  It's a fair compromise, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
