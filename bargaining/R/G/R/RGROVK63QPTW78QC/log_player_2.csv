Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While this offer is slightly better than her last, accepting it would still mean letting her win by a significant margin.  I need to show some strength and push for a more favorable outcome, even with the shrinking pot."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit from inflation, and you're being stubborn.  52 is the best you'll get - take it before it shrinks even more!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share, give up already 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't great, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to refuse. Alice is clearly content to let the clock run down, and each round diminishes my potential gains significantly.  It's time to cut my losses and take the best offer currently on the table."
