"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money worth 10% less for me, I'm not sure if 40 is a good deal. On the other hand, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having to make another proposal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
