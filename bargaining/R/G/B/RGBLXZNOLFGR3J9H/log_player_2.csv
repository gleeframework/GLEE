"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'll take the bigger share since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think we can find something a bit more equitable. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Advantage:**  Time is on Bob's side.  Alice's share is devaluing much faster than his.  This means Bob has leverage to negotiate a better deal than a simple 50/50 split.
* **Strong but Fair:** A 55/45 split in Bob's favor is a strong counter-offer but doesn't completely disregard Alice's initial proposal. 
* **Future Rounds:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is still in a good position.  The value of her share will continue to decrease, giving him more negotiating power in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you want a bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much. How about we meet in the middle with a 58-42 split in my favor? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Leverage Shift:** While Alice's offer is closer to a middle ground, the inflation heavily favors Bob. Even though she's offering a smaller share, it's worth significantly less to her now than in the previous round.
* **Holding Strong:** Accepting a smaller share than Bob's previous offer would signal weakness. By rejecting, Bob reinforces his position and the importance of a more balanced deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the devaluing money.  Each round that passes makes her position weaker, increasing the chances of her accepting a less favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is slipping away with each round. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the changing circumstances while still offering you a reasonable share.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Justified:** Bob is increasing his demand to a 60/40 split. This is justified by the significant devaluation of Alice's potential gains. 
* **Time Pressure:** By now, Alice's potential share is worth considerably less. The longer the negotiation drags on, the worse it gets for her. 
* **Finality:** This offer signals Bob's seriousness and willingness to play hardball. He's indicating that he's prepared to go further if Alice doesn't accept a deal that reflects the changing situation."
