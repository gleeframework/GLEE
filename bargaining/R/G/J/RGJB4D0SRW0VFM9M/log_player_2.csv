Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice is still asking for a significantly larger share. The longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes. However, accepting a deal heavily skewed in her favor just because time is running out isn't ideal.  I'm hoping she'll propose a more reasonable split in the next round as the pressure increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer - a perfectly even split. We're running out of time and losing money with each round.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming critical, and the value of the money is plummeting.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical offer at this point. It avoids further negotiation and minimizes potential losses from inflation."
