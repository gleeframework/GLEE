Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's make a deal 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is inching closer, but it's still not a good deal for Bob considering the rapid inflation. He needs to hold strong and try to negotiate a better split while there's still time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer - a perfectly equal split.  Take it or leave it, Alice, because further negotiation is pointless.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time for a power play.  The 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical, and emphasizing that this is Bob's final offer might push Alice to accept.  The rapidly increasing inflation means Bob needs to secure a deal soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly playing tough, but her offer is worse than before! Bob's firm stance in the previous round seems to have made an impact. He needs to hold his ground, the inflation is working in his favor. Alice might be getting nervous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a compromise considering the time constraint.  Accept this and we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time for Bob to show some flexibility while still aiming for a better deal. By slightly lowering his demand but keeping it above Alice's last offer, he signals a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the shrinking pot. The message stresses the urgency and the practicality of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The pressure is on! While not ideal, this offer is better than what Alice offered two rounds ago.  Crucially, time is Bob's biggest enemy now, not Alice. Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, while rejecting it risks walking away with nothing if Alice continues her tough negotiation tactics."
