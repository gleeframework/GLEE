"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, I'll get the majority and you get a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of going to the next round and facing even lower offers due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering we both have an equal say in the outcome. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 45% of the money, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
