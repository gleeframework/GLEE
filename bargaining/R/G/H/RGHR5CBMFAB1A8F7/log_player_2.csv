"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a very unfair offer. While 1000$ is something, it's worth fighting for a better deal, especially since the money is losing value with each round. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair and equal split. I'm sure Alice will see that this is the most rational way to go."
