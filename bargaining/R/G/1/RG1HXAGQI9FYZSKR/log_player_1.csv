"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and leave $1000 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, and I believe Bob will be happy with this offer, especially considering inflation might make his share worth less in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation means Bob's share is worth less than in the previous round, and if I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing in later rounds.  It's better to take what I can get now before the value of the money drops even further."
