"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (900,000$), but also leaves a decent amount for Bob (100,000$). I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to accept in the first round, avoiding the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this isn't the ideal split, accepting this offer is the best strategy given the current circumstances. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Even though my potential earnings are reduced by 20%, Bob's offer still represents a significant amount of money. 
* **No Guarantees:** There's no guarantee that if I reject this offer, Bob will make a better offer in the next round. Inflation might continue to devalue the money further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of rejecting and potentially getting a worse offer in the future outweighs the potential reward of holding out for a better deal. 

It's important to consider the potential negative consequences of prolonging the game. Accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice in this situation."
