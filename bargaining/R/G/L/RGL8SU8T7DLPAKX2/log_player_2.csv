{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1}
``` 

Bob is sticking to his proposal, hoping Alice will eventually accept it.  While the value of Bob's share is shrinking, he's hoping that Alice will realize that this is the best she'll likely get, as continuing to reject will further decrease Bob's share, making it less desirable to him."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1}
```

Bob is continuing his strategy. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but Bob is hoping that Alice will realize she is unlikely to get a better deal than 1 dollar, and will accept his offer.  If she continues to reject, Bob's share will continue to decrease, and the outcome will be worse for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob continues to reject Alice's offer, believing that it's still better for him to hold out for a more equitable share, even though the inflation is severely impacting his potential gains. He's hoping that Alice will eventually realize that she's not going to get any more and accept his offer, but it's a risky strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1}
```

Bob is sticking to his strategy. Even though inflation is making his share worth less with each round, he believes that Alice will eventually accept his offer to avoid getting nothing.  He's gambling that Alice will be more motivated to get something than to continue the cycle of rejections."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob continues to reject Alice's offer.  He's gambling that his unwavering stance and Alice's desire to get something, even a small amount, will lead her to accept his next offer.  He's aware that inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains, but he believes this strategy is still the best chance of securing a larger share.  However, time is running out, and if Alice continues to reject, Bob's potential gain will shrink to almost nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1}
```

Bob is sticking to his strategy, hoping Alice will finally cave. Even though his potential gains are severely diminished by inflation, he's still betting that Alice will realize she's better off taking what little she can get than continuing the cycle of rejections. This round represents a crucial point, as Bob's potential gain is rapidly shrinking. If Alice rejects again, Bob's share will become practically insignificant in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 12.

Round 13
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 93.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob continues to reject Alice's offer.  He's holding firm to his strategy, even though the inflation is drastically reducing his potential gains.  He's still hoping that Alice will realize that her best option is to accept his offer, even with a tiny share.  This is a risky gamble, as the potential for Bob to gain anything significant is fading fast with each round.  However, Bob is betting that Alice's desire to gain something will outweigh her desire to continue the cycle of rejections."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 13.
Round 14
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1}
```

Bob is still holding onto his strategy.  He's aware that the inflation is rapidly reducing his potential gains, but he's still hoping that Alice will realize that she's better off accepting his offer.  He's betting on Alice's desire to gain something over her desire to continue the cycle of rejections.  This round is crucial, as Bob's potential gain is almost completely gone with the next round of inflation. If Alice rejects again, Bob's potential gain will be almost entirely negated."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 14.

Round 15
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 95.6% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob has to accept.  Inflation has made his potential gain almost negligible. He's effectively getting almost nothing, but at least he's getting *something*.  He's learned a hard lesson about the power of inflation and the risk of clinging to a strategy when the situation drastically changes. It's better to take a small gain than risk getting nothing at all."
