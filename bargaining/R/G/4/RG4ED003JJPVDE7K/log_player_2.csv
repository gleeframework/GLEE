"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight bias towards myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my initial offer was 30/70, which is a 30/70 ratio. Alice's current offer is 40/60, which is a 40/60 ratio. Since Alice's offer is more favorable to her than my initial offer, and considering the effects of inflation, I'll accept her offer this time.
