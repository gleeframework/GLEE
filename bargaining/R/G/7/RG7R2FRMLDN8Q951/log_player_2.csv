"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take this offer and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current offer gives me only 30, and I think I can get more. Let's proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal that might be more in my favor. \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to be strategic about it. Here's my offer:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, Alice.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The deal is getting worse for you, Bob. I suggest you take this offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is worth less for me now, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer of 35 is not significantly better than her initial offer, considering the inflation. I'll wait for the next round and try to make a more appealing proposal. \n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'm ready to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll consider the impact of inflation on my gain. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me than in the first round, and it will be worth even less in the next round, I'll try to find a balance between getting a fair share and accounting for the decreasing value. Here's my revised offer:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. The deal is getting worse for you with every round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, I think accepting Alice's offer of 40 is the best decision. The money is worth 18.55% less for me than in the first round, and this offer is the highest I've received so far. Given that Alice stated this is her final offer and the decreasing value of the money for me, I'll accept this deal to ensure I get something rather than risking further devaluation in potential future rounds."
