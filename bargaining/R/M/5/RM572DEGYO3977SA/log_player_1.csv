"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too hard!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it's a fair split, but I think I'm worth more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks he's worth more!

Given the new proposal, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'd gain in this round:

* My gain: 400,000
* Inflation adjustment: 20% less, so I'd actually get 320,000
* Bob's gain: 600,000 (no inflation adjustment for him, as per the rules)

Considering the inflation adjustment, I'd be getting 320,000, which is less than the 500,000 I initially proposed. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now that the money is worth less!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split, taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you deserve more, but I'm not convinced. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain in this round:

* My gain: 300,000
* Inflation adjustment: 48.8% less than the initial 500,000, so I'd actually get 260,400
* Bob's gain: 700,000 (no inflation adjustment for him)

Considering the inflation adjustment, I'd be getting 260,400, which is less than the 320,000 I would have gotten in the previous round. This offer seems even less favorable than the previous one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement at this rate. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to think about my own interests.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous offer, hoping that Bob will accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll make a serious offer. This is my last chance to make a good deal, don't blow it! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain in this round:

* My gain: 250,000
* Inflation adjustment: 67.23% less than the initial 500,000, so I'd actually get 158,400
* Bob's gain: 750,000 (no inflation adjustment for him)

Considering the inflation adjustment, I'd be getting 158,400, which is a significant decrease from the previous rounds. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, but I'm also not sure if I'll get a better deal later.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up yet. I'll make one last offer, and if you don't take it, I'm walking away.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. This is my final offer."
