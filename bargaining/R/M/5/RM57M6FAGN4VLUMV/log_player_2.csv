Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  I'm willing to take a slight loss, but I won't go any lower. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'm getting a significantly lower share due to inflation, I've already lost a lot, and it's better to accept a smaller gain than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
