"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, a fair share. Let's settle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'll be taking the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 70, but I want a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so I need to be more cautious with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not getting a good deal, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, a fair share considering the inflation. Let's settle.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a slightly larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 75, but I'm getting worried about the inflation, I want to get a better deal before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not getting a good deal, and I think I can do better.

However, I'm starting to get a bit worried about the inflation, and I might need to be more aggressive in my next offer to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 20, but I need to prioritize my own gain with the inflation. It's now or never.""
}
```

I'm taking a larger share of the money, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before the value of the money drops even further."
