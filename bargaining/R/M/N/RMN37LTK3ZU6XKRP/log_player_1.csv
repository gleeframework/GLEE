Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair split, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share to account for the risk of future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000
