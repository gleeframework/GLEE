I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything! ðŸ˜‰ Let's see if Bob is willing to accept such a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll take the $100,000.  It's better than nothing, and the inflation is going to eat away at the value of the money if we keep playing!"
