Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division that gives me $6000 and Bob $4000, with a message suggesting this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob is offering an even split, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it to ensure we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within the 12 rounds.
