"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer favors Alice significantly. While an even split seems ""fair"" on the surface, the inflation heavily disadvantages Alice as the game goes on. I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more open to a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""The inflation hurts you more than me, Alice. Let's be realistic. This offer ensures you get something substantial.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation. This offer is still reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is slowly moving in the right direction, but this offer is still unacceptable. The inflation difference is significant enough that I should be getting a larger share, even with several rounds left. I need to hold firm and see if I can push for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. Time is running out, and the value decreases each round. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're at an impasse. Let's be rational and split this evenly.  This is the fairest option considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's frustrating that Alice waited this long to propose a 50/50 split. However, with the time pressure and her increasing losses from inflation, this is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting now is better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
