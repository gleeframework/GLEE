Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, Bob, but I won't let you take advantage of the inflation. Let's split it closer to 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one! Here's why I decided to accept:

* **Inflation Impact:** While my buying power stays the same, Alice's is going down.  Delaying further is in my favor, but there's a risk she'll offer me even less later.
* **Alice's Position:** Her offer is closer to even than my previous one.  She's clearly feeling the inflation pressure and might be more desperate in the next round. However, there's a chance she'll dig in her heels and offer even less.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  55 is a decent chunk of the money.  Rejecting carries the risk of getting a worse offer later, while accepting guarantees a reasonable win now.

It's a gamble either way!
