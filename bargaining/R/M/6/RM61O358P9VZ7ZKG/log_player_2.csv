"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly tilted, division.  I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 100,000$ gain is tempting, there are 12 rounds.  I need to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering we both have a lot of rounds to negotiate. What do you think?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move closer to your 60/40 proposal, but I'd like to see a slightly more even split.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 350,000$ gain is tempting, there are still 9 rounds left. I think I can still get a better deal. I need to see if I can drive the split further towards my initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my initial 60/40 proposal, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a sense that we're both unwilling to budge too far.  Let's compromise and see if we can find a middle ground with a 55/45 split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer my initial 60/40 split, the inflation is becoming a serious factor. A 55/45 split gives me a decent share, and it's a good compromise. I'm accepting this offer to avoid risking the chance of getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
