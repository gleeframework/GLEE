I'm starting with a fair 50/50 split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's not a fair split, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob than the last round, but still giving myself a fair share.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Bob's getting greedy, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'll make a counteroffer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering Bob a slight increase from his previous offer. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation.  Let's see if he'll accept."
