"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you 10% and take the rest. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob will get $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent split, but I'm not going for 10% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $900,000 from the first round is now worth $810,000 (10% less). And Bob's offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for him.

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
