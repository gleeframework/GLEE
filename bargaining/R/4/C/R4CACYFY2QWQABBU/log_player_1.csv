"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that we can split the money fairly without too much haggling."
