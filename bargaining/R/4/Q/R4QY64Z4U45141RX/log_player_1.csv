I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair split considering the inflation, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
