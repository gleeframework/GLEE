```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I'm not willing to give up much more. This is my last stand. 
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With it being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'm starting to get desperate.

However, considering the offer, I think I have to accept. 95 is a huge chunk of the remaining value, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. I'll take it.
