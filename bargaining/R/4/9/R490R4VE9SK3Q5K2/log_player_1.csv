Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. This back and forth helps no one. We both lose if this fails. I propose a simple, fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

``` 

Bob is right, the back and forth is only hurting us both as the money shrinks. A 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both walk away with something."
