"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  Let's start with 60/40 in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I like Bob's proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60/40 is too skewed in your favor. I'm looking for a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that heavily favors Bob, so I'm rejecting his offer and hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 95% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between 50/50 and 60/40. Let's try 55/45.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to Bob's initial offer."
