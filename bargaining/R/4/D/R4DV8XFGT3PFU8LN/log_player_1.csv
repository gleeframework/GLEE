**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to frame the situation as dire due to inflation, it's important to remember that he's experiencing a much faster rate of devaluation than Alice.  

* **Bob is getting desperate:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, indicating his bargaining position is weakening.
* **Alice can hold out:**  Even though Alice is also experiencing inflation, her rate is much lower. She can afford to be a bit more patient.
* **Aiming for a better deal:** Alice's goal should be to secure at least a 60/40 split in her favor, given the advantageous inflation situation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. The inflation is affecting us both, but it's hitting you much harder. Take this deal while you still can."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is her final offer, Alice creates a sense of urgency.
* **Highlighting the disparity:**  Reminding Bob about the difference in inflation rates reinforces Alice's stronger position.
* **Appearing reasonable (but firm):**  Alice is sticking to her initial 60/40 split, which, while advantageous to her, could be perceived by Bob as a fair compromise given the circumstances.

This offer puts pressure on Bob. He can accept a less favorable deal now or risk further devaluation in later rounds."
