"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a small piece. It's better than nothing, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This round is my best offer. It's a deal that accounts for the time pressure and gives us both a good chunk of the money.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're being greedy. I'm willing to offer you a better deal, but I need to get most of the money, given the time constraints. If you reject this, we'll both lose a lot. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and the fact that the value of the money decreases for me, not her. While $100,000 is a significant sum, accepting this offer would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers in subsequent rounds.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. I'm dropping my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but 60/40 is the lowest I'll go.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the money loses value for me.  A deal needs to be struck soon.
* **Show Flexibility, But with a Limit:**  Lowering my ask from 70/30 to 60/40 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, but the 60/40 line is firm. This puts the pressure on Alice.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  A 60/40 split is still a favorable outcome for Alice compared to letting the game drag on and risking a worse outcome for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting tired of this back and forth. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but my offer is final. Accept this, or we'll both get nothing in the end. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use intimidation tactics now, claiming this offer is her ""final"" one. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting $200,000 at this stage would be a significant loss compared to my previous offers.  I need to call her bluff and demonstrate I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear you're aiming to maximize your gain, but dragging this out hurts us both. I'm lowering my offer to 55/45. This is a fair compromise, and my final offer. Let's be realistic and end this."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I need to make it clear this is my last offer to signal I'm serious about not being lowballed.
* **Slight Compromise:** Dropping to 55/45 shows some flexibility while still aiming for a reasonably balanced outcome.
* **Time Factor:**  The clock is ticking, and every round makes the potential winnings less appealing for me. A deal now is better than risking a worse outcome later. 
* **Appeal to Reason:**  Alice needs to understand that pushing me further is risky, and accepting a 55/45 split is still a very good deal for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm making a final offer. Take it or leave it. You're getting more than nothing, which is what you'll end up with if we keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, repeating the ""final offer"" tactic. She clearly feels the pressure but is misjudging my resolve.  While $300,000 is a tempting sum, accepting it now would mean I've caved to her pressure and accepted a deal significantly worse than my previous offer. I need to hold my ground for one more round and see if she's willing to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're down to the wire.  My final offer is a 50/50 split. Let's end this stalemate and both walk away with a fair share before it's too late."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimate Compromise:** Going to a 50/50 split is my biggest concession. It signals to Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal but not willing to be taken advantage of.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We are running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.  A deal now is the most logical choice for both of us.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  A 50/50 split is the epitome of fairness. It's difficult for Alice to argue against this and still appear reasonable.  
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** This is my absolute bottom line. Alice needs to understand that if this offer is rejected, I'm prepared to walk away with nothing."
