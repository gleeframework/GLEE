"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a chance to accept or decline.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 40/60 is a more reasonable split, considering the starting point was unfair 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less, so I'll consider the new amounts.

Since Bob is offering a 60/40 split, that's a 10% increase in my share compared to his initial offer. I'll consider it a reasonable compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
