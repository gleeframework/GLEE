"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was for a 60-40 split, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
