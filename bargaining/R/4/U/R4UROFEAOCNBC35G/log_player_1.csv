"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to 55/45, with me getting a slightly larger share. We'll have more time to negotiate if you reject. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is in my favor, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for an even better deal. Let's keep going!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor in mind, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to match Bob's suggested 55/45 split, but with a slight tweak to give myself a slightly larger share."
