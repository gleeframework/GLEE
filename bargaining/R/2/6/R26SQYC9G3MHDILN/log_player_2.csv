"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can negotiate later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is tempting, Alice's offer leaves me with almost nothing.  I'm confident I can negotiate a much better outcome in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be more realistic, Alice. This offer recognizes your time preference while still being fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split it evenly this time. Let's avoid wasting any more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a much better deal than Alice's initial offer and a fair outcome overall. Accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable share, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
