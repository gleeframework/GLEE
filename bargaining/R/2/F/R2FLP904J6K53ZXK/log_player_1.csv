"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a fair share, and I'll take 60 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 50 * 0.9 = 45 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair meeting-in-the-middle proposal.
