Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You went down, I'll go up, but still fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage.  While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the increasing inflation. I believe I can get a better deal by holding out a little longer."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the last offer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is still trying to push for a significant advantage, even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  She's moving closer to a more even split, but the rate of inflation means we're both losing significant money by not settling this quickly. I'll hold out for a better deal, but time is becoming a factor."
