"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's see if Alice agrees 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair split, indeed!

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like we've reached a fair and equal split of the money, and I'm happy to end the game here!"
