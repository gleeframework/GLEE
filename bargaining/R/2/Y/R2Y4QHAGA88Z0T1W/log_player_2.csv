Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time and both get a fair deal. I propose a 50/50 split.  It's simple, it's fair, and it means we don't lose any more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
