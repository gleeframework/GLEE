"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm aiming for a near-optimal outcome by giving Bob a very small amount, knowing that with each round, the value of the money to him is unchanged, while the value to me diminishes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, it's unlikely Bob will offer a better deal in the future rounds.  My gains will continue to shrink, while Bob's remain the same. It's best to accept the offer now and secure a decent share."
