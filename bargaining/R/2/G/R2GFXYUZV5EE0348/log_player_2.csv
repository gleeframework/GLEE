Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too generous towards yourself. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that the value decreases faster for me in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is still fair, considering the inflation affecting us both, but gives you a better share than the previous round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
