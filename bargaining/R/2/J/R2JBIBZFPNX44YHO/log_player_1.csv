"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more equitable. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain is now $700,000 x 0.95 = $665,000. Bob's gain is still $300,000.

I don't think a 60/40 split is equitable, considering the value of the money is decreasing for me. I'd rather not accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 60:40, but with a slight adjustment for inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
