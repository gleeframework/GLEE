I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though I'm getting less than I proposed, it's better to accept now.  The inflation is hurting me more than Bob, and if we go another round, I'll get even less!"
