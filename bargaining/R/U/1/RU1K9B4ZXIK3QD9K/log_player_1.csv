"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $90 and Bob $10. Since this is the first round, I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm also offering Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've lowered my offer slightly to 80/20.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where Bob will accept before the inflation continues to eat away at my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation is hurting, accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, even if it's much smaller than I initially hoped for.  Rejecting it risks getting nothing in the end."
