55.0,45.0,Let's start fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. I think this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we reverse it? This seems fair considering the inflation working against me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's be practical.  The inflation is hitting us both hard now.  A 50/50 split seems the fairest way to move forward.  It's better than risking further losses with more rounds.,Alice,3,
