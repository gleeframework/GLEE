"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you can take 40. We can discuss later if you're not happy.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better. I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I'd like a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is a good deal.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the money 50-50 this time. It's a fair compromise, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and make a more balanced offer, hoping Bob will consider it."
