Although the amount I'm getting is less than in the previous rounds, it is better to accept the offer now than to risk getting nothing if I reject it. The inflation is hurting Bob much more than me, so there is a strong possibility that he will continue to make increasingly worse offers in future rounds. Therefore, it is best to accept the offer now and secure some amount of money."
