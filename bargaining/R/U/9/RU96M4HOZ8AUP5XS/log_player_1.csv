"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game quickly before the money loses too much value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 60-40.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 65-35 is a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal, and the inflation penalty is higher for me, so I want to minimize the number of rounds.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nDue to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the second round, and 36% less than in the first round.
