"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, the split is heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share due to the inflation difference. This offer is more balanced, acknowledging the time pressure we both face."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, I've adjusted my offer slightly, still trying to find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still not equitable. The inflation disproportionately affects me, and a difference of $160,000 doesn't reflect that. I need to see a more significant shift to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing rapidly. This offer bridges the gap, ensuring we both benefit before inflation eats away at the entire amount."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, but I still believe my share should be higher. This is as low as I'm willing to go for now 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting ridiculous. While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer doesn't reflect the urgency. We're past the halfway point, and she's only budged $10,000 from her initial offer.  This stalls the negotiation while the value plummets, primarily hurting me. I need to signal I'm serious and willing to walk away if she doesn't negotiate fairly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 460000,
""alice_gain"": 540000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, but it's my final one. If you refuse, I'm walking away.  We both lose if we don't agree now.""
