"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be pragmatic. I'll take a slightly larger share, but we both still get a significant amount.  We can avoid further inflation this way. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
