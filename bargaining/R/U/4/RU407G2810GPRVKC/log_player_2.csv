"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10.  I'm sure we can find a better solution, but this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""My turn. Let's be reasonable. 60/40 seems fair considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split is the most reasonable now.  We both get a decent amount, and we don't risk losing everything with more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could aim for a higher share in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing everything due to inflation is too high. A 50/50 split ensures a reasonable gain for me.
