# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and while Alice is slowly increasing her offer, it's not enough to offset the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains.  It's time to push a bit harder and highlight the urgency."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, but I'll only give in a little 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, offering minimal increases while Bob's potential gains dwindle. It's risky, but Bob needs to hold firm and hope Alice breaks before the inflation makes any deal unfavorable."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This offer is more than fair considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, you're the one who's losing value 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough one, but the game dynamics have shifted dramatically. The inflation is crippling Bob's potential gains. While 45 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer carries a significant risk.  Alice knows Bob is cornered and might not budge further.  Accepting now guarantees something, whereas holding out for a slightly better deal might result in walking away with nothing."
