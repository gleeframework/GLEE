"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I made the first offer""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer!

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:
Alice gain: $400,000 x 0.8 = $320,000
Bob gain: $600,000 x 0.8 = $480,000

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal.

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
