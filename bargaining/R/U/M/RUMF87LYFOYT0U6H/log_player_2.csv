"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for us both to secure a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current split doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable, considering the inflation rate is higher for me than for Alice. I'll aim for a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering the inflation rates. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for both of us, especially with these inflation rates.  I'm offering a bit more than last time, but this is my final concession. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll have to consider the impact of inflation on the value of the money. Since the money is worth 19% less to me now, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly. Alice's offer is slightly better than before, but I'll calculate the actual value of the money to make a decision.

Let's calculate the actual value of the money for me:
$380,000 (nominal value) x 0.81 (1 - 0.19 inflation rate) = $307,800 (actual value)

Considering this, I'll make a decision.
