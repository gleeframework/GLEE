"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I think this is a fair split to start with. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's just the first round, and I think I can get a more favorable split. Besides, the money isn't losing value for me, so I'm not in a rush. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money loses value for you, it's better to settle sooner rather than later!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, Bob, but so is fairness. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is losing value for Alice, she's more pressured to settle than I am. I'll wait for a more favorable offer or try to negotiate a better split in the next round. The fact that Alice's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round gives me more bargaining power. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in value for you, I think this split is more reasonable. The sooner we settle, the more value you'll retain.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money.  Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand that a 50/50 split might seem fair under normal circumstances, but considering the significant loss of value for Alice due to inflation (59.04% less than in the first round), I believe I'm in a stronger negotiating position. The money isn't losing value for me, so I can afford to wait for a better offer or make a counteroffer that takes into account the current state of affairs. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the substantial decrease in value for you, I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to consider my own interests. This split reflects the current situation, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.  We need to find a compromise soon, or we both lose.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand Alice's frustration, but her ""final offer"" is actually less favorable to me than what I previously offered her. Given the extreme loss of value for Alice (73.79% less than in the first round), I believe I can push for an even better deal. Since the money isn't losing value for me, I'm not under the same pressure as Alice to settle quickly. I'm willing to risk proceeding to the next round to try and get an even more favorable split. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I understand you're feeling the pressure, but I've made more generous offers before that you've rejected. Given the current state of affairs, this is the best I'm willing to do. It's still a substantial amount for you, considering the circumstances.""}"
