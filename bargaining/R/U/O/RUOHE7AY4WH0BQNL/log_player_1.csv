"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this isn't a great deal, it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds.  The inflation means my potential gains will keep shrinking, and I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is. It's safer to take this offer."
