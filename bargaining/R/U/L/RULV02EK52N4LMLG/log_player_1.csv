"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I'm not sure about Bob's gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gain more significantly, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, with me getting 40 dollars and Bob getting 60 dollars. My message is a hint that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking for a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I need to keep some buffer for myself 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less, and I need to be more cautious with my decisions. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, considering the significant inflation has reduced the value of the money. I'm holding out for a slightly better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need some too""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35-65 split, with me getting 35 dollars and Bob getting 65 dollars. My message is a hint that I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a bigger share, but I still need to get something out of the deal."
