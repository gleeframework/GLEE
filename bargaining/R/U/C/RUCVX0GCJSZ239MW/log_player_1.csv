"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept to avoid any potential inflation risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more equal split, the inflation factor makes this offer significantly better for me than rejecting it and risking getting nothing in the end."
