"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous in this first round.  Let's see how you respond. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,000, it's clear Alice is trying to take the lion's share. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think my previous offer was fair. Let's come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is offering more, it's still not a fair split. I'm not going to settle for less than half the money. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a larger portion to make this worthwhile for me. This is my final offer.""}
