"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk to start with.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested in negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 in real terms.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'm not thrilled about giving up $6,000 to Bob, but I'm also not eager to keep negotiating if the offers aren't getting better.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain of $6,000 would be worth $4,800 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $4,000 would be worth $3,200 in real terms.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more aggressive now, Bob. I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount to keep you interested.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. The message is a bit more assertive, but still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less due to inflation, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $1,560 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is still worth $7,000 in real terms.

Considering the decreasing value of my potential gain, I'm not thrilled about giving up $7,000 to Bob, but I'm also not eager to keep negotiating if the offers aren't getting better.

However, I'll have to consider that the money is worth significantly less now, and I might need to be more aggressive to get a better deal.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 48.8% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 would be worth $2,048 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $6,000 would be worth $6,000 in real terms.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I'll take a smaller share, but I need to get something to make this worth my while.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing that I get $2,500 and Bob gets $7,500. The message is a bit more urgent, reflecting the decreasing value of the money."
