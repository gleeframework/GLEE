"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off on a good foot, Bob. I take a larger share, but you still get a decent chunk.  It's only going to go downhill from here with inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, that's not a good start. Inflation hurts, but let's be fair to each other. I'm proposing a more equitable split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. This offer still gives me a significant edge considering the inflation, but it's a lot closer to even than my last one.  Time is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the situation. While the offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential earnings."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a serious offer, and it's more than fair considering the inflation working against me.  Let's be reasonable and end this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting serious.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer gives you a decent share considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough. She's using the time pressure and inflation to her advantage. I need to hold out for a better deal."
