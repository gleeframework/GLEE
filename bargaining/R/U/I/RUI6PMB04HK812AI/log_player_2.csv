"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Advantage:** I'm offering Alice a bit less than half, aiming for a slight advantage for myself.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes that the value decreases over time, encouraging Alice to accept sooner rather than later. 
* **Appearance of Generosity:** By framing it as ""generosity,"" I try to make the offer seem more appealing and less likely to be immediately rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, it's only fair 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier! The inflation is starting to hurt, but it's still better to hold out for a better deal than accept a 42.5% share. I'm hoping she'll get more nervous as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. It's time to get serious.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is the most logical and fair outcome. By emphasizing this, I appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Continuing to play a game of chicken is risky. Accepting a slightly lower amount now is better than potentially getting stuck with an even worse deal later."
