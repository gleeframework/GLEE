"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm passing a friendly message to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer, but still a fair one. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 21% less for me now (10% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll have to be strategic.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if you'll accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not convinced. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me now (10% less in each of the three previous rounds), I'll have to be even more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with less than 20% of the original amount. I'll try to do better in the next round!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 30.1% less for me now (10% less in each of the four previous rounds), I'll have to be even more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up yet! I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse.""
}
```

I'm going back to my original offer from Round 2, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept it this time."
