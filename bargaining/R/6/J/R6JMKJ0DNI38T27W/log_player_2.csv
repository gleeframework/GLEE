Round 5

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is framing it as a ""generous"" second chance, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me.  I need to hold firm and hope she starts offering more reasonable amounts before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Your 50-50 offer was generous, but I think I can do a bit better 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing us! While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get from here on out. Alice is clearly trying to squeeze me, but waiting any longer is too risky."
