"Round 1

Let's see if I can get a better deal!  I'm not sure how Alice's offer will be affected by inflation, so it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, given that we're both taking a risk with this game. Let's see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 55-45 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to accept this offer. With inflation, my potential gains will be diminished in the future rounds.  Accepting a 45-55 split is a reasonable outcome."
