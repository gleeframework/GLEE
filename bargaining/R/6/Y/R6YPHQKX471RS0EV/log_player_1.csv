"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting a relatively fair split, but slightly in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting our relative bargaining power in this game. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a larger share""}\n\nI'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation that's affecting his potential gain, but still trying to maintain a favorable split for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but 55/45 is the best I can offer given the inflation. Let's reach an agreement before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer again, as I think the inflation is affecting his gain significantly, and I can try to get an even better deal in the next round. The pressure is on Bob to make a more favorable offer before the inflation gets even worse for him. Let's see what happens next!

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Inflation is killing your share. I'm being generous here.""}\n\nI'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself than the previous one, while still appearing to be a compromise. The message is designed to put pressure on Bob, reminding him that the inflation is working against him, and that he should accept this offer before things get even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm willing to compromise a little further.  48/52 is the best I can do at this point.  Let's avoid further losses and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, I think 52/48 is a relatively good deal for me. Further rounds would likely lead to even more desperate offers from Bob, but there's also a risk that he might decide to hold out, and we'd both end up with nothing. I'd rather take the sure thing at this point.
