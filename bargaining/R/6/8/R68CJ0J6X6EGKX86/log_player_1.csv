I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money! I'll offer Bob 100,000 and keep 900,000 for myself.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting much less than I originally wanted, it's still better than getting nothing.  With inflation, my share is going to keep shrinking, so it's better to take what I can get now.  I'm not going to be greedy and risk losing everything!"
