"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining 10% of the money in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to get the ball rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 4:1, a fair and reasonable offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 200,000 is actually 180,000 in real terms.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, my gain of 180,000 is now 162,000 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! Take this and let's end this soon!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but not too greedy, since I don't know how Bob's perception of value is affected by inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, as I'm still the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, my gain of 400,000 is actually 292,800 in real terms.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, my gain of 292,800 is now 212,016 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob! I'm starting to think you're not serious about ending this soon.""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a better deal, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to compromise and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 40.95% less than the original amount, my gain of 500,000 is actually 296,500 in real terms.

I'll accept this offer. Splitting it evenly seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
