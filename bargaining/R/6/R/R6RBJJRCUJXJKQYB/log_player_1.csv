"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering I'm giving you a chance to counteroffer if you don't like it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  We're approaching a third of the way through with nothing. I propose an even split to avoid both of us losing out.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, and I think I can get more. Inflation is starting to take its toll, but I'm not desperate yet. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to push his luck, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. While the deal is getting worse, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not a good strategy at this point. I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to get this done.  Don't be greedy, or we both lose!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still confident I can get more, despite the inflation. You seem more desperate than I am. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While the pressure is definitely on, this offer is far too low. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation, but accepting this would mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings. I need to stand my ground and hope Bob starts getting nervous as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""bob_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a compromise. It's not an even split, but it's far better than what you've been proposing.  We're running out of time, and I'm serious about not getting zero!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal I'm willing to compromise, but not surrender.  Offering a deal slightly better than his last but still in his favor might be enough to break the stalemate. The threat of getting nothing is becoming very real, and he needs to see I'm aware of that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more than before, but I still think I deserve the larger share. Inflation is hurting, but I won't back down yet. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but time is running out. Bob increased his offer slightly, and while it's still not ideal, accepting avoids the risk of getting nothing. Accepting a 42/58 split at this stage is better than holding out for a better deal and ending up with nothing if Bob refuses to budge."
