"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45, with a message that suggests we're splitting it fairly, but with a slight bias towards me, of course! Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it this way, since you got the better deal last time. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:\n\n```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise.""
}
```

I've taken into account the 5% decrease in value for me and 0% for Bob, and adjusted my offer accordingly. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob!"
