"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a lower amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal, but I'm still not getting the short end of the stick""
}
```

This offer takes into account the increased inflation and gives me a slightly higher share, while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a slight increase from his previous offer, but it still doesn't quite meet my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking its toll, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need a better deal""
}
```

This offer takes into account the significant decrease in value of money and gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
