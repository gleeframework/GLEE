"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division: 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Alice's proposal is quite biased, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Please let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more reasonable. Since Alice seems to value her time and wants to end this quickly, I'll try to find a middle ground. Given the 10% inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}"
