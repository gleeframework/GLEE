"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I believe this split reflects the advantage I have with the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject the offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I need to see how the inflation affects Alice's decisions in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I believe this offer is more fair, taking into account the inflation factor. It gives you a good starting point, and it's the best deal I can offer right now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to reflect the fact that the value decreases for me with each round. This offer is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept the offer. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and I'm happy to secure a decent portion of the money before the value depreciates further."
