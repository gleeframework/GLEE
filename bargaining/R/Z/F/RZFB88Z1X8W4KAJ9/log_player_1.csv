"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer to see how Bob reacts.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate or if he'll take the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This offer is much fairer than my first proposal.  I'll accept it and move on."
