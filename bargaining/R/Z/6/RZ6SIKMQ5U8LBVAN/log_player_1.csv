"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob will be tempted to take it since he's getting something, and if he rejects it, he'll get even less in the next round due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to be greedy, even though he's getting less due to the inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 850,000 for myself, giving Bob 150,000.  He's losing money with each round, so I'm hoping he'll be tempted to accept before the inflation eats away too much more of his potential share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with each round, but his offer is still far too low.  The inflation is really hurting him, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 820000, ""bob_gain"": 180000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer than last time, to see if I can entice Bob to take it. The inflation is starting to really impact him, so I'm hoping he'll see that this is a decent deal before he loses even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While the inflation is hitting him hard, it's not enough for him to accept such an unbalanced split. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob now. I'm going to offer him a slightly lower amount than my previous offer, but still a decent share. I'm hoping the fear of losing even more due to inflation will push him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is finally offering an even split. Even though it's less than what I've been offering, the inflation has really started to hit him hard. At this point, it's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
