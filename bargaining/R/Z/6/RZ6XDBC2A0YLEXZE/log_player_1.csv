"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from there""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair and reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with 50/50, but I think I can do better than that. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a slightly lower offer, but 4000 is a bit more than I was hoping for.

However, considering the inflation, 4000 is actually a good deal for me, as it's worth 80% of what 5000 was in the previous round. I'll accept this offer.
