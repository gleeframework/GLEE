"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  This is a fair initial offer, and I believe it is in both of our best interests to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the initial offer was much better, I'd rather take the 50/50 split now. The inflation is making the value of the money decrease rapidly, and waiting for another round is risky."
