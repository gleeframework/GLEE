"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 7:3, a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the negotiations!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'll make a decision. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking at a gain of $300,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up even more.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my initial offer, but still gives Bob a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's get closer, 55.5-44.5, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

After considering Bob's new offer, I notice that he's trying to get closer to my previous offer, but still slightly favoring himself. However, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of $450,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer.

I'll accept this offer, as it's getting closer to a fair compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
