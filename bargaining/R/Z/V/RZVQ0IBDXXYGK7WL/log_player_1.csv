Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split.  I'm being generous, but I want to make sure I get the most while the money is still worth something!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my previous one, even after considering inflation. I'm still in a strong position and can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still offering Bob a share, but I'm reducing my offer slightly due to inflation.  I believe this is still a fair deal, considering Bob's offer in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for him than my previous offers due to inflation.  Even though the money is worth less for me, this is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  It's time to take the deal!"
