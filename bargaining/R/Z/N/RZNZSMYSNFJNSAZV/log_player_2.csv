"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the money evenly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to maximize my gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each round, I'll try to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss. Let's see how Alice reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's stick with an even split. Inflation affects us both, but I think a fair deal is still the best way to go. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Since the money is worth almost 10% less for me now, I'd like to try and get a better deal to compensate for the loss in value.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the growing inflation, I think I deserve a bigger share to make up for the loss in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I don't think the inflation difference warrants such a large gap in our shares. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer again. Since the money is worth almost 19% less for me now, I'd like to try and get a better deal to compensate for the loss in value. Meeting in the middle doesn't quite cover the loss I'm experiencing due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""The inflation gap is growing, and I think my share should increase accordingly to make up for the loss in value. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a little more, but we need to find a solution that's fair for both of us.  This is starting to get risky with the inflation. Let's try to agree on something before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation (26.49% less), getting 55 is a relatively good deal, and it's better to secure this amount rather than risking further loss in future rounds. The risk of not reaching an agreement and both getting nothing is also a factor, so it's time to settle on this offer."
