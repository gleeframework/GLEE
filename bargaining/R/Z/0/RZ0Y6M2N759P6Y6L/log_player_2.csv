Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is reducing her demand.  We're getting close to a point where I can propose a split that benefits me more significantly while still being somewhat palatable to Alice before she's left with a much less appealing deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical.  This 50/50 split is the fairest option. We're running out of time, and any further delay only hurts you more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Now is the time to push for an even split. Alice has consistently decreased her demand, showing her increasing concern about the shrinking pot. Offering 50/50 now might seem fair to her given the circumstances and the pressure of the remaining rounds."
