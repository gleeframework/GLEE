Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This is a pretty generous offer, but it's important to get a deal done early to avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation means my potential gains in future rounds are significantly lower. Accepting this offer guarantees me $4,000, which is better than the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
