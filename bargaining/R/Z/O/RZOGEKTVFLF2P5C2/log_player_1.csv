"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $25. This way, we both get a fair share considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While the money is losing value, a larger initial share for me helps us both in the long run. Let's finish this quickly and move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
