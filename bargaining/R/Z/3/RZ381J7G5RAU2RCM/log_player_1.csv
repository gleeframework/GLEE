  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you'll take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
