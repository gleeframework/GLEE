Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, now the deal is a bit worse for you.

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final' offer wasn't good enough, now it's my turn again. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is getting progressively worse, I still have time and believe I can get a better deal. Accepting now would be letting her win by wearing me down."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my earlier offers, now I'm less willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but I'm not desperate yet.  While the inflation is hurting, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Alice would be a mistake. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if she becomes more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 8

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still not willing to give in. This is my best offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, and the inflation is getting severe. However, accepting this offer means I lose almost two-thirds of the potential gains. With three rounds left, I think there's still a chance Alice will crack under the pressure of losing everything.  I'm hoping she sees that something is better than nothing as we approach the deadline."
