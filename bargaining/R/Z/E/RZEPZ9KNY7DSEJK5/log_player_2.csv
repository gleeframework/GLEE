Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round, and this back-and-forth isn't beneficial for either of us. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
