"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** My gains are worth 5% less, but Bob's gains are worth 20% less. This means the relative value of Bob's offer is more favorable to me than my original offer.
* **Potential for Further Rounds:** While I could reject and propose my own offer, there's no guarantee Bob will accept it.  Further rounds could lead to even lower gains for both of us due to inflation. 
* **Value of Certainty:**  Accepting the offer guarantees me a gain, even if it's less than I initially wanted. Rejecting could lead to no gain at all."
