"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer in this round. I'm aiming for a high initial gain, knowing that inflation will reduce the value of the money for me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than the risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation.  Even though my share is worth 5% less now, accepting guarantees me half the money."
