"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose a very uneven split, giving Bob $1 and keeping $999,999 for myself. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob rejects it, I'll get to propose again in the next round. It's unlikely he'll reject this offer in the first round, but if he does, I'll have to adapt my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
