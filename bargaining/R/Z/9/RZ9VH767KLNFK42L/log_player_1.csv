"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather get more money in the current round than risk waiting for a better offer.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
