"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get 60 and you get 40.  We should settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a fair offer in the current round, Bob should reject.  He knows that in the next round, he will be able to propose a better split for himself. By waiting, he can take advantage of Alice's higher inflation rate, making his own potential gains higher."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair deal, Alice.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  Inflation is going to hurt us both, so let's get this over with quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is getting worse for both of us with each round. I'll take a little less, but this needs to end now. 55/45, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob could theoretically wait for another round and potentially get a better deal, the risk of further inflation is too high. Alice's offer is still a good one, and accepting it ensures Bob gets a decent amount before inflation eats away at his potential gains further."
