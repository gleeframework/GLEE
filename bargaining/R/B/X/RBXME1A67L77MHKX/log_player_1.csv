Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small share.  I'm going to try and maximize my share right from the start."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While 500,000 is a lot of money, I know I can do better. I'm not going to settle for an even split, especially since I'm facing inflation.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 100,000. I'm still aiming for the majority, but I'm going to be a bit more generous this time. Inflation is a factor, and I need to convince Bob to accept before it becomes too costly for me to keep pushing."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While 300,000 is a decent amount, it's far less than what I was aiming for, especially considering the inflation. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.  Let's see what the next round brings."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000. While inflation is biting, I'm still holding out for a good chunk of the money. I'm going to try to make a deal that's fair enough for Bob to accept but still leaves me with the majority of the money."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While 400,000 is still a significant amount of money,  I'm not willing to settle for such a low share, especially considering the impact of inflation. It seems Bob is pushing for a larger share, and I need to be more assertive to get a fair deal. Let's see what the next round brings."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob 400,000. Inflation is making each round more difficult, and I need to be more reasonable.  This offer is still favorable to me, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair deal and accept."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While 450,000 is a lot of money, I'm not willing to settle for less than 50% of the money, especially since Bob's share is getting larger with each round. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.  I need to make a strong offer in the next round to see if I can get Bob to accept a deal closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 450,000. Inflation has really taken its toll, and with only a few rounds left, I need to compromise. This offer is a 55/45 split in my favor, which is still a decent amount. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left, inflation is hitting hard.  While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures that I'll walk away with a significant amount of money."
