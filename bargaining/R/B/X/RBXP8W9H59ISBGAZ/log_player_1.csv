"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less, so I'm getting $400,000, which is $200,000 less than in the first round. Bob's share is worth 5% less, so he's getting $570,000.

I'm not thrilled about the unequal split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation. I'll accept this offer.
