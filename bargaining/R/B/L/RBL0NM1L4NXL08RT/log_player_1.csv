"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $900,000 and leave $100,000 for Bob. It's a pretty generous offer, considering the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob."
