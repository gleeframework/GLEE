"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher share, but still keep a decent chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob. I need a bigger share to make this worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful.

However, Bob's offer seems slightly better than before, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject it.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
