Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the value of the money will decrease in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough considering the rapid devaluation of my potential earnings. I'm willing to gamble that he'll propose something more reasonable in the next round."
