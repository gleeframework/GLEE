"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to get us moving.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but I'm still giving Bob a decent share to make the game worth playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I'd rather not split it down the middle, as I'd rather have a larger share of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next offer from Bob."

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time.""
