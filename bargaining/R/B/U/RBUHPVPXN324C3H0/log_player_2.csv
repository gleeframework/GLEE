"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split.  We both get a good amount, and we can move on with our lives.  What do you say?""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. I'm adjusting my offer to be more equitable. It's a win-win! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd still prefer my previous offer, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
