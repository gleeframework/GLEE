# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's offer, I'll consider it carefully. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have $8,000, which is a significant amount.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the previous rounds and the effect of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to increase my share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This offer gives me $9,000 and Bob $1,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation that has occurred, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have $8,000, which is a good amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
