"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation in mind, I need to consider that the $900,000 Bob is offering is worth 10% less than the $1,000,000 in the first round. So, in today's value, it's equivalent to $900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000.

Considering this, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

I'll reject the offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was $900,000, I'll make a new offer that's slightly higher. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more generous this time. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Since the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than the original $1,000,000, I need to calculate the equivalent value in today's dollars. $700,000 * 0.723 = $504,100.

Considering this, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal. Let's meet in the middle!""

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Since the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than the original $1,000,000, I need to calculate the equivalent value in today's dollars. $550,000 * 0.591 = $325,450.
