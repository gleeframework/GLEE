"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering we both need to agree. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said 55-45 is fair, I'll meet you in the middle!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
