"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if you'll accept this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider this offer carefully.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a 50/50 split, I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You were close last time, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my next best offer.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $6,000, which is a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'm being generous. Will you accept this time? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll consider this new offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although I was aiming for a higher share, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and $4,000 is still a significant amount for me. I think it's better to accept and lock in this deal rather than risking getting even less in future rounds."
