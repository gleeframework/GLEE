Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves me with a significant advantage, Bob, but ensures you get something before inflation eats into it too much. Let's be pragmatic. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is generous, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable solution, and it avoids the risk of inflation eroding our gains in later rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a fair split. However, I need you to factor in the initial round advantage and the escalating inflation. This offer is a compromise, and I believe it's the best path forward. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, I'm still hoping for a more balanced split. I'll see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to budge a bit further, but I need to see a more balanced split to avoid losing too much to inflation. This offer is a compromise that takes into account the impact of inflation on both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each round. This offer is a serious one, acknowledging your need for a larger share while still reflecting the initial advantage.  Let's close this deal and walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would still prefer a more balanced split, Alice's offer is the best I've seen so far. We're running out of time, and further negotiation risks both of us getting nothing. Accepting this offer secures a substantial gain for me, despite the inflation."
