"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm starting with a high offer for myself (95%) because I don't know how inflation will affect Bob's decision. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to accept quickly and avoid any potential inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, I'm still getting a significant portion of the money, and accepting now avoids the risk of further inflation eroding my share in future rounds."
