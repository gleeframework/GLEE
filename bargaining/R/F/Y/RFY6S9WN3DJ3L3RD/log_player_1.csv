I propose taking 900,000 for myself, and leaving Bob with 100,000. This is a good starting point, considering the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing to take 800,000 for myself, leaving Bob with 200,000.  Inflation is now a factor, and I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the decreased value of my gains.  This offer is fair given the circumstances."
