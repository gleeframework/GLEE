I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for a 90/10 split. This is a risky move, as Bob might reject it.  However, with inflation coming into play, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the 20% inflation makes accepting Bob's offer the best option. I'll get a decent amount ($5,000) which is worth more than the risk of rejecting and potentially getting a smaller share later due to inflation."
