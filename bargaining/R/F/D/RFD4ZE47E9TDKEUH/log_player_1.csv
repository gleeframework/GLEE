"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think about it... Hmm, I'd rather get a larger share than 40. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting! Okay, let me think...

Hmm, 42 is still a relatively small share, but I don't want to risk going lower. I'll take it.
