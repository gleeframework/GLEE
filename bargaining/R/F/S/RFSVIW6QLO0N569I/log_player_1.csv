"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering you $30, which is a generous 30% of the original $100. I'm hoping you'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation.  Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $36. Bob's gain of $60 is worth $54.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll accept it.
