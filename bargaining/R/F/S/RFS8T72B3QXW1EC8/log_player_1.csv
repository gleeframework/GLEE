Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the situation is pressuring you more than me. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, making it unlikely he will budge further in future rounds. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While 5200 is less than I aimed for initially, it's still better than what I'd get if I reject and receive a worse offer in a later round due to inflation. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes accepting a less than ideal offer is the best strategic move in a negotiation with diminishing returns."
