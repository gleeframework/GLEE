I propose keeping 90$ for myself and giving 10$ to Bob. This gives me a significant head start, and Bob still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still going for a larger share, but I'm willing to concede a bit more to Bob. With inflation, the money he gets is worth less, so hopefully this will be tempting enough."
