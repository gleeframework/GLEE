"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll get the bigger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, where I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 60-40 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,600.

I accept Bob's offer for a 60-40 split, where I get $4,000 and Bob gets $6,000.
