"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to get started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 60/40, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of its original value, which is $3200. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $6000 remains the same.

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I think this offer is more reasonable. I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
