Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid any further rounds with potential inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
