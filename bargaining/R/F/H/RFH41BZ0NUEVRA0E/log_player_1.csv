Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split.  I figure Bob is likely to be more agreeable to a small amount now rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's clear Bob is willing to take the lion's share.  Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and with each round the value of the remaining amount decreases.  It's better to take what I can get now."
