"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though it's slightly worse than my initial offer, accepting is the best option. If I reject and we go to another round, the money will be worth even less."
