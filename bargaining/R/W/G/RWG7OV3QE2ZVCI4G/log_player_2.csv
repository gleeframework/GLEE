"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Since I'm playing as Bob, I want to see if I can get a better deal than 50/50.  I know there's inflation, so I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's try this compromise. 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I lose a bit more due to inflation, 580,000 is still a decent amount.  It's better than risking going another round and getting an even worse deal due to inflation.  I'll take the compromise."
