"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take advantage of the inflation, eh?

I'll think carefully... With the inflation, the 60/40 split is actually a more favorable deal for Bob than it initially seems, since his share is worth more than 60% of the original $1,000,000. I'm not sure I want to give up that much.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to counter Bob's 60/40 offer with a new proposal that takes into account the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's try this compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the initial 50/50, but still gives Bob a decent share."
