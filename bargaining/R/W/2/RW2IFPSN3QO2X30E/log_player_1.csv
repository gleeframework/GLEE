Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair start, let's see if we can improve from here!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to see if we can find a better split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a more even split. Let's see if we can make it work! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, as I was hoping for a slightly more favorable outcome. I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a more even split than Bob's original offer, but still slightly favors me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and accept this offer."
