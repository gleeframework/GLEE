"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the initial split seems fair on the surface, Alice is losing value much faster than I am due to the inflation rates. It's in my best interest to wait a few rounds. This will put pressure on Alice to offer a larger share in the future to avoid losing out as the value diminishes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but the split needs to reflect the decreasing value. Let's try this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Advantage:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, I've signaled that I understand the game's dynamics. 
* **Time Pressure:** Alice now sees her potential share decreasing faster with each passing round. 
* **Justification:** I've offered a slightly more favorable split to myself, acknowledging the inflation difference, but still leaving room for negotiation. My message aims to sound reasonable and open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on your adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is feeling the pressure:** Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" on my previous adjustment shows the inflation is significantly impacting her potential gains. 
* **Still in a strong position:** While the money is losing value for me too, my rate is much slower. I can afford to be a bit more patient.
* **Aiming for a better deal:** I believe Alice will be forced to offer an even larger share in the next round to make it worthwhile for her to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice. This offer reflects the reality of our situation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the tables:** I'm now proposing a split that favors me more than Alice's original ""fair"" offer.  This is justified by the significant decrease in value she's experiencing.
* **Sense of urgency:** The message emphasizes that time is working against Alice, urging her to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving room for agreement:**  While this offer is strategically advantageous, it's not outrageous. It leaves Alice with a reasonable amount, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We both lose if we don't agree soon. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting desperate:** Her message clearly shows concern about reaching an agreement soon. The inflation is significantly eroding her potential gain, pushing her towards a deal.
* **Still room for improvement:** While her offer is getting closer to a reasonable split considering the inflation, it's still not quite there yet. 
* **Calculated risk:**  I'm willing to risk another round of rejection. I believe Alice will be forced to offer a larger portion in the next round to avoid walking away with a significantly devalued share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 625000,
""alice_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Let's close this out and avoid losing even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm applying maximum pressure on Alice to reach an agreement.  
* **Strategic Increase:** I've slightly increased my share from my previous offer, signaling a firm stance while still leaving a decent sum for Alice.
* **Time Factor:** With less than half the rounds remaining, both of us should be feeling the urgency to avoid walking away with nothing. This offer aims to capitalize on that pressure."
