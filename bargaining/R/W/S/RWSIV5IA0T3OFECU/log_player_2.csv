"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $5200, you get $4800.  It's important to reach a deal quickly because the money loses value with each round. Think about it! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's split this evenly. 50/50 ensures we both benefit and avoids further loss from inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out!  My last offer was more than fair. I'm adjusting slightly: $5100 for me, $4900 for you. Let's settle this before we both lose out! 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While her offer is incrementally better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about a fairer division.  We're still early enough in the game to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to a 50/50 split. This is about fairness, not trying to outsmart each other. Let's end this and both benefit.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm making one last concession to demonstrate my willingness to compromise. $5050 for me, $4950 for you.  After this, I'm aiming for a larger share since you're letting valuable time slip away. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While still not a 50/50 split, Alice's offer is now very close to even. Given the increasing pressure from inflation and her statement about aiming for a larger share in future rounds, accepting this offer mitigates potential losses and guarantees a reasonable payout."
