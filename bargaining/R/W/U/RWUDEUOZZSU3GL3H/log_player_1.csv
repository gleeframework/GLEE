"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a fair split, giving us both an equal share of $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $5,000 from Round 1 is now worth $4,762.50.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
