"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose we keep most of the money for ourselves, but give Bob a small amount to make it worthwhile for him to accept the offer. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and gives me a decent share of the money. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too high."
