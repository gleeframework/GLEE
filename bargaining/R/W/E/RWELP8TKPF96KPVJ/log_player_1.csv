Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

In this round, my gain of $550,000 is worth 90% of the original $600,000, so it's equivalent to $540,000. Bob's gain of $450,000 is worth 95% of the original $400,000, so it's equivalent to $420,000.
