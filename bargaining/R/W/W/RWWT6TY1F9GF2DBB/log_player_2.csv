Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Alice will take this deal. I'm going for the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is better than what I proposed in round 2, and after inflation, I'm not sure I can do much better. Let's take it!"
