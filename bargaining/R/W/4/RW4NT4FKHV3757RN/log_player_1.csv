Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in Round 1 was rejected, and now Bob is making an offer in Round 2. However, I notice that his offer is not a new one, but rather the same as my original offer, with the money being worth 20% less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer as well.
