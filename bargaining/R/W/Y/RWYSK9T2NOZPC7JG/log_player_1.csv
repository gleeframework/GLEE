"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with a small percentage.  This is a strong opening offer, as it gives me the maximum possible gain in the first round. However, it's important to keep in mind that Bob's money will depreciate much faster than mine with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still very generous to him, even with the inflation.  While I could accept and get something, I'm still in a good position to get a better deal.  I'll reject and see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself.  Bob's money is depreciating quickly, so he may be more willing to accept a smaller share than in the previous round.  I'll keep testing the waters and see how much I can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming less attractive due to the escalating inflation affecting his gains. I'm still in a stronger position, so I'll keep rejecting and aiming for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, hoping to make it more enticing to Bob. With each passing round, the pressure on him is growing due to the inflation. I believe this offer strikes a good balance between securing a significant portion for myself and potentially reaching an agreement."
