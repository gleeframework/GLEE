"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000, the rest is mine""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me taking $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000. My message to Bob is to consider this a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split because I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'm willing to consider a 60-40 split or better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% of its original value now, due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need more. You can have $300,000, I'll take the rest""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me taking $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 50/50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased further due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's new offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of a 60-40 split, with me taking $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. It's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money."
