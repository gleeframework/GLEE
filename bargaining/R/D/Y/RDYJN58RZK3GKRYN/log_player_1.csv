"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, taking 70% of the remaining amount. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is now worth 90% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 460,000 dollars, which is 46% of the remaining amount. This is a reasonable offer, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another aggressive offer from Bob! The money is worth significantly less than it was initially, and Bob is still trying to take the majority of it. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is now worth 72.9% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm repeating my offer from round 3, as the value of the money has decreased, but the proportions remain the same. I'm still offering Bob 46% of the remaining amount."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to take the majority of the remaining amount. However, considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather get something than risk waiting for an even lower offer in the next round."
