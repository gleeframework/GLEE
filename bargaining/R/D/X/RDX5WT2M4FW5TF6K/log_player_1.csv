"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share, but I'm looking for a majority stake.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'm willing to give you a small share, but you have to be more generous! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was being a bit too greedy, wasn't I?

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to think about the long-term consequences.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not settle for a small share and risk losing even more value in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle and split it fairly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more moderate offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my range, but I still think I deserve more. Don't be too generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Considering the significant drop in value, I'll have to be even more cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

However, I'll make a note that my gain is now worth significantly less than it was initially, and I'll have to consider that in my next offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, I'm willing to meet you halfway and avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this fair offer and we can finally settle the division of the money."
