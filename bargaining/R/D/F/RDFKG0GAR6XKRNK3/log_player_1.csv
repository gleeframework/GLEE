I'm taking a greedy approach. Since the money is worth less for Bob with each round, I'm offering him a tiny amount to try and get him to accept quickly. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's unlikely Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round. With the inflation factor, his money will be worth even less, and I'm sure he'll try to get the best deal for himself. Accepting now secures at least half the money."
