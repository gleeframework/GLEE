"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. It's a good offer for you in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation isn't a big deal yet, and I think I can get a better deal than $30."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I think 45-55 is a fair deal, considering the inflation. Let's split the difference!""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is working against you, but my offer is still quite generous. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses for you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the inflation is taking its toll, I still think I can negotiate a better deal than $35, considering Alice is trying to settle quickly. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 42-58 seems reasonable. Let's end this before the money loses more value!""}"
