"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the original amount, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 450000 x 0.95 = 427500
* Bob gain: 550000 x 0.95 = 522500

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
