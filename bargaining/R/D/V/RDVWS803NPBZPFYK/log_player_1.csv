Let's see if Bob takes my generous offer!  ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of inflation!  I'll make a better offer next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to try to split the difference, but still keep a majority share.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, even though inflation is hurting me. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference again, but with a higher amount for me.  I'm hoping Bob realizes that the longer we go, the less we both get due to inflation."
