"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering we both have to take a chance in this game.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is the inverse of Alice's, accepting now avoids further inflation.  A 45/55 split is better than risking an even worse outcome in future rounds."
