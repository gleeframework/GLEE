"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable proposal. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, no need to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my potential for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the effects of inflation, my offer will be slightly more aggressive this time around. I'll propose a 6:4 split in my favor, hoping to take advantage of the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer a 6:4 split. Will you accept?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise on a 6:4 split, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's compromise is a good one. I'm not sure if I want to push for more, as the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that the reduced value of the money will make up for the slightly lower amount.
