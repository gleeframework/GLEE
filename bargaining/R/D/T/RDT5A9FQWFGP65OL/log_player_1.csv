"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a fair split, but I'm trying to get the majority of the money to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer since Bob is trying to get the majority. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer will be slightly more aggressive. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm still trying to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a 50/50 split. I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth significantly less for me now, I might be willing to accept a smaller share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer."
