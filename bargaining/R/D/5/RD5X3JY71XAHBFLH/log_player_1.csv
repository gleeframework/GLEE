"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we start with a fair and equal division to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split in my favor. I'll wait for his next proposal, hoping to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but a bit more towards me this time""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55/45 split, trying to nudge the division in my favor a bit more."

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as I still think I can do better. His offer is still a 45/55 split, which is not favorable to me. I'll wait for his next proposal, hoping to get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his 50/50 proposal. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as I'm still hoping to get a better deal. A 50/50 split is not as favorable to me as I'd like, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{

# Bob gain: 4200

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. A 58/42 split is still not ideal, but it's a better deal than a 50/50 split, and I'm getting closer to my target. I'll take it."
