"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, and leaving 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get more. I'll reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth much less, I'll aim to get a larger share. However, Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, which is relatively close to the previous offers. I'll decide to accept this offer.
