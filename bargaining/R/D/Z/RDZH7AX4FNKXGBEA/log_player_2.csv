Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to give me the smaller share, but I think I can do a bit better. Let's meet in the middle from our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but it's still early in the game.  The impact of inflation is not yet severe enough for me to accept an offer where I get significantly less than half. By continuing to reject, I signal I'm willing to play hardball and increase the pressure on her as the rounds progress."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but this is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** By mirroring her offer from Round 3, I show a willingness to compromise but maintain a firm stance. This subtle shift might be enough to sway her.
* **Time Pressure:**  Emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation adds urgency. Alice might be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds.
* **Finality:**  Stating it's my final offer increases the perceived risk for Alice if she rejects it. She now has to consider whether she's willing to gamble on getting a better deal in later rounds, with the potential of walking away with nothing."
