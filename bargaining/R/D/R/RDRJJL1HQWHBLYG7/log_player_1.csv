"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000, which is slightly more than half, considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases more significantly for me than for Bob. This initial offer aims to balance the devaluation while still appearing fair and enticing enough for Bob to accept early on, minimizing the loss for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair, but the inflation hits you harder than me. This is a fairer split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting this offer would mean I, Alice, would actually receive less value than initially proposed, considering the 20% devaluation for me. It's strategic to reject and propose a new division that takes into account the second round's value adjustments, aiming to maximize my gain or find a more equitable split under the current conditions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the increased loss from inflation, this adjustment is necessary.""}\n\nIn this round, considering the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the initial round, I've adjusted the proposal. The aim is to compensate for the greater loss I incur with each round while still presenting Bob with a substantial amount, albeit less than before due to his lower devaluation rate. This strategy pressures Bob to consider the increasing loss over time and the possibility of walking away with less if the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This split accounts for the inflation disparity while still being reasonable for both of us. Let's close the deal before it gets any worse. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, with a 48.8% devaluation by this round, it becomes increasingly risky to continue negotiations. Bob's offer, while not ideal, presents a more stable option than further rounds would likely yield. The difference in our devaluation rates makes each subsequent round less favorable for me. Accepting this offer now minimizes further loss and secures a substantial amount, considering the rapidly diminishing value of the money."
