"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair (but not too fair) split. I'll take the bigger share, but you'll still get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept a proposal that gives me only 100,000 out of a million dollars, especially since we have so many rounds left.  Let's see if Alice will make a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
