"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer that takes into account the inflation factor, where I get a slightly higher amount to offset the loss in value over time. Let's see if Alice accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than the last one. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer from round 3. Given the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The current offer doesn't sufficiently compensate for the 36% decrease in value I'm facing. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I need a larger share to offset the loss. This is my best offer so far.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing pressure from inflation, where my gain is now worth 36% less, I've decided to make a more assertive offer. I'm hoping Alice will understand the urgency and accept this proposal, as further rounds will only exacerbate the loss for both of us. Fingers crossed!"
