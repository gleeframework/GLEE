"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer. Since Bob's money is losing value faster than mine, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. With each round, my share of the money stays the same while his depreciates, so I can afford to wait."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Since his money is losing value more quickly, I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more favorable, and his money is losing value rapidly.  I'm happy to take this deal and end the game."
