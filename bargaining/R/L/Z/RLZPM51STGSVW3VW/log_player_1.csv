"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I believe I deserve a slightly larger portion for being the one to make the first offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the offer is still quite generous from Bob's perspective. However, I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since I was the one who made the first offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less than before, and I need to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said I deserved a smaller share for making the first offer, but now it's my turn. I'm offering a 55-45 split. Accept and we can move forward!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
