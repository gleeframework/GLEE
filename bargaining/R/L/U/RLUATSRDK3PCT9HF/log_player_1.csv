"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start negotiating!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of you rejecting this and getting less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

Given Bob's proposal, I think a 60/40 split is a bit too skewed towards him, especially considering he's trying to take advantage of the risk of me rejecting this offer and getting less in the next round. I'm not willing to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 20% twice, my potential gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. I'd like to make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 42% is a fair share considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which I believe is a reasonable compromise given the reduced value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
