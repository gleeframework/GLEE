Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 42% is a fair share considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting late, and with the inflation, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. Let's take the 580,000!"
