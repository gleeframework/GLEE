"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and hopefully get him to accept the offer early on, avoiding further rounds where the value of the money decreases for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because it gives him the larger share, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, especially considering that the value of the money remains the same for me but decreases for Bob with each round. By rejecting, I'll get the chance to propose another offer that could be more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $57 and Bob receives $43. The message ""Consider the inflation"" is a reminder to Bob that with each passing round, the value of the money he receives decreases by 5%, making it beneficial for him to accept the offer sooner rather than later. I'm taking advantage of this dynamic to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim that the offer accounts for inflation, the split is still not favorable enough for me, especially considering that the value of the money hasn't decreased for me. Given that Bob is under more pressure due to the decreasing value of his potential gain, I believe I can push for an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, settle now""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. The message ""Inflation is biting, settle now"" is a reminder to Bob that the longer we negotiate, the less valuable his share becomes due to inflation. By this round, Bob's potential gain is worth significantly less than at the start, making it increasingly advantageous for him to accept the offer and stop the value from decreasing further. I'm leveraging this pressure to propose an even more favorable split for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of an even split because, considering the significant decrease in value that Bob's share has undergone due to inflation, an even split at this point is not as equitable as it seems. Given that my share's value has not decreased, I am in a stronger negotiating position. Bob's declaration that this is his final offer could be a bluff, and given the circumstances, I believe I can still push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's too late""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $62 and Bob receives $38. The message ""Last chance before it's too late"" emphasizes to Bob that the value of his potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and if he doesn't accept this offer, he risks losing even more value in subsequent rounds. By this point, Bob's share has decreased significantly in value, and I'm using this leverage to push for an even more favorable split, testing his resolve and patience in the negotiation."
