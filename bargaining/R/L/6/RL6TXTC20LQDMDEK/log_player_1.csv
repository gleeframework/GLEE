"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'll give Bob the larger share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd rather get a higher share now rather than risk waiting for a potentially better offer. I accept the offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
