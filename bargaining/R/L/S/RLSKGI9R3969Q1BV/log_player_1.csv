"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
