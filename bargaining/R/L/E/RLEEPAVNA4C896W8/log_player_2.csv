"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer represents a fair split considering the decreasing value of money with each round. Please consider it. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message emphasizes fairness, the offer is heavily skewed in her favor.  It's important to remember the money is losing value faster for Alice, so a 750,000:250,000 split is likely to be less appealing to her in later rounds.  By rejecting, Bob can take control and potentially negotiate a more equitable split."
