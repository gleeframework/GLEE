"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a significant gain.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **First Offer Advantage:**  In these types of games, the first offer often sets the tone. By proposing a slightly advantageous split for myself, I aim to anchor Bob's expectations.
* **Time is Money:**  Both our potential gains decrease with each round. Offering Bob a decent amount upfront might encourage him to accept rather than risk further devaluation. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** The message aims to portray the offer as fair, potentially making Bob more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice, but let's be realistic. This is a fair offer considering the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is strategically sound from his perspective, but it's unfavorable for me. Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Shift:**  Bob is using the threat of inflation to push for a much larger share. While a 10/20 split difference was somewhat acceptable in Round 1, his current offer significantly favors him.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm willing to risk another round of inflation to try and secure a more balanced outcome.  My offer in the next round will need to account for the devaluation but still aim for a more equitable split. 
* **Calling His Bluff:** Bob's message tries to frame his offer as ""generous."" By rejecting it, I signal that I'm not easily swayed and am willing to negotiate for a better position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money! Let's stop delaying and agree on this mutually beneficial split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm mirroring the proportions of Bob's previous offer but switching the amounts. This maintains a sense of fairness while still tilting the scales slightly in my favor.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the negative impact of inflation for both of us, encouraging Bob to settle now. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** By framing the offer as ""mutually beneficial,"" I'm trying to appeal to Bob's rational side and avoid appearing overly aggressive. 

This offer attempts to find a balance between standing my ground and recognizing the time pressure created by the devaluation mechanism."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to accept this, but here's why I believe it's the most logical choice:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting now secures me a reasonable amount before further devaluation makes it significantly worse.  
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  Bob's message and offer suggest he's unlikely to budge further. He's betting on my aversion to risk and the increasing cost of waiting.
* **Better Than Nothing:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round is incredibly risky. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer, I could end up with even less. 

This is a classic case of choosing the best of unfavorable options.  While I believe my initial offers were fair, Bob played the game effectively, leveraging the inflation mechanism and my desire to avoid further losses."
