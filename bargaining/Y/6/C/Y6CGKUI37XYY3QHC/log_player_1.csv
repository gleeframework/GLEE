"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the wealth!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the initial offer was quite uneven. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a more reasonable split, but I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really biting now! The money is worth even less than before.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my share! The money is worth significantly less than before.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's still a bit uneven, but I'm willing to accept it since it's getting late in the game. I'd rather get something than risk going into another round with even lower values.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
