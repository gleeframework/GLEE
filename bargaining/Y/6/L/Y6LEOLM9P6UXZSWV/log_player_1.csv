"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split in my favor, but I'm trying to be reasonable and give Bob a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get 50 dollars, but due to inflation, its value will be 40 dollars (80% of 50).

I'm not sure if I should accept this compromise. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to meet in the middle yet, let's try to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're willing to meet in the middle, I'll take 60% and give you 40% - it's a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share to account for the inflation, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get 30 dollars, but due to inflation, its value will be 19.2 dollars (80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 0.8 = 19.2).

It's a tough decision, but I think I'll have to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'd rather not accept such a low amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, I'll try to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the remaining rounds.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% and give you 30%, it's my last chance to get a decent share before the inflation eats away at it.""
}
```"
