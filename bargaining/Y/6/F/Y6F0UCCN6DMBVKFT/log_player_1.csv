"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept an even split as I was initially. However, Bob's message seems friendly and conciliatory, so I'm willing to consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
