Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to find a middle ground. Here's my new offer:

}
```

This offer is a bit more balanced, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
