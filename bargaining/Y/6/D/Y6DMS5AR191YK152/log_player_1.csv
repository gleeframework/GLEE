Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $1000 in the first round is now worth $800.

Considering Bob's offer, I get $1000 (which is now worth $800), and Bob gets $9000.

I'll reject this offer.
