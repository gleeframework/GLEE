"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to start, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider this proposal and potentially adjust the split in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 7:3 split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's not in my favor. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 6:4 is a fairer split than 3:7. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
