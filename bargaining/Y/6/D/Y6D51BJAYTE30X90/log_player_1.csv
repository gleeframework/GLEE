"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount. This leaves me with $900,000, which is 90% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair and balanced starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the decreased value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
