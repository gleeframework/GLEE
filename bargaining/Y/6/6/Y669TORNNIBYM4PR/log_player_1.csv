Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but it heavily favors you. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the potential losses we both face from inflation as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. The value of the money is dwindling with each round. My offer of 65/35 is a compromise, reflecting both your initial willingness to offer me a share and the urgency of reaching an agreement. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 6500
