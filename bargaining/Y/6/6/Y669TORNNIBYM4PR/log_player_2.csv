"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split. I'm willing to give you a thousand dollars, but I'll keep the rest.  Think about it, you'll have a chance to propose next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
This is a terrible offer for Bob. While getting $1,000 is better than nothing, the potential gains in future rounds are much higher. Alice is clearly undervaluing Bob's position in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but it heavily favors you. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the potential losses we both face from inflation as the rounds progress.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling more assertive, Bob. But I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me taking a slightly larger share. It's still a significant advantage for you, and we can avoid further inflation losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still significantly undervaluing Bob's position. While a 55/45 split is better, the effects of inflation will escalate quickly. Bob needs to hold out for a better deal to compensate for the decreasing value of the money."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. The value of the money is dwindling with each round. My offer of 65/35 is a compromise, reflecting both your initial willingness to offer me a share and the urgency of reaching an agreement. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. While your previous offer was closer to my preferred split, I'm still willing to give you a slight edge.  I'm offering 4500 for you, 5500 for me.  This avoids further losses and hopefully we can reach an agreement before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but it's time for Bob to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation is Hurting:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth. While not ideal, a 55/45 split in Alice's favor is better than risking even further losses in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge Much:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. It's improbable she'll suddenly agree to a significantly smaller portion, especially with the pressure of inflation.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for an ideal split is risky. If they don't reach an agreement, they both get nothing. 

Bob should secure the current offer and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
