"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the offer is slightly more favorable to me than the previous one, I'll accept it.
