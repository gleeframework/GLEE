"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60 and you get 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. It's still early in the game, and I believe we can find a more favorable division. Let's see what Alice thinks!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, Alice. I think 55-45 is a fair split, considering we both want to walk away with something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we need a middle ground, Bob, but the deal needs to be fair considering the inflation. I'll take 55, you get 45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Given the inflation rates, Alice's gain is worth 19% less than the initial amount, while mine is only 9.75% less. I believe there's still room for a more favorable division, so I'll proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 57-43 split is more reasonable. The value of the money is decreasing faster for you, Alice, so I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the difference.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting us both, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further to 52, leaving you with 48. Let's close this deal before the money is worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Given the increasing inflation rates, it's becoming more crucial to close the deal. Alice's offer of 52-48 seems reasonable, considering the faster decrease in value for her share. I'll take the 48, as it's still a relatively good deal for me, and further rounds might lead to even less valuable gains."
