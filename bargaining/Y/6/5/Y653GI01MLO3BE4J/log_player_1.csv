"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $9,000 and Bob will get $1,000. The message is just a friendly nudge to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than $6,000. The message suggests Bob is being a bit greedy, but I'll give him a chance to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6,000 for me, I'll try to do better. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit too greedy, Bob. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still being generous.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $7,000 and Bob will get $3,000. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken its toll on Bob's offer, and he's now offering me $6,500. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
