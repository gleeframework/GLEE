I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to cooperate."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm lowering my offer to $8,000, while increasing Bob's to $2,000. I'm hoping to show some flexibility and encourage Bob to consider accepting a deal sooner rather than later."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still reject the offer.  Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and I'm willing to risk going another round to see if he will improve his offer. I'm hopeful that he'll realize the value of negotiating a deal soon."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that the longer we wait, the less valuable the money will be for both of us."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, it's still not good enough. I'm still willing to take the risk of rejecting and waiting to see if he'll offer a better deal. The inflation is starting to have a real impact, so I need to make sure I get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm lowering my offer again to $6,000.  The inflation is starting to become very noticeable, and I think Bob will start to feel the pressure to reach an agreement soon."
