"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the value decreases faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the value of the money decreases faster for Alice, I think I can get a better deal if I wait. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the value of money decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Alice each round, I'll try to take advantage of this and offer a slightly better deal for myself. I'll also acknowledge Alice's concern about the value decreasing faster for her.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I see your point, Alice, but I think this is a fairer split considering the decreasing value for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is decreasing slower than the value of the money. Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the value of the money has decreased significantly for both of us, especially for Alice, I think this offer is more reasonable than the previous ones. Considering the decreasing value, I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more value in the next rounds.
