"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a very aggressive start, but I want to see how he reacts.  Knowing that the money depreciates for him at a much faster rate than for me, I believe this will put pressure on him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than my initial offer. However, I'm still in a strong position. The money is worth 20% less to him every round, and I know he'll be feeling the pressure to accept something sooner rather than later. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money.  I believe Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and will be more willing to accept a deal that favors me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round.  While the money is depreciating rapidly for him, he's still holding out.  I need to be strategic and make sure I don't let his desperation lead me to accept a deal that's too unfavorable. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but keeping a significant portion for myself. Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and I think he's starting to understand that he needs to accept something soon. I believe this offer is a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, I need to consider the inflation factor. The money he gains is worth less than 33% of what it was in the first round.  If I keep rejecting, I risk ending up with nothing.  I need to secure some gain, even if it's a small amount. This offer is a gamble, but I believe it's the best strategy to ensure I get something rather than lose everything to inflation."
