"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to take a bit less to ensure we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money will be worth less in future rounds. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slightly larger share this round, but I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement in the next round. Let's see if you're willing to work with me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the ongoing inflation. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get a bigger share, the inflation is definitely hurting me. I'm going to accept this offer to avoid losing more money in the next round."
