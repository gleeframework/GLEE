"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of $2,000 is now worth $1,600 (since it's 20% less than the original $2,000).

I don't think this offer is very generous, considering the initial offer I made was $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob. Now, Bob is offering me $1,600 and taking $8,000. I think I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so my offer will be adjusted accordingly. I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a reasonable one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1200,
  ""bob_gain"": 8800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of the money, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $8,800, which is worth 11% of the original $10,000 (since it's 10% less than the $10,000, but I'm considering the previous round's value of money). I'll take the remaining $1,200."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of money, my gain of $1,000 is now worth approximately $520 (since it's 48.8% less than the original $2,000). Bob's gain of $9,000 is now worth approximately $6,600 (since it's 27.1% less than the original $12,500).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. However, I'm not sure if I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so my offer will be adjusted accordingly. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of Bob's desperation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400,
  ""bob_gain"": 9600,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking control, you're getting a small fraction of the remaining money""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $9,600, which is worth approximately 96% of the remaining value of the original $10,000 (considering the cumulative effect of inflation). I'll take the remaining $400."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm giving up, you take it all 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is throwing in the towel!

Considering the reduced value of money, my gain of $10,000 is now worth approximately $3,230 (since it's 67.23% less than the original $10,000). Bob is offering me the entire amount, and he's giving up.

I'll take the deal. It's not a bad outcome, considering the inflation has eroded the value of the money so much.
