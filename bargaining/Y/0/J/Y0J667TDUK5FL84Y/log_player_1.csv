"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but of course, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness proposal, but with a slight adjustment. Let's try this again. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to match my fairness proposal, but with a slight adjustment. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'm actually getting 50 dollars is equivalent to 60 dollars in the first round, which is a bit less than my original offer. However, Bob's offer is still fair and reasonable.

I'll accept this offer to end the game.
