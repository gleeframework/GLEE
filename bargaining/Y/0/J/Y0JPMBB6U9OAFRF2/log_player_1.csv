"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm going to start with a proposal that benefits me more. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer. While my share is worth less due to inflation, Bob's offer is still extremely lopsided in his favor. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to try and find a more balanced split. Since the money is losing value, I need to be more aggressive. I'm offering 60 for me and 40 for Bob. This is a much fairer division than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. Even with the inflation affecting the money, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll keep pushing for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

The inflation is starting to bite, and it's getting harder to make a profit.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and balanced offer, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept. We're both losing value with each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
