"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $800,000 to me.

I'm not thrilled about the 25% gain I'd get from Bob's offer, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
