Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! I need to think carefully about this one... Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, I'm effectively getting only 64% of the original amount, which is $640,000. Considering Alice is getting $700,000, which is still worth $700,000, I think I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is making it harder to get a good deal. Here's my next offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
