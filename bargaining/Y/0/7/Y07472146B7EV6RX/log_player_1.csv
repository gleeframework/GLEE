"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's also fair in that Bob gets something. I believe this will be a good starting point for negotiation, especially given the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more favorable to him, and while I'm losing a significant portion of the money, the inflation rate is much steeper for him. I believe I can still get a better deal if I reject this offer and make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is still favorable to me, but it compromises more than my first offer. I believe it's a fair compromise given the inflation rates and the fact that Bob is now losing value at a faster rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting Bob much harder now, and while I'm not getting the ideal amount, I'm still getting a significant portion. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
