I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob will likely want to negotiate, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on before inflation starts to hurt my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! While I'm taking a big loss due to inflation, he's getting a much better deal than he should. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate a bit more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 60/40, taking into account the inflation.  While I still want a larger share, I'm hoping to find a compromise that's fair enough to convince Bob to accept.  If we keep going back and forth, inflation is going to hurt both of us, and I'd rather reach a deal sooner than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, Bob's offer is finally getting closer to a more equitable split. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.  I'm not thrilled, but it's the best I can do at this point."
