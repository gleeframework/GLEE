"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

In this round, the money is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. So, my gain of 6000 in the first round is equivalent to 6000 * 0.8 = 4800 in this round.

Bob's offer is 4000 for me, which is 80% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to 4000 * 0.8 = 3200.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
