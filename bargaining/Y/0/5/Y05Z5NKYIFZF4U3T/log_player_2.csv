Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Alice is still trying to take a larger share. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I think I can get a better deal."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, come on! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is getting too risky.  The inflation is eating into the potential gains, and Alice is unlikely to offer me a better deal. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount."
