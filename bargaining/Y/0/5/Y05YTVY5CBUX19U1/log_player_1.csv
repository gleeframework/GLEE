"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with, a fair and simple proposal""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a bit more for myself""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! Given the current situation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 3500 I would get, but I'm also not eager to reject it. I'll think carefully about it...
