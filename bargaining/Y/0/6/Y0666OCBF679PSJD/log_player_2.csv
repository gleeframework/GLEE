"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's be reasonable. I'll take 40%, you take 60%.  We both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are already in Round 3 of 12.  The risk of walking away with nothing increases with each passing round.
* **Fair Offer:**  A 60/40 split in Bob's favor is a good deal, especially considering the inflation working against Alice. 
* **Alice is Likely to Get More Desperate:**  As the inflation continues to hurt Alice's potential gains, she will likely be forced to make even better offers to Bob. However, it's not worth risking getting to that point and potentially getting a worse offer or nothing at all."
