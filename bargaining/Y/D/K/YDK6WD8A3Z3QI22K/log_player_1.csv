Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. It's a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it - any further rounds will only hurt you more. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting longer will only result in a smaller net gain, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's message suggests he is becoming impatient and less likely to make further concessions.  The 50/50 split is his final offer, and rejecting it will likely lead to increasingly unfavorable offers from him. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the game carries a significant risk of getting even less than the current offer, while the potential reward of securing a slightly larger share is diminishing rapidly due to inflation.

In conclusion, while the 50/50 split isn't ideal, accepting it in Round 4 minimizes losses from inflation and secures a reasonable sum, avoiding the risk of walking away with even less."
