"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives us both a good deal.""
}
``` 
 
My reasoning:

* **Understanding the Game:** This is a classic game theory scenario with a ticking clock (inflation). Bob's money loses value faster than mine, putting me at a slight advantage as time goes on.
* **Round 1 Offer:** I want to start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight edge but is still enticing enough for Bob to consider.  A 52.5% / 47.5% split accomplishes this.
* **Message:** Keeping the message simple and positive is key. I don't want to start with aggression or complex negotiation tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This offer is fair and leaves a bit more for me, but it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**My reasoning:**

* **Bob's Advantage:** Bob's offer reflects the inflation dynamic. He's pushing for a larger share, knowing his position improves as time goes on.
* **Unacceptable Terms:**  While Bob calls it ""fair,"" a 45/55 split is significantly in his favor. Accepting now would mean settling for considerably less than my target.
* **Leveraging Time:**  I'm willing to let a few more rounds pass.  The increasing inflation puts pressure on Bob to make a more acceptable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking and the deal is getting worse for you. Let's meet in the middle - this offer is fair and saves us both from further losses.""
}
```

**My Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the inflation and how it works against him. This creates a sense of urgency for him to make a deal.
* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm not accepting his previous offer, I'm moving slightly in his direction. A 51/49 split shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a slight advantage.
* **Framing the Offer:** I'm emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit to make the offer more appealing. I want Bob to see this as a win-win scenario, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get a bigger share to make this worth it for me. This offer is still a good deal for you, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**My Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Tactics:** Bob is trying to use a mix of pressure (mentioning inflation) and seemingly generous language (""flexible,"" ""good deal"") to mask the fact he's still pushing for a heavily skewed split in his favor.
* **Holding Firm:** Accepting 44% of the pot would be a significant loss for me.  While time is a factor, I'm not desperate enough to accept an unfair deal. My position is stronger than he's portraying.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to risk another round or two of rejection. The inflation is working in my favor, and Bob will likely be forced to make a more reasonable offer soon to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time and both lose out. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a decent amount.  Don't let greed make us both losers.""
}
```

**My Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Strategy:**  Bob is proving to be more stubborn than anticipated. To avoid a stalemate, I'm switching to a more direct and firm approach. 
* **The Power of 50/50:**  While I'd prefer a slight advantage, a 50/50 split is objectively fair. This puts the pressure back on Bob, making him justify why he deserves more when time is working against him.
* **Stronger Language:** I'm injecting a sense of urgency and directly calling out Bob's potential greed. This emphasizes the potential for a lose-lose situation if he continues to hold out for an unfair advantage."
