"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 5% less, so I'd get $47.50 (40 / 0.95) if I accept this offer. Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'd get $54 (60 / 0.9).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll accept it.
