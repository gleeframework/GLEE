"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than you offered me, but I need a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 49 dollars is actually worth 49 * 0.95 = 46.55 dollars.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving up the extra dollar. I'll reject the offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my offer needs to take into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bit more for myself to account for the inflation. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, and I'll take 55 dollars. The message is similar to my previous one, but with a slightly more generous offer."
