Alice's offer is still not very appealing. I'm losing money with every round, but I still have time to negotiate a better split. I'll reject this offer and see what she proposes next."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still losing a lot of value due to inflation. Alice's offers are barely increasing, while the amount I'm losing is getting significant.  I'll continue to reject until she offers something that makes more sense for me."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet. The inflation is hitting me hard, but Alice's offers are still not reflecting the real value of the money I'm getting. I'll keep rejecting until she gets serious about giving me a fair share."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm losing a lot, but I'll reject this offer again.  We have a few more rounds, and I'll try to get a better deal."

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a terrible offer, but I'm running out of time and options.  The inflation is taking a huge bite out of my potential earnings, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'll accept this offer, even though it's not ideal."
