"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. I'm willing to give you a chance to be the one to propose next round, but if you reject this offer, you may not get as good a deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 95% of the original value, so I'll be getting 60% of $95, which is $57.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to me than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer to see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 95% of the original value, so I'll be getting a smaller share of the remaining $100.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 45% of the current value of $100, and I'll take the remaining 55%."
