"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this round.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair this time, I'll take the bigger share, but it's your turn to choose next. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, I'll reject it and try to make a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split this time!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a more agreeable solution."
