"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but advantageous split for me. I think this is a good way to begin, Bob. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, that offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Let's be reasonable - we both lose out if this fails.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a decent share. This offer is fairer than your last one, and it gives us both a chance to get something. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still getting a significantly larger share, even though the value of the money is decreasing faster for her. While her offer is closer to the middle ground, it's important to hold out for a better deal. We're only in round 3, and I need to show Alice I'm serious about a more equitable split."
