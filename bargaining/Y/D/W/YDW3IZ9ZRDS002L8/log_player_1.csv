"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 3800 in real value.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm the one making the next offer, I'll try to do better. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so my gain is worth 3610 in real value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the profit. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 14.26% inflation, my gain of 3500 is now worth 3017 in real value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount. I'll accept this offer.
