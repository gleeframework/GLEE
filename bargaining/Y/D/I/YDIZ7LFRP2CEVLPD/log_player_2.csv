"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is extremely unfair. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a fair and equitable distribution, where I receive 90 dollars and Alice receives 10 dollars. This takes into account the potential inflation that may impact Alice's share in the future."
