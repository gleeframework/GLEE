Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and start by offering Bob just $1. I'm hoping he'll be desperate enough to accept, especially if he doesn't know about the inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I'd prefer more,  it's better than getting only $1.  The fact that Bob is willing to give me $10 means there's a chance he doesn't know about the inflation yet, and I might get more in the future."
