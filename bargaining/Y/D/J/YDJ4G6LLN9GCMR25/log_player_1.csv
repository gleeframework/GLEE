"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation that's coming!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is not as generous as my initial one, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting! Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, considering the inflation. Since Bob's offer was 70, I'll try to get closer to 50, but not quite there. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money Bob gains being worth only 32.77% of what it was in the first round, this offer is extremely skewed in his favor. I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, considering the extreme inflation. Since Bob's offer was 85, I'll try to get as close to 50 as possible, but I'll also consider the fact that the money is worth less and less for Bob with each round. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
