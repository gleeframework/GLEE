"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 80-20 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly message to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to take that into account.

However, Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.
