"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems reasonable now, the inflation will quickly erode my potential gains in later rounds. I need to aim for a much better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, Alice. How about this offer? It accounts for the time pressure and gives us both a chance to benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is still better for you than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is even worse than before, considering the inflation. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the deadline. I'm offering a deal that ensures I get compensated fairly for the inflation, leaving you with a reasonable sum. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a compromise. This deal gives me a slight edge while still leaving you with a decent share considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still fixated on that slight advantage, even though the value of the deal significantly decreases for me with each round. This offer is barely better than her previous one after accounting for inflation. I need to make it clear that I'm serious about getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a significant amount still, but I need to be compensated for the time pressure. Take this deal, or I'm going for an even bigger share in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on any longer. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally acknowledging the equal split, and with only 5 rounds left, the inflation will severely impact any potential gains from holding out further. A 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this stage."
