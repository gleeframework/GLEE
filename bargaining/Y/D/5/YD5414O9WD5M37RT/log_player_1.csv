"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```
I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42.15 
# Bob gain: 57.85 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
