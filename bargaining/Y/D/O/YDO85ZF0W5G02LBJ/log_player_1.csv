"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's split it 40-60, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and Bob gets 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 40, I'll give you a bit more. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $30, which is less than my original proposal of $40.

However, I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
