"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll compare the value of the offers.

In the first round, my gain of 60 was worth 60, and Bob's gain of 40 was worth 40.
In the second round, my gain of 70 is worth 60 (since it's the same as in the first round), and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 24 (80% of 30).

I'll accept this offer.
