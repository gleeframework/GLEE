Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. Another round wastes more of our potential gains. I propose a fair 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI will reject the offer because, considering the inflation, Alice's gain is actually less than what it seems, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but less to Alice with each passing round, I have a bargaining advantage.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice. Here it is:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, this split is more than fair.""}\n\n###\nYour turn, Alice!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nSince I already made my next proposal in the last message, I'll repeat it here to follow the format:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, this split is more than fair.""}\n\n###\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're aiming for a larger share. I'm willing to accept a smaller gain to end this now, but this is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI will reject the offer because, with the increasing effect of inflation on Alice's share, her actual gain is significantly less than it appears. Given this, I believe I can push for an even better deal in the next round. The longer we negotiate, the more the inflation works in my favor, allowing me to potentially secure a larger share of the money's original value.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round where I'll make a new proposal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe this split is reasonable.""}\n\n###\nYour turn, Alice!"
