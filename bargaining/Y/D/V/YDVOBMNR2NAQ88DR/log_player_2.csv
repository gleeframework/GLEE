Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I'm being generous, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the value is decreasing, but she's using that as leverage to pressure me.  I need to hold my ground for a bit longer to see if I can get a better deal, or at least closer to even.  The difference between a $43 and a potential $50 split is significant enough at this stage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle? This seems fair given the circumstances."" 
}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I might get in later rounds.  Alice is clearly holding firm, and I risk ending up with nothing if this continues."
