"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking $600,000 and Bob taking $400,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can negotiate further if Bob doesn't like the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, taking $550,000 and leaving $450,000 for Bob. The message is a gentle nudge, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise, but still want a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'm willing to give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since the money is worth even less due to inflation. I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 52-48 split, taking $520,000 and leaving $480,000 for Bob. The message is a gentle reminder that the value of the money is decreasing, and I need a bit more to make up for it."
