"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share of the money, knowing that the value will depreciate more for Bob with each round.  I'm hoping he'll take this deal to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I'm still losing value faster than Bob. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent portion.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and avoiding further rounds of depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse for me, even though Bob is taking a bigger share.  I'm determined to get a better deal than this, so I'm rejecting and hoping for a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly again.  While my share is decreasing due to inflation, I'm trying to stay ahead of Bob's inflation rate.  I'm hoping this will be a tempting enough offer for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly unfavorable for me. While I'm losing value rapidly, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  We're both losing value quickly, and I think this is the most fair way to divide the remaining money.  It's a gamble, but I believe it's the best chance we have of getting something."
