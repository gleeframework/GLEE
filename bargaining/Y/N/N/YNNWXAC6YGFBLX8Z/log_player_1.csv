Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a generous offer from me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, I believe I can get a better deal if I play strategically and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than my initial offer, but I'm still giving him a decent portion. With the inflation factor kicking in, I need to be more strategic about my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what I could get if the game continues and I reach the 12th round with no deal, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to continue to play strategically and reject his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share again, but still a fair amount.  The inflation is making it riskier to wait, but I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, and my potential gains are dropping rapidly.  Even though Bob's offer is less than what I initially wanted, it's still a decent amount, and the risk of getting nothing at the end is too high.  I'll accept this offer."
