"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll take a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of money. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my previous one."
