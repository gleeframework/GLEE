"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
This is a classic ultimatum game with the added twist of inflation. While 60/40 seems like a decent starting point, waiting Alice out in the early rounds could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""How about we go 55-45? It's closer to an even split and we both walk away with a good amount before inflation eats away at it.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can go a bit lower, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging, and we're already losing a significant chunk to inflation. Holding out a little longer might make her realize time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with every round.  I'm offering you a deal where you still get a great sum - let's be smart about this before inflation takes its toll.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get the larger share. Inflation is hurting us both, let's settle this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, and acknowledging the impact of inflation.  However, she's still trying to hold on to a significantly larger share. We're getting closer to the halfway point of the rounds, so the pressure is on for her to make a more appealing offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 510000,
