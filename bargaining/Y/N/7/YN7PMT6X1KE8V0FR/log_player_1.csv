"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you $200,000. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a fair starting point, and leaves Bob with $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm offering you a good share. Accept this and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $400,000.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, considering I'm losing $400,000 in value compared to the initial offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm not giving up that much. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a slightly better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it 50/50, let's call it a day!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and I'm not giving up as much value as I was in Bob's previous offer."
