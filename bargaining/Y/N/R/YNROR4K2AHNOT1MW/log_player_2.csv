"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, considering I'm facing inflation.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is diminishing rapidly for me. I need a better offer than that to accept. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll make another counteroffer in the next round. The inflation is indeed affecting Alice, but the offer still seems too skewed in her favor."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure of inflation, but I've already compromised. This is as fair as it gets considering the circumstances.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking, and every round costs me significantly. Accept this offer, and let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gains, I believe she is under increasing pressure to reach an agreement. Her offer still seems too favorable to her, despite the circumstances. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer, hoping to find a more balanced division."

Round 6

This is a compromise considering the initial offer and the current circumstances.""}"
