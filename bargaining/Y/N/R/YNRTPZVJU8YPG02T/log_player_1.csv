Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll get $900,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a more fair split, considering the inflation factor. Let's work together and finish this game. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, Bob's offer is more reasonable. I'll consider it.
