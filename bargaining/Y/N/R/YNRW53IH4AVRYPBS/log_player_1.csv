"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good starting offer. Accept and we can end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a fair share, and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm taking a bit more this time, but we'll split it more evenly if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

After considering the proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the inflation, and I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
