"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\nI offered 60% of the money to myself and 40% to Bob, considering that with each passing round, the money loses value more quickly for me than for Bob. This division seems fair given the conditions. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a more balanced split, considering both our inflation rates.  This offer is a good starting point for a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because accepting 40% of the money in the second round means I'll actually get less value than if I had accepted a similar percentage in the first round, due to the higher inflation rate affecting my share. I believe there's room for a more favorable division in the next rounds, considering the impact of inflation on both our shares. Let's proceed and see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, this is a more balanced offer. I'm willing to compromise but also need to account for the higher devaluation of my share.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a division that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still takes into account the higher inflation rate affecting my share. By proposing 55% for myself and 45% for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but particularly for me. This adjustment shows my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable agreement."
