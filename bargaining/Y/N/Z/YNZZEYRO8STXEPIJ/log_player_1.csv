Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, knowing Bob's money will depreciate more quickly than mine.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge improvement over my first offer, but I'm not going to accept it yet. The money is depreciating faster for Bob than for me, so I'm going to try to push for an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money.  I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much more favorable than my last offer.  While I would have liked more, I'm aware that each round makes his money worth less.  I'm going to accept this offer before the money depreciates further."
