"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer is designed to test the waters.  I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he might accept it in the first round.  If he doesn't, I'll have more information about how he's likely to behave in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much better for Bob than my previous offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can do better. I'll reject this and see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Bob seems to be quite greedy, so I'm going to keep testing him to see how far he's willing to go."
