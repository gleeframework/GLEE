Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

I'm offering a slightly higher share to myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"

```"

```
This one should be a bit more generous to Bob than my previous offer, but still leaves me with a decent share. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
