Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, 52.5/47.5 is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's settle this

# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. While I'd prefer a slightly higher split, it's better to take what I can get than risk losing everything.  Let's close this deal."
