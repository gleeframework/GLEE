Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the $1000, even though it's less than I wanted. Inflation is making the money less valuable, so I don't want to risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
