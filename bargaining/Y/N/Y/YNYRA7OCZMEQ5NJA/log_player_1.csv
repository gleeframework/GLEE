Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can do better than that. How about I get $52 and you get $48? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for me with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Bob's Conceding (Slightly):** Bob has reduced his demand slightly from $55 to $52. This suggests he's somewhat willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might propose an even worse deal in the next round, leaving me with even less. 

It's better to secure a less-than-ideal deal now than risk losing more value through inflation and potentially ending up with an even worse offer later."
