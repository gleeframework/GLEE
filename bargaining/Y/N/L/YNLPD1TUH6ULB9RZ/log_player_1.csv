"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases by 20% for Bob with each passing round but remains unchanged for me, starting with a higher offer that still leans in my favor seems strategic. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to psychologically frame this division as a reasonable compromise, despite it favoring me, in hopes that Bob might accept early on to avoid further devaluation of his potential share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Given that the value of money remains the same for me across rounds but decreases by 20% for Bob, I have a strategic advantage in waiting. The current offer from Bob gives him 60% and me 40%, which is less favorable than my initial offer to him. Since we are only in Round 2 and there are 10 more rounds to go, I can afford to wait for a potentially better offer as Bob's share devalues over time. Additionally, accepting an offer that gives Bob more than me doesn't align with my initial strategy of leveraging the game's rules to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering your counter, I'll adjust slightly""}\n\nIn this round, I'll slightly adjust my offer to give Bob a bit more, but still maintain a significant advantage for myself. Given the devaluation of Bob's share over time, I'm under no pressure to make drastic concessions. The message aims to convey a sense of compromise and flexibility, while still pushing for a favorable outcome. By making minor adjustments, I'm also testing Bob's willingness to settle as the rounds progress and his potential share continues to decrease in value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. While this might seem like a fair division under normal circumstances, the rules of the game give me a significant advantage due to the devaluation of Bob's share over time. Since we are only in Round 4 and there are 8 more rounds to go, I can afford to wait for Bob to become more desperate as the value of his potential share continues to decrease. Accepting a 50/50 split now would mean I'm not fully leveraging the strategic advantage provided by the game's rules. By rejecting this offer, I'm applying pressure on Bob, anticipating that he will be more willing to accept less favorable terms in future rounds to avoid further devaluation of his share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Moving closer, but still considering the future value""}\n\nIn this round, I'll again slightly adjust my offer to Bob, increasing his share minimally while maintaining a favorable position for myself. Given the ongoing devaluation of Bob's potential share (now worth 48.8% less than in the first round), I'm in a strong negotiating position. The message aims to hint at my awareness of the game's progression and its impact on the value of the money, suggesting that I'm making concessions while also being mindful of the strategic landscape. By inching closer to a 50/50 split but not quite reaching it, I'm testing Bob's patience and willingness to settle as the rounds continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a better share than before. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's attempt to frame this as finding a middle ground, the offer still gives him a larger share than me, which is unfavorable considering the game's rules. Given that we are now in Round 6 and Bob's share continues to devalue significantly (now worth 67.23% less than initially), I believe he will become increasingly desperate to reach an agreement. The fact that Bob is willing to compromise suggests he is beginning to feel the pressure of the game's progression. By rejecting this offer, I aim to push Bob further, anticipating that he will be willing to accept a less favorable division in future rounds as the value of his potential share continues to plummet. My goal remains to maximize my gain, leveraging the strategic advantage provided by the game's rules."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value, this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\nIn this round, I'll make another slight adjustment to my offer, increasing Bob's share marginally. Given the significant devaluation of Bob's potential share (now worth 67.23% less than initially), I'm in a strong position to dictate terms. However, I'm also mindful of the need to appear reasonable and willing to compromise to avoid pushing Bob into holding out for too long. The message aims to frame this offer as a concession, taking into account the decreasing value of Bob's share, while still maintaining a favorable division for myself. By continuing to inch closer to a more even split but not quite reaching it, I'm applying gentle pressure on Bob, encouraging him to accept a deal that is increasingly in my favor as the rounds progress."
