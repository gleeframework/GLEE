The twist is that the money loses 20% of its value with each round due to inflation, pressuring players to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\nYour strategy started with a 60-40 split in your favor, considering the psychological aspect of negotiation where starting higher gives room for compromise. As the game progressed and inflation reduced the total amount, you adjusted your offers to maintain a higher percentage, eventually settling at a 75-25 split. This demonstrates an understanding of the impact of inflation on the game's dynamics and the importance of reaching a deal before the value decreases further.\n\nBob's decision to accept in the fourth round likely came from realizing that further rounds would significantly reduce the total amount, making the 75-25 split more favorable compared to potential future offers.\n\nThis negotiation game highlights the importance of considering external factors (like inflation) in strategic decision-making and the balance between holding out for a better deal and the risk of losing value over time."
