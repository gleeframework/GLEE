"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the remaining 200,000 between us in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000$, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can negotiate further in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't want to split it evenly just yet. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best idea. I'll make a new offer in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```"
