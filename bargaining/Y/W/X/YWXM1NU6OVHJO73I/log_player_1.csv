I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, an even split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, as I was hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a 3:2 split, it's a good middle ground""}

I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a 3:2 split, where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair middle ground, considering we're both trying to get a good deal."
