"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This way, I secure a significant portion of the money, and Bob still gets a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose that I receive $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000. While I'm willing to compromise, I still believe a larger portion of the money should go to me, considering I'm the one making the offer this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, I've already rejected two of Bob's offers.  The inflation is making the money worth significantly less, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure at least some of the money."
