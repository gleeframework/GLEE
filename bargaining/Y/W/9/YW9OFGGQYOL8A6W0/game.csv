9000.0,1000.0,"Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you can have the rest.  Think about it, if we go to the next round you'll get less because of the inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Your turn Alice. How about we try something a little more equitable this time?  I'll take a little more since the value decreases for me each round, but this offer is still fair to you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Ok, I understand the inflation affects you more. Let's try 60/40 this time.  This is a good deal for both of us considering how the money will decrease in value with each round. ",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're getting close, but your offers are heavily favoring you.  Let's try something closer to the middle. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle.  I'll take a bit less than my previous offer to try and reach an agreement.  We are both losing money with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us!",Alice,5,
