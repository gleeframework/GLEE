350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, that wasn't a fair start.  Let's be realistic. This is a good offer for you considering the inflation, let's close the deal and both come out winners.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but we need to be closer to a 50/50 split.  I'm not going to get any more money than you due to inflation, so the next offer needs to be fairer.",Alice,3,

375000.0,625000.0,"Alice, this is a fair compromise that accounts for the inflation. You're still getting a significant sum, and it's better than waiting for the value to decrease further. Let's settle this now.",Bob,4,

450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to let you take more than half.  We need to find a solution that's closer to a 50/50 split, or we'll both lose more money due to inflation.",Alice,5,

425000.0,575000.0,"Alice, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. This offer reflects that I'm willing to move closer to a 50/50 split, but I also need to consider that the value decreases for you, not me. Time is running out, let's make a deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  It's time for us to split this 50/50 and avoid losing any more money to inflation.  Let's be reasonable and finish this now.",Alice,7,
