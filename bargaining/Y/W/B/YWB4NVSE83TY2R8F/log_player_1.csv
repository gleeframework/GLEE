Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!  I'm hoping to get as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I think I can do better than a 40/60 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split this time. I think Bob will see that this is a fair deal, especially since inflation is working in my favor."
