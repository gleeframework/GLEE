"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'd like to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm offering to take 42% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money I'll gain, I think I should be more aggressive in my negotiation. However, I'll still think carefully about Bob's offer. After considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'd like to accept this offer.
