Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which means my position is getting stronger. While the deal is getting ""better"" for me in nominal terms, I need to push my advantage while she's more afraid of losing everything."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially considering the time pressure. Let's end this now and avoid losing any more money to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to maximize my gain while accounting for Alice's likely behavior and the shrinking pot. Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share, but the increasing inflation rate puts pressure on her to settle. 

Offering a 50/50 split does a few things:

* **Projects strength:**  It shows I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair deal. 
* **Capitalizes on Alice's fear:** The ""final offer"" language increases pressure as she's likely getting desperate.
* **Offers a ""fair"" out:**  A 50/50 split is logically justifiable, making it more palatable for Alice to accept without feeling like she ""lost.""

If Alice rejects this, it's likely she won't agree to anything reasonable in the remaining rounds."
