Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's meet in the middle. Time is precious, and this offer still ensures a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

This is my final offer before I need to prioritize my own gains due to the shrinking pot.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something substantial before inflation eats away at it further. This is my final offer above 50%. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough call, but with the rapidly increasing inflation for both of us (especially Alice), it makes sense to take a reasonable offer while it's still on the table.  Waiting any longer is likely to result in even worse offers from Alice, as she's stated this is her final offer above 50%."
