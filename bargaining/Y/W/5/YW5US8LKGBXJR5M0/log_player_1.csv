"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 95/5 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared for him to reject and propose a different split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best choice given the inflation. My share is significantly reduced due to inflation, and while Bob's share is reduced even more, his offer is still more favorable than the outcome if I reject and we move to round 3."
