"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is actually worth 80% of the original $8,000, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 90% of the original $4,400.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll accept it for now.
