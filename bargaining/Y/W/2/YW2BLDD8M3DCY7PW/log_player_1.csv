Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 3:1 is too generous. I'd like to propose a 2:1 ratio to balance out the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
