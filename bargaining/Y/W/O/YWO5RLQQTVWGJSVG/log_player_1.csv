Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars and leave 400,000 dollars for Bob."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of our potential earnings.
