"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n### \n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and take $6000 for myself, with a message saying ""Let's be fair"". This is the first round, so the total amount is still $10,000. I'm trying to start with a relatively even split, but slightly in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more balanced way to start this game. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the split is relatively close, I think I can get a better deal, especially since I started with a more generous offer in the first round. The inflation also makes me more cautious, as the value of the money is decreasing. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and take $5800 for myself, with a message saying ""Meet me in the middle"". Since Bob's previous offer was a 55/45 split, I'm trying to find a compromise by moving closer to the middle while still keeping a slight advantage. Let's see how Bob responds!"
