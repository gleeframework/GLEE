"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth 20% less, so I'd actually be getting 48$ (60% of 80$). I think this is a reasonable offer, and I'd rather accept it than risk going to the next round and facing further inflation.
