"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm still the one who's doing most of the work 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $180,000 (90% of $200,000)
* Bob's gain: $800,000 (10% of $800,000)

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'm getting significantly less than I proposed in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

* Bob's gain: $546,000 (30% of $1,800,000, which is 180% of the original $1,000,000)
