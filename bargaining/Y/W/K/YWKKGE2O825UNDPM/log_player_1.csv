Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is $200,000. I'm taking the remaining 80%."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 800,000, I'll offer him a slightly higher amount to make it more attractive.
