"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 80/20 in my favor. It's a fair deal given the potential of inflation. We can both still get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
