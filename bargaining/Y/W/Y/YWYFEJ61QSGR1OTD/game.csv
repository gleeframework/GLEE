60.0,40.0,Let's start with a fair offer. I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  This benefits us both as we avoid the money devaluating.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can find a better balance. Since the money devalues less for me, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the risk of further rounds. Let's try 55-45 and save our money from inflation!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the faster rate of inflation for me. Let's be reasonable: I'll take a slight reduction to $58, leaving you with $42. This way, we both benefit significantly compared to further rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Considering the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I'm willing to adjust my proposal. A 52-48 split seems more reasonable, as it acknowledges the devaluation risk for both of us. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast.  My previous offer was already a compromise. I'm willing to adjust slightly further to $56 for me and $44 for you. This is my final offer; let's agree now and walk away with something substantial.",Alice,5,
