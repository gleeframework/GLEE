I propose to take $900,000 and give $100,000 to Bob. This is a very generous offer considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much worse deal than the first round. Even though I'm getting $100,000 less because of inflation, it's still much more than the $100,000 Bob is offering. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob.  While inflation has decreased the value of my share, I'm still willing to give Bob a significant amount. I'm confident that this will be a more appealing offer than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is significantly worse than the previous round. Even with inflation, getting $200,000 is still a huge loss compared to the $800,000 I'm being offered. I'm not going to accept this. I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob.  This is a fair offer given the impact of inflation on my share of the money. Hopefully Bob will recognize that this is a better deal than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still significantly less than the $700,000 I was offering in the previous round.  Despite inflation, I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'm going to try and secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. This is still a generous offer, especially considering how much inflation has impacted my share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this is a fair deal and accept it."
