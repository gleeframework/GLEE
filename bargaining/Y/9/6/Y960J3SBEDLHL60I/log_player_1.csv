"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gained in the first round still worth the same, and Bob's offer being 10% less than what he would have gained in the first round, I think I'm getting a good deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
