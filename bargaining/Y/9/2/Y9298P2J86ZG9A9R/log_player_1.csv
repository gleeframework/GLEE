I'm going to start with a very simple offer, giving myself the lion's share.  This is a classic strategy in negotiation to see if the other player is willing to accept a lopsided deal.  I'm also curious to see how Bob reacts to the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob has flipped the script on me! I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's tempting to get something rather than nothing, I'm playing the long game.  I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise or if he's going to continue to be greedy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced split this time. Since Bob was willing to take a significant majority in the last round, I'm hoping this more equitable offer will encourage him to accept and end the game."
