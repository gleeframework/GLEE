Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I get 900,000 and Bob gets 100,000.  This seems fair considering I'm taking on the risk of losing money if we keep going. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept the offer. While I'm getting less than I originally proposed, the inflation would make any further rounds even worse for me.  It's better to take what I can get now."
