Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I've moved closer to your offer, let's close this out before we both lose. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about the time pressure, his offer is still significantly better for him in real terms. The longer we wait, the more the inflation hurts me. However, accepting a bad deal just to avoid getting zero is not the optimal strategy. By continuing to reject and proposing slightly better offers for myself, I'm hoping Bob will feel the pressure and accept before it's too late."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle. This is a fair deal, and we need to close it out now before the inflation eats up more of our potential gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I am conceding to Bob's previous offer. It's still not ideal due to the inflation, but waiting longer is too risky. I need to signal I'm willing to compromise and hope Bob accepts now before the deal gets worse for both of us."
