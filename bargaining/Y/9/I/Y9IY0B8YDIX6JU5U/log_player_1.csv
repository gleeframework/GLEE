"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think I'm getting a fair deal with this offer. Bob is offering me only $200,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial $500,000. I'm not willing to accept this offer, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a new proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's try again""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, where I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000. I'm trying to be more flexible and willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm still the one who deserves the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely disappointed with this offer. The money I'm being offered is worth significantly less than the initial amount, and the 1% I'm being offered is an insult. I'm not willing to accept such a paltry sum, especially when Bob is getting the majority of the money. I'd like to make another proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a sacrifice for a deal, let's try again""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, where I get $300,000 and Bob gets $700,000. I'm trying to be more flexible and willing to make a sacrifice to reach a deal. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a more reasonable offer and be willing to compromise."
