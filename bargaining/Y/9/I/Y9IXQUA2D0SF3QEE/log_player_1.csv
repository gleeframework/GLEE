"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial amount, which is a relatively generous offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'd like to accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like Bob is making a reasonable adjustment for the inflation, and I'm willing to accept his offer."
