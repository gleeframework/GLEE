"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I would only get $3,000 and Bob would get $7,000. I think I can do better than that! I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I'm trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer, hoping that this one will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'm already feeling the pinch. Getting only $2,000 while Bob gets $8,000 is an unacceptable deal. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get $3,500 and Bob gets $6,500. I'm trying to be more conciliatory and give Bob a slightly better deal, hoping that he'll finally accept an offer."
