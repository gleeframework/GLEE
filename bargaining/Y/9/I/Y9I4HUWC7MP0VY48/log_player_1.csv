"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we can consider this a fairly standard split. I'll attach the message ""Let's split fairly"" to convey my intention of being reasonable and open to negotiation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair at first glance, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased. Given that I'm aiming for a higher gain and the fact that we have multiple rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\nGiven the inflation rates, I'll adjust my offer slightly. I'll propose that I receive $5800 and Bob receive $4200. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" aims to acknowledge the impact of inflation on our negotiations and shows willingness to adapt, while still maintaining a favorable split for myself. Your turn!"

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current inflation rates, the actual value of the money has decreased significantly. Even though Bob is offering a slight compromise, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of this and aim for a more favorable split in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Inflation hits you harder, let's be realistic""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's gain, I'll make a bolder offer. I'll propose that I receive $6200 and Bob receive $3800. The message ""Inflation hits you harder, let's be realistic"" acknowledges the uneven effect of inflation on our gains and encourages Bob to accept a less favorable split, given the circumstances.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's message emphasizes the need for compromise, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. With the inflation rates affecting Bob's gain more significantly, I'm willing to take a risk and reject this offer.

I'll propose that I receive $6800 and Bob receive $3200. The message ""Last chance for a reasonable split"" emphasizes the urgency of the situation and encourages Bob to accept this offer, as it's likely the best deal he'll get at this point.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're down to the wire! I'm willing to take the majority of the remaining value, but it's better to get something than nothing at this point. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the extreme impact of inflation on both our gains, I believe it's better to accept this offer rather than risking getting nothing. Although the split is not ideal, the significantly decreased value of the money means that further negotiations are unlikely to yield a substantially better outcome. I'll accept this offer to ensure I receive some value, rather than risking a zero outcome if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
