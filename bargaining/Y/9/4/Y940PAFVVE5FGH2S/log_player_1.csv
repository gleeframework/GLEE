Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
