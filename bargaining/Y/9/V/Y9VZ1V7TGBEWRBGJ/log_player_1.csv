"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly lower share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so the actual value of my gain is $4750 (5000 x 0.95).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up a significant amount to Bob, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
