"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 1% and let's negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to start, hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm not going to get greedy. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
