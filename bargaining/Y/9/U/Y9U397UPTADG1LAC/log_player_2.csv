"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unequal split, and while 100,000$ is a good amount of money, I'm going to try to get more. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose an even split. I think this is the fairest way to divide the money, and it gives us both a good amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still being very greedy. Even though my potential gains are reduced due to inflation, I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to try and get Alice to accept. I'm still holding out for a better deal, but this is a reasonable offer."
