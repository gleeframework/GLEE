Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, acknowledging that a 50/50 split isn't fair in the long run due to inflation. This offer still gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
