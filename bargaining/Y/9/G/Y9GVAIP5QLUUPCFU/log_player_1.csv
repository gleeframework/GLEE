"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I like the idea of meeting in the middle, and a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise."
