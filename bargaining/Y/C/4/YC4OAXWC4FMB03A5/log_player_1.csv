"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation is hitting hard, and if I reject, I'm not guaranteed a better offer in the next round.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
