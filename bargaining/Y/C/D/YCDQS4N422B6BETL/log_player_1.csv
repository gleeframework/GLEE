This offer gives me a large share, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I believe this offer is more appealing to Bob than the previous round's offer, considering the inflation impact on his gain."
