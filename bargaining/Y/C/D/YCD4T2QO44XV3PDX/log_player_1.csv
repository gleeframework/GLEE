"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no advantage for either of us, but at least we'll both get something 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
