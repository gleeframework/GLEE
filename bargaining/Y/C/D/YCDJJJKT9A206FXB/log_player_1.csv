"Bob rejected your offer from round 97.

Round 98
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 99.31% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

It's the final round, and while I know this is the most likely outcome, I'm going to stick with my strategy and reject Bob's offer.  I've tried to be fair and reach a compromise throughout this game, but Bob has been relentless in his pursuit of taking the whole amount.  I'm not giving up now. I've shown resilience and determination throughout this difficult negotiation, and I want to see it through to the very end.  I'm not going to let him get away with taking everything without a fight."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 98.
Round 99
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

It's the final round, and while I know Bob is likely to take the whole amount, I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. I've tried to be fair and reach a compromise throughout this game, and even though I'm likely to get nothing, I want to end it by offering a truly fair deal.  We've both been through a lot in this game, and I hope that at the very least, Bob might recognize the value in ending it with a bit of mutual respect."
