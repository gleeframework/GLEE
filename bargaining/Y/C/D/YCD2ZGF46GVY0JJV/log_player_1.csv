Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair deal given the inflation we've both endured. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although the inflation has significantly impacted Bob's offer, accepting it in Round 4 is the best option.  Continuing to reject offers could lead to even lower returns in the future, making this a strategically sound decision."
