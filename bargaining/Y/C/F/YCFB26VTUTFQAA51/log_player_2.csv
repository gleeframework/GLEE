Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, Alice seems to be playing a game of chicken.  I need to show some resolve. Accepting a continually decreasing offer will only result in a worse deal in the later rounds if she continues to decline. There's still time to negotiate a better split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you're tough!  Let's end this. A perfectly even split.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'even split' was a good try, but I know the money's worth less to you now 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting very risky now. Alice is clearly aware of the impact inflation is having on my potential gains. If I continue to reject her offers, I risk walking away with nothing. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees something rather than risking a complete loss if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
