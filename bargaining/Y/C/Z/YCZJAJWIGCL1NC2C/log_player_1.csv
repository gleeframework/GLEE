I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave 100,000 dollars for Bob. I believe this is a fair offer, as it is in my best interest to secure as much money as possible, while still giving Bob a small incentive to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 
I'm offering 800,000 to myself and 200,000 to Bob. Given the inflation, this is a good deal for both of us. This is a big increase for Bob compared to his last offer, and I still get a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 to myself and 300,000 to Bob.  This is a fair compromise, given the increasing inflation, and it gives Bob a significant increase over his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though this is a 50/50 split, it's the best I can hope for given the inflation.  Bob is getting a very good deal, but I'm getting something at least, and the inflation will only get worse from here."
