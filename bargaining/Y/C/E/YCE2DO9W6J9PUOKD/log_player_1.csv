"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward 50/50 split to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money, but 2000 is a decent amount. I'll accept the offer.
