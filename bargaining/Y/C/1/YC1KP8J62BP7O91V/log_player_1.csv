"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the original $100, and keeping $70 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer,  as we both get a decent amount.  Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my $70 from the first round is now worth $63.

I'm not too keen on Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a bit more considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my $63 from the previous round is now worth $56.40 (since it's 10% less again).

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we're both getting less with each round!""
}
```"
