"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation you'll be facing next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'm now thinking more conservatively. Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original proposal, considering the inflation.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
