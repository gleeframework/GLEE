"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the high stakes and the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the new values are:

Alice gain: $600,000 (worth $480,000 in round 1)
Bob gain: $400,000 (worth $320,000 in round 1)

Considering the reduced value, I'll reject this offer as well.
