"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair and reasonable offer, considering that the money is worth more to me in each subsequent round. I'm also trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's perception of the money's value decreases by 10% each round, so I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a lower offer early on. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly. Let's start with that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me 20 dollars less than my initial proposal, I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, hoping to get a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll try to come up with a more convincing proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob's offer in the previous round was to split the money evenly, but with him getting 60 dollars, I'll try to meet him in the middle, but still taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth more to me. I'll offer him 45 dollars, which is 5 dollars more than my initial offer, but still less than the 60 dollars he wanted.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's compromise and meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI hope this offer is more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money to him. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money is decreasing for me with each round.  Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is still worth the same to me, but Bob's offer gives me 10 dollars less than my previous proposal, I might be tempted to reject this offer. However, considering that Bob is trying to negotiate and is taking into account the decreasing value of the money to him, I think this offer is relatively fair. Additionally, if I reject this offer, the game will continue, and Bob's perception of the money's value will continue to decrease, which might lead to even lower offers in the future. So, I'll accept this offer and end the game here.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game here! I think this is a fair deal, considering the circumstances."
