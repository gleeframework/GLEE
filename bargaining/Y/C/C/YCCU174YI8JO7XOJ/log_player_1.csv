"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point for our negotiations. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly way to initiate the conversation and encourage Bob to consider my proposal.\n###\n###\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision and any message he'd like to send back."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but I'm willing to give you a bit more to get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I was initially hoping for a larger share. Given that the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I'm willing to take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n###\n###\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision and Bob's next move.\n###\n###\nAlso, I'll make sure to take into account the decreasing value of money for both of us in my next proposal.\n###\n###\nLet's proceed to Round 3!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle considering inflation""}\n\n###\nGiven that the money is worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept my proposal.\n###\n###\nPlease let me know Bob's decision and any message he'd like to send back.\n###\n###\nI'm looking forward to hearing his thoughts!"
