"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and you get the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my potential gain in the next round.

However, I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $5,000 and consider it a fair split, given the circumstances."
