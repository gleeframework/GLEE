300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This reflects the time pressure we both face, and frankly, your initial offer was laughable.  Take this deal now, or the next one will be even less appealing.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but your offer is still too far off.  I'm willing to compromise further, proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it's also a fair reflection of the value we both bring to this agreement. Let's settle this before further inflation erodes our gains.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking, and frankly, your stalling tactics are tiresome. I'm offering you 400,000 - a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the fact that your potential gains are diminishing faster than mine. Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
