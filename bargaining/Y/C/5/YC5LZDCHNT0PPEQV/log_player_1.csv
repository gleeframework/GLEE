"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 400,000 and take 600,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

I'll think carefully... With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, this offer is actually a 50/50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.
