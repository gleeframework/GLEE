Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, aiming to secure a deal quickly. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I would have preferred a more even split, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  The inflation makes any further negotiation risky, and I'm likely to get a worse deal in the next round."
