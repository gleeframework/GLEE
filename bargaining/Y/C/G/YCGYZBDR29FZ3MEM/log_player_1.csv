"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a better split, but I'll give you a decent chunk too! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to adjust my decision. Since the money is worth 20% less, $3,000 is actually equivalent to $4,000 in the original amount, which is a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
