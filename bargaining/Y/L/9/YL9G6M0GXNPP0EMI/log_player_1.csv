Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will be so eager to get anything at all that he'll accept this.  If not, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, this is a significant improvement over the previous round.  The 5% inflation means that I'm getting less than I would have in the first round, but it's still a much larger share than Bob's offer. It's best to take what I can get."
