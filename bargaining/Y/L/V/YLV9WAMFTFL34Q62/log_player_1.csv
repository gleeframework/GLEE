"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's avoid any further negotiation and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $6000 * 0.95 = $5700.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round (95% of 95% = 90.25%). I'll take that into account when making my next offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
