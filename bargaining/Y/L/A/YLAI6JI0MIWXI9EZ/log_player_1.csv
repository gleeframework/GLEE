"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive first offer, aiming for a large share of the money.  Since the money is worth less with each passing round, it makes sense for Alice to try to secure a large portion as early as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice should reject this offer. While it's a better deal than the previous round, it's still a significant loss for Alice.  Since Alice has a higher inflation rate, there's still a strong incentive for her to continue negotiating and try to secure a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Alice is still in a stronger position because of the higher inflation rate impacting her more. This offer tries to bridge the gap between the previous round's offers, while still giving Alice a larger share.  This could be seen as a compromise to try to reach an agreement."
