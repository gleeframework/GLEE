"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start with a reasonable offer""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to give up 5000. But Bob's message suggests he's not being too aggressive, so I'll consider it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the reduced value of the money, 4500 doesn't seem as appealing as it did earlier.

However, Bob's message suggests he's willing to meet me halfway, which might be a good opportunity to get a better deal.
