I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is slightly better than my last offer, and the inflation is starting to hurt her more than me. It's time to end this game and split the money."
