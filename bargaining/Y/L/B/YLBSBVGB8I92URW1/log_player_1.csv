"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get a nice chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make it worth his while to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him than mine was, but I still think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is taking a toll, and I need to be more aggressive with my offer to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount to make it worth his while to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a pretty reasonable proposal considering the circumstances. I'll take it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
