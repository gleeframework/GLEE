"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the fairness, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  Alice is experiencing significant inflation. Every round that passes makes the deal worse for her. 
* **Improved Offer:**  Alice has moved closer to a more even split, recognizing the impact of the decreasing value on her end.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in future rounds isn't worth the risk that Alice might propose an even worse deal later. 

It's better to accept a reasonably fair offer now than risk getting a much worse offer later due to the inflation affecting Alice's gains."
