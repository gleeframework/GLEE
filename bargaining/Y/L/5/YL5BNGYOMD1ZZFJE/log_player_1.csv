"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $40, and I'll take $60. We can stop here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need to get a bit more to make up for the inflation. Let's stop here.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to conserve my share. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth even less, so I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate. However, I don't want to give up too much, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
