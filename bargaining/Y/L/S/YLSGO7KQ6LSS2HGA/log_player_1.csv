"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, there's no guarantee I'd get a better offer from Bob. Accepting a guaranteed even split now avoids the risk of further inflation diminishing our gains."
