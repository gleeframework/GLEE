Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a tiny share, or if he'll be more aggressive in future rounds.  I'm also hedging against potential inflation, hoping to secure a large portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more than 500,000, I'm not sure how much inflation will impact Bob's offers in the future. Accepting now guarantees me half the money, and with 10 rounds left, there's a chance I can get even more later."
