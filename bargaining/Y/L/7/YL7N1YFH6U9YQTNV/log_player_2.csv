"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  By rejecting, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round and potentially get a bigger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. It's a good foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The money is losing value fast, especially for you. This offer secures a good portion for me while still giving you something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is right about the decreasing value of the money, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split, even though the money is worth less with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I believe we can both do better than this offer. Let's split the difference from the previous round and see if we can reach an agreement.""
}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this falls through. This split ensures a reasonable payout for both of us considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I recognize the urgency and potential for both of us losing, I still believe I can secure a better deal. Alice's offer is still significantly favoring her, and I'm determined to hold out for a more balanced split, even with the time pressure."
