"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm leaving room for him to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
