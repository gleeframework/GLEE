# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's a bit too greedy for my liking.  Let's be reasonable. This offer still benefits you, and takes the inflation into account. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
