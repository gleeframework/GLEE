While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only six rounds remaining, the pressure is on. If I reject this offer, there's a significant risk of walking away with nothing, especially if Bob remains steadfast in his demand for a 50/50 split.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less my share is worth due to inflation. Accepting now guarantees me $5000, which is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has consistently offered an even split and seems unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly propose a deal significantly more favorable to me. 

While I could hold out hope for a slightly better deal, the risks outweigh the potential rewards at this stage."
