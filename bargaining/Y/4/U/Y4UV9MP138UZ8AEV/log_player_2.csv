"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the bigger share, but I leave you with something.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice.  I'm proposing a much fairer split this time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it closer to 60/40.  It's a better deal than last round for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting her more than me, so I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more desperate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a fair deal, especially considering the inflation. Take it or leave it.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's split it evenly and stop this back and forth.  It's the best option for us both now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is right, we're both losing money due to inflation. While I was holding out for a better deal, a 50/50 split is fair at this point. Accepting ensures we both get something rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
