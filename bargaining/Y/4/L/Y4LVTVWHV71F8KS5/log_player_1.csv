Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to hopefully get him to accept quickly. Since he loses 20% of the value with each round, he might see this as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is fair and  I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation."
