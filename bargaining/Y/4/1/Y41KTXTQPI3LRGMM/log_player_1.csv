Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 95 dollars and giving Bob 5 dollars. I want to get the most money possible in the first round, so I'm offering the minimum to Bob.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more money, the inflation rate is already affecting my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's a significant amount. I can't risk losing it all by continuing the game."
