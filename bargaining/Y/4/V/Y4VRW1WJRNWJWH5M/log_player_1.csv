"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think a 60/40 split is too skewed in his favor, especially since I'm the one who made the first proposal. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. Your turn to decide!""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me 55 dollars and Bob 45 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split. 55/45 seems like a good compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it seems like a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet him halfway. The 55/45 split is still a bit in his favor, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I rejected his previous offers."
