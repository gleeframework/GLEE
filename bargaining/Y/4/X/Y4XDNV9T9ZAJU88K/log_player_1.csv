"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, as the inflation will quickly decrease the value of the money if we keep playing.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and with the inflation, the value of my potential gain in future rounds is significantly lower."
