"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you get $40. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the value decreases for you with every round.  I'll take $55, you get $45. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit to end this now.  Agree and we both win.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a way out.  This is the same split you wanted last round, only now *I'm* taking the 'small hit'. Time to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a tough call, but the inflation is eating into my potential gains. Accepting a slightly worse offer now is better than risking getting even less later."
