"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get started with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer, even though it's a fair split.  I'm hoping to get more money, especially considering the inflation will hurt Alice's offer more in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair. Let's avoid going through too many rounds to save money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this split is more reasonable. It's still a fair compromise, but slightly more in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, it's better than risking further inflation and getting even less.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but I'd rather get something than nothing."
