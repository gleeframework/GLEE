"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm taking advantage of the fact that Bob's money is worth 0% less per round.  I'm hoping he'll take the small amount and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject this offer. Even though I'm losing value with each round, I'm still in a much better position to negotiate than I was in the first round. Bob is showing his hand, and I can leverage this to get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm still going for a large share, but I'm offering Bob a slightly larger piece than before to hopefully incentivize him to accept. I'm hoping that with the decreasing value of my money, he'll see this as a good deal and end the game."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is still a bad deal for me. Even with the decreasing value of my money, I'm still better off continuing to negotiate. I need to get a bigger share than 100,000 to make it worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again, but I'm still holding onto the majority. I'm hoping that with the pressure of the decreasing value of my money, he will see this as a good deal and accept it before the value drops further."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While the value of my money is declining, I'm still not getting a good enough share to make it worthwhile. I need to find a way to get closer to a 50/50 split to make it worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than before, but I'm still keeping the majority. The value of my money is decreasing rapidly, so I need to find a way to get a deal done before it drops too far. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough to Bob to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is still not a good deal for me. My money is worth significantly less than in the first round, but I'm still better off continuing to negotiate. I need to get a share closer to 50% to make this worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, but I'm still trying to secure the majority. The value of my money is decreasing quickly, so I need to find a way to close the deal. I'm hoping that with a 60/40 split, Bob will see this as a good deal for him and accept it."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Although the value of my money is decreasing significantly, I'm still not satisfied with a 40% share. I need to try and secure a closer split to make this worthwhile. I believe we can still reach a better agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The value of my money is rapidly decreasing, and I need to find a solution before it drops any further. I believe that a 50/50 split is the most fair outcome, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
