Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. We can negotiate from there if you prefer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! With my gain worth only 85.74% of its original value, I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's new offer, a 55/45 split is still not favorable to me, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain! With my gain worth only 77.38% of its original value, I need to be extremely cautious.

Considering Bob's new offer, a 60/40 split is still not favorable to me, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit, and I don't want to leave too much on the table. I'll make a decision based on the current situation.

# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really accelerating, and my gain is worth only 69.83% of its original value. I need to be extremely cautious and make a decision based on the current situation.

Considering Bob's new offer, a 65/35 split is still not favorable to me, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to leave too much on the table.

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really devastating my potential gain now! With my gain worth only 63.02% of its original value, I'm in a very tough spot.
