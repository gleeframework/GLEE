"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain more significantly, I'll have to think carefully. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share, especially considering the uneven impact of inflation on our gains. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a smaller share for myself to make it more attractive. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 45 is a reasonable share for me, given the current state of the money's value. I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game."
