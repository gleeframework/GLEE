I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself and give 100,000 dollars to Bob.  Let's see if he accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm proposing that I get 700,000 dollars and Bob gets 300,000 dollars. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to make sure I get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'll keep rejecting until I get something closer to what I want."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  We've both rejected each other's offers several times, so it's time to compromise.  This is a fair offer, and it ensures that we both get something."
