"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a small portion, but it's a good start! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\nI've taken into account the 10% decrease in value for me, so I'm trying to get a bit more than the initial offer to compensate for it. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."
