Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  I'm still taking a bigger hit from inflation than you are.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation is going to hurt both of us significantly, and further negotiation likely won't result in a substantially better deal for me."
