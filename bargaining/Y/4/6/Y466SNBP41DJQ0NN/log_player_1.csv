"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, leaving us both with $5,000 each. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. I'll consider the offer from Bob:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further. Your offer is a bit too skewed towards you, Bob.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and asking Bob to consider a more balanced split. It's his turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reevaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. It's a good compromise.""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer, and we can finally divide the money. Bob will get $4,200 and I'll get $5,800."
