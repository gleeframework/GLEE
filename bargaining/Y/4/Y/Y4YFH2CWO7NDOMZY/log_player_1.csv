"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a decent share of the pie. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to be fair, I suppose!

I'll think about it for a moment... With the 5% inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for that. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! With the 14.26% inflation, my gain of $45 is actually worth only $38.72. That's a pretty low offer, considering the original amount was $100.

I'll think about it for a moment... I'd like to get a better deal than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the significant inflation. Since my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
