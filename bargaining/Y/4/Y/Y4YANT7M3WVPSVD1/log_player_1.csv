"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I need to get a better share than the previous offer. Let's work together to find a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and I need to be more cautious. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer, as I'm still not getting a good share of the money, and I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better share, but I need to be cautious with inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself, considering the inflation."
