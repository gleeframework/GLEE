Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  We both need to be realistic about the shrinking pot. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the impact of inflation on her share becomes more apparent.  While this offer is better than her previous one, I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it before inflation hurts us both even more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, time pressure is mounting.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is eroding the value of the money faster for Alice, but it's still impacting my potential gains. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is a strong argument for fairness, and after several rounds of back and forth, it might be the push Alice needs to settle."
