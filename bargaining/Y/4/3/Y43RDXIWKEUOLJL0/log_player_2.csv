Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but we need to work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, so holding out too long is risky, but I need to push for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating into both our potential gains. My offer is more than fair. Let's close this deal and both come out ahead.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Round 2, showing a willingness to compromise, but I'm also making it clear that time is running out and the impact of inflation is significant. The goal here is to convey a sense of urgency and get Alice to agree to a more balanced deal before the value of the money diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every round. Let's meet halfway this time, and we can both avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that we're both losing money, but her idea of ""halfway"" still heavily favors her.  While the offer is tempting considering the inflation, accepting now would send the message that I'm desperate. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she gets more realistic."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than reasonable.  Accept this deal now, or I'm walking away next round.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and every round makes the potential gains significantly worse. I need to apply more pressure.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly from 550,000 to show I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my final offer.
* **Ultimatum:**  The threat of walking away creates a hard deadline for Alice. This might be risky, but the dwindling pot and Alice's stubbornness require a strong tactic."
