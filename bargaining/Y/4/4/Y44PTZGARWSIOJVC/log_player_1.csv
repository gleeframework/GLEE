"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 55/45 split. I'm proposing we go for 60/40, giving you a bit more to make up for the inflation you'll be facing in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
