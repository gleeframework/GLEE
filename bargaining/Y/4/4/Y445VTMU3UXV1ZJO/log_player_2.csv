**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, she's conceding ground more quickly.  It's still worthwhile for Bob to push for a slightly better deal, knowing that each rejection makes Alice more likely to accept a less favorable outcome for her."
