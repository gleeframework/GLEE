"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I've included a message to Bob saying ""Let's be fair!"" to try to persuade him to accept my proposal. Let me know how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself.  Let's settle this before inflation eats into our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 10% less in this round due to inflation, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer of 45 dollars for me and 55 dollars for himself doesn't seem fair enough, so I'll proceed to the next round to try and get a better outcome. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 43 dollars and keeping 57 dollars for myself. Considering the inflation, this is a relatively fair offer. I've included a message to Bob saying ""Let's meet in the middle!"" to try to persuade him to accept my proposal, as it's getting closer to an equal split. Let me know how he responds!"
