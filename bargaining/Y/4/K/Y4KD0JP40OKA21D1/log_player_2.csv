"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I get 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. I'm not sure how Alice's perspective on the inflation works, but I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I wait and propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm willing to be fair, but I also need to consider the impact of inflation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your need to consider inflation, Bob.  But a 60/40 split is too far in your favor.  Let's compromise at 70/30.  This gives you a decent gain, and it's a more equitable solution. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 70/30 is better than the previous offer, I'm still feeling confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to play the long game.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to risk it for the potential of a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 70/30 split in my favor this time. I've considered the impact of inflation and I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of our time. Let's move forward and make a deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer to a solution, Bob.  Let's split the money evenly this time. 50/50 is a fair compromise and ensures we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Alice's offer.  Even though inflation is a concern, the value of my potential gain is dropping significantly with each round. At this point, a 50/50 split ensures I get a substantial amount and minimizes the risk of getting nothing. It's a good outcome, and I'd rather secure a fair deal now than keep pushing for more and risk losing everything."
