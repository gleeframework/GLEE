I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives Bob a small share to consider, but leaves the majority for me.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is not a good deal for me.  The money is worth less than in the first round, and while Bob has lowered his demand to 90%, that's still an enormous share for him. I need to stand my ground and see if he'll compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my share to 60% and offer Bob 40%.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I think it's necessary to avoid losing even more money due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one.  Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but the money is worth significantly less now, and I'm still not happy with getting less than half. I need to see if I can get a better deal, but time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is it, time for a 50/50 split.  We're both losing a lot of money with each round, and I don't see any other way to avoid getting nothing. I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and accept this."
