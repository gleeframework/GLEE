"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7,000 to 3,000 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased, so I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for 5,000 each. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a further decrease in value.
