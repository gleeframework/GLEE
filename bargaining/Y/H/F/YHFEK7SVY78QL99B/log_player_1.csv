Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alright Alice, you drive a hard bargain. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal before the inflation eats away at it any further. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900

This is a tough one, but with the inflation accelerating, it's getting risky.  Bob is unlikely to offer me more than half, and waiting any longer could result in a worse outcome even if I get a slightly better split."
