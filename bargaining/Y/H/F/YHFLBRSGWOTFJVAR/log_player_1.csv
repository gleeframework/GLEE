"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm trying to secure a larger share, knowing that the money will be worth less for Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, knowing that the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round. This should be a more appealing offer to him than the previous 20/80 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2800 
# Bob gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is higher than the previous round, it is still significantly less favorable than my initial proposal.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better deal.  The inflation is hurting Bob more, so I believe I can leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 70/30 in my favor, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before the inflation makes his share even smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3520 
# Bob gain: 6480 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I'm hoping for, even with the substantial inflation affecting him. I'm willing to take the risk of another round and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 80/20 in my favor. The inflation is really hurting Bob at this point, and I believe this offer will be appealing enough for him to accept."
