I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming to secure a quick agreement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation is a serious concern. This offer is at least fair, and I don't want to risk losing everything if we keep going."
