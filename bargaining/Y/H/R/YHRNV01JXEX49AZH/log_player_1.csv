Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial offer, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially since I'm going to be the one proposing next round and can leverage the inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to take advantage of the inflation to make a more favorable offer.  By taking a large share for myself, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept, as his share is still worth more than it would be in the next round due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has hit me harder this round, Bob's offer is now more appealing.  The inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the money, and my potential gains in the next round are likely to be significantly less. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent amount of money in this scenario."
