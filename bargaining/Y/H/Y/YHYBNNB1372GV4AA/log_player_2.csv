"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't quite meet my expectations, considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. I believe I can propose a division that might be more favorable for both of us, taking into account the decreasing value of the money with each round. Let's see how Alice responds to my next offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when I can make my proposal for Round 2.\n\n###\n\nBest,\nBob\n\n###\n\nCan I proceed to make my offer now?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make my proposal for Round 2, considering the inflation and trying to find a mutually agreeable division.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the shares to make it more equitable for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\nBest,\nBob\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation hurts you more than me. I'm sticking with my previous offer, it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand that inflation affects me more, but accepting the same offer as in Round 1 doesn't seem reasonable, especially since the money is now worth 19% less for me. I'd like to proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more balanced division, considering the increasing impact of inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet's continue to Round 4.\n\n###\n\nBest,\nBob\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when I can make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, and I'm trying to find a middle ground that accounts for the loss in value. Let's compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\nBest,\nBob\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at this deal. I'm willing to adjust slightly to end this, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for me, with it now being worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision. Further negotiations could lead to even more loss in value, making this offer the best option under the current circumstances.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game with this agreement.\n\n###\n\nBest,\nBob"
