"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, a fair start""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation that will kick in soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not thrilled about accepting a 50/50 split, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
