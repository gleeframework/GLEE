"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment... 

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $5,000, which is a good amount. However, for Bob, the $5,000 is worth 20% less than in the previous round, which means it's equivalent to $4,000 in the first round's value. 

I'll reject this offer. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, hoping you'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer...

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $4,500, which is a decent amount. However, for Bob, the $5,500 is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means it's equivalent to $2,625 in the first round's value.

Considering the value of the money for Bob is significantly lower than in the previous round, I'll accept this offer.
