"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 400k, it's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a significant departure from the 50/50 split I initially proposed. I'm not sure if I want to give up 200,000$ right off the bat.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a more appealing proposal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was a bit too generous for me, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more one-sided! I'm not thrilled about giving up 700,000$ to him. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. I'm not getting desperate yet, but I'm getting closer to the deadline!"

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, but I'm willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to getting nothing, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting aggressive! I'm not going to let him bully me into taking a tiny fraction of the money. 100,000$ is not even a good starting point, let alone a final offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to make a final push for a better deal. I'm not getting desperate yet, but I'm running out of time!"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting down to the wire! Since Bob's previous offer was laughable, I'll try to make a final proposal that's more reasonable. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's split it fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a fair deal. Let's see if Bob will accept this one and we can finally settle the game!"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of time, take it or lose it all! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","NO WAY! Bob's trying to lowball me with a ridiculous offer! 50,000$ is an insult, and I'm not going to let him get away with it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to make one last stand. I'm not going to let Bob bully me into taking a tiny fraction of the money. I'll make one more proposal and see if I can salvage something."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting desperate! Since Bob's previous offer was an insult, I'll try to make a final proposal that's as close to 50/50 as possible. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 499500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 49.95/50.05 split, which is as close to 50/50 as I can get. Let's see if Bob will finally accept and we can end this game!"
