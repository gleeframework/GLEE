Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the potential for inflation. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
