Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll have to consider it. Since my money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to propose a new one.
