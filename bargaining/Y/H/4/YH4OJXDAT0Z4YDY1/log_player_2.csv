"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and 10% is way too low! I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split. We both get a decent amount, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 65/35. I'm taking into account your offer, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, 3500 is still a decent gain considering the inflation. It's better to secure this offer than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
