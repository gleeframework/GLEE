Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair start, Alice, but I think a 50/50 split is more equitable considering our individual inflation rates. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
