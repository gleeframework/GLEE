"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

Since the offer is now 50/50, I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value, due to two rounds of 20% inflation. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth a significant amount less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing more value due to further inflation.
