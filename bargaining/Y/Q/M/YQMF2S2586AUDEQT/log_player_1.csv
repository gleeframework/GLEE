"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll consider the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 70 - (5% of 70) = 66.5
Bob gain: 30 - (20% of 30) = 24

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I was hoping for a better deal. For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, while still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 75 - (14.26% of 75) = 64.43
Bob gain: 25 - (48.8% of 25) = 12.75

I'm not thrilled with the value of the offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate. I'll consider it. For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
