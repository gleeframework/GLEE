"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a more substantial share of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but 20% of the initial amount is a bit too low for me. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""A compromise: I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small token, but I'm taking the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Oh no, Bob's offer is getting even more one-sided! I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger chunk, but I still want a decent share to keep up with inflation""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping a decent amount for myself, considering the effects of inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
