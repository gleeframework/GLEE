"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best one. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I think I should get a slightly larger share to account for the reduced value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm going to propose a slightly more aggressive split to make up for it. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and be willing to accept it."
