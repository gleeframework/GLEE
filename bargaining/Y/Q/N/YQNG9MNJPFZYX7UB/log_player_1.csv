"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob.  I figure this is a fair offer, as I am taking on the risk of the next round's inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategic choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of my gains is already significantly reduced by 20%.  If I reject, the next round will further decrease the value of my potential winnings.
* **Bob's Offer:**  Even with the 20% inflation, a 300,000 gain is better than risking a potentially lower offer in the next round. 

This offer allows me to secure a significant portion of the money, despite the inflation."
