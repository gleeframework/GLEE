Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a bold move here. I figure Alice might be willing to accept a smaller share to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is starting to bite, and it's likely Alice will continue to be more aggressive in her offers. Taking this deal is the best way to secure a decent amount, even with the inflation hit."
