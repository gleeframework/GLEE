"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer is designed to give me a significant portion of the money while still leaving Bob with something. I'm hoping he'll accept it, especially considering the inflation factor that will kick in if we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is tempting, I can do better. It's in my best interest to continue negotiating and exploit the inflation factor. I still have many rounds left, and Bob's offer isn't a good enough bargain for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm taking advantage of the inflation here. My offer is still better for Bob than the previous 50/50 split since his money is losing value faster than mine. I'm hoping he'll accept this to avoid further loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Although Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, my money is losing value much faster than his. I'm going to continue pushing for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm keeping my offer slightly higher than Bob's last proposal, hoping to tempt him while still maximizing my gain. The inflation is working in my favor, but I need to close this deal before it becomes too unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can do better, especially considering the significant inflation impacting my gains. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

We're getting close to the end. My offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and I think Bob might be getting frustrated with the decreasing value of his money. I need to close this deal quickly before the inflation makes my offer too risky."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly favorable to him, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is impacting my gains heavily, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500} 
```

We're nearing the end, and I need to make a strong offer. While I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, Bob is also feeling the pressure. I believe this is the best split I can secure right now, offering him a substantial share while still getting a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is incredibly lopsided in his favor, the inflation is crippling my gains. With only a few rounds left, I need to accept this offer to avoid getting nothing at all. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the best I can do at this point."
