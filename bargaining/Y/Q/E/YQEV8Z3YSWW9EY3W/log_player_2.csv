"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is better than nothing, it's very likely that Alice will be able to get a better deal for herself in future rounds. The inflation will make the offer less appealing to me, and I have a good chance of getting more by rejecting and forcing Alice to make a proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the potential for inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is still less than what I proposed in round 2, the inflation is hitting me hard. My offer is worth 36% less now, and the money Alice gains is worth almost 10% less.  This means that if I reject, her offer in the next round might be even worse for me. Accepting this offer is the safest option to ensure I get something before inflation eats away at my potential gains even further."
