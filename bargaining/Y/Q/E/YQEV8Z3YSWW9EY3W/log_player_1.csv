"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, where I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. My message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my share more significantly than yours. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more favorable offer that takes into account the inflation's impact on my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, I'll aim for a more favorable ratio. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a compromise."
