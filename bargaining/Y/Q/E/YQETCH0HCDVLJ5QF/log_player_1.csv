Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, so I'm offering you the same deal, but reversed. It's still a good deal before inflation eats away at it further!

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
