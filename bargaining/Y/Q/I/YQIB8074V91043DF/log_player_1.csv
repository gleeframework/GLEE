"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% share for myself and a 10% share for Bob. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 60/40, a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of the money is now worth 5% less than before. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of 60/40. It's a decent compromise, and I'm willing to settle for 400,000."
