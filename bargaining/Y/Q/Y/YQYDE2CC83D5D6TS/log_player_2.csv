It's tempting to accept, but I'm not sure Alice understands the inflation factor. It's worth risking a round to see if we can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fairer deal for both 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice is still trying to get more than half, and I'm not sure she understands how inflation is affecting me. It's risky, but I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""We need to find a split that works for both of us considering how much inflation is impacting the value of the money. I'm offering a slightly smaller share for you this time, but still a larger portion than what you previously offered.""
