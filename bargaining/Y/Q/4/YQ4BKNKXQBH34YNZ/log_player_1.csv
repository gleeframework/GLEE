"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to give me a smaller share, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I need to consider the value of the money I'll be getting. In this round, the total amount is still $10,000, but it's worth less than in the first round due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, I'll try to increase my share this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more this time.""
}
```"
