"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Although the money is worth less than in the first round, it's important to remember that Alice's offer is still better than the 600,000 she offered in the previous round (which was rejected).
* **Risk Assessment:**  Rejecting Alice's offer again carries the risk that she will offer even less in the next round. 
* **Maximizing Gain:** While it's not ideal, accepting this offer still gives Bob a substantial amount of money."
