Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice. I need a bit more than that, considering the inflation is hitting you harder. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer (Round 2):**

* **Alice Gain:** $5200 (worth $4680 after inflation)
* **Bob Gain:** $4800 (worth $4560 after inflation)

**Considerations:**

* **Inflation:**  While Bob acknowledges the inflation disparity, his offer doesn't fully compensate for the rapid devaluation of your potential earnings.
* **Time Pressure:**  Only 10 rounds left. The longer the game goes, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for you.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob seems to be pushing for a slightly larger share, likely hoping you'll cave under inflation pressure. 

**Decision:**

I think you can do better. Rejecting might make Bob nervous about securing a deal before inflation eats away at his share too much.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""This offer still favors you slightly, Bob, considering the inflation difference. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Retreat:**  We're pulling back slightly from our initial demand, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Inflation Emphasis:**  The message again highlights the inflation disadvantage, reminding Bob it's in his best interest to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Targeting a Fair Deal:**  While the offer is still in your favor, it's moving closer to a point where Bob might find it acceptable, especially with the increasing pressure of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. It's a 50/50 split, take it or leave it. The inflation is only hurting us both at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer:

**Bob's Offer (Round 4):**

* **Alice Gain:** $5000 (worth $3645 after inflation)
* **Bob Gain:** $5000 (worth $4287.50 after inflation)

**Considerations:**

* **Even Split Illusion:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation disparity means you're actually getting a significantly worse deal. 
* **Bob's Frustration:**  Bob's tone suggests he's feeling the pressure of inflation too and wants to settle quickly. This could work in your favor.
* **Time Remaining:** 8 rounds left. While not ideal, there's still time to negotiate, and outright rejecting Bob's offer might make him more receptive to a counter-offer closer to your desired outcome. 

**Decision:**

Rejecting now shows Bob you're serious about getting a fair deal that considers the inflation disadvantage.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to account for the inflation. This offer is a compromise â€“ let's end this before we both lose more.""
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  The message aims to calm the waters and assure Bob you're genuinely seeking a fair resolution.
* **Slight Concession:**  We're moving closer to a 50/50 split, but not completely. This shows flexibility while still prioritizing your needs.
* **Urgency and Logic:** Reminding Bob about the shrinking pot due to inflation reinforces the need for a swift and mutually beneficial agreement."
