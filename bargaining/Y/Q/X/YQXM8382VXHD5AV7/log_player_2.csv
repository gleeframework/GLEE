Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to account for the inflation. This offer is a compromise â€“ let's end this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one! While I'd prefer a higher amount, Alice is right about the inflation hitting her side harder.  Waiting longer means we both lose more in real value. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
