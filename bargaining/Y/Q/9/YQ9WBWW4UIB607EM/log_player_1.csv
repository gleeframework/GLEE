Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share, but still leaves Bob with something.  I'm curious to see how he'll react to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of mine, and while the money is worth less due to inflation, it's still a significant amount. I'm not ready to accept this yet. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but recognizing that the value of money is decreasing, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a step in the right direction and be willing to negotiate further."
