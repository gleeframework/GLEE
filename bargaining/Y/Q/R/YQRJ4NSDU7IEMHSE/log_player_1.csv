"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the increasing value differential. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
