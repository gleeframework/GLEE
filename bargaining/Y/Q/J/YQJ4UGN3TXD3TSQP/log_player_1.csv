"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000, considering that with each passing round, the money is worth less for both of us, but more significantly for me. I believe this is a reasonable offer given the circumstances. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation impacts us differently. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $400,000 now is even less valuable than it would have been in the first round. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for me with each round, I need to aim for a better split to compensate for the loss in value. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the increased loss from inflation, I'm willing to compromise but still need a larger share.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, where my share loses 20% of its value with each round, I need to secure a larger portion to counteract this loss. By offering Bob $450,000 and taking $550,000, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different effects of inflation on our shares. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable adjustment and accept this offer."
