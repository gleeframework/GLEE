70.0,30.0,Let's make a deal! I think a 70/30 split is fair considering the inflation working against you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
49.0,51.0,"I'm willing to split the money almost evenly, but I need a little more to make it worth my while.  Let's split it 51/49 and avoid further rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you more than me. I'm dropping my offer slightly, but this is a fair deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm still hoping for a more equitable split.  Let's go with 55/45 and end this quickly.  The longer we wait, the less I get in real terms.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, time is running out! This is my final offer. You need to consider the impact of inflation on your share. Take the 40% before it shrinks even further!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, we're nearing the end.  I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I need at least 60% to make this worthwhile.  Let's end this now with a 60/40 split.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous! I'm lowering my offer again, but this is absolutely my last concession.  You're losing out with every passing round! Let's end this.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, we're in the endgame now.  I'm taking a big risk here, but I need at least 65% to make this worthwhile with the inflation.  If we don't agree, we both get nothing.  Let's end this now with a 65/35 split.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire.  It's clear we both want a deal, so let's be fair and split this 50/50. This is our best chance to avoid going home empty-handed!",Alice,9,
