{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to accept a 75/25 split, but I'm also not sure I want to pass up the opportunity to get $300,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much!""

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit and the effects of inflation!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept this offer, even though it's tempting to just take the small amount and walk away. $50,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $1,000,000, but I think I can still do better than that. I'll take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
