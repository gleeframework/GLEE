Alice's offer:

I'm Bob, and while this offer is decent, I think I can get a better deal. There's a chance of inflation, and I can potentially get a bigger share if I reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
