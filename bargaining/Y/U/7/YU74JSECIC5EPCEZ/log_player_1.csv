Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That wasn't reasonable, Alice. How about we try a fairer split this time? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but that offer was too low. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is phrased more generously, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. I need to push Bob towards a more even split, but I need to be mindful that he might be content to let the clock run out."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a fair offer that considers the impact of inflation on your end. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to use the shrinking pot as leverage.  While his phrasing suggests awareness of the inflation, the offer itself is still tilted in his favor. I'll hold firm for another round and see if I can push him further."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm being more than fair. Take this deal before inflation makes it even less appealing for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Let's not throw away what's left because of stubbornness. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally agreeing to a 50/50 split. While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is steadily eroding my potential gains. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable share, whereas continuing to haggle risks a worse outcome as time runs out."
