Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fairer share considering the value of the money decreases with each round. Let's avoid further losses and come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
