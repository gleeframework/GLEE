60.0,40.0,Let's split 60/40. I believe this is a fair starting point given the rate of inflation we are facing.,Alice,1,

55.0,45.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice.  How about we split a little closer to the middle this time?  Keep in mind the inflation is working against me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but my offer is still fair.  I'm willing to stick with it for now to avoid us getting too deep into this and risking losing more.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, it seems clear we both want a larger share of the pie. But let's be realistic: the longer this drags on, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it or leave it - time is literally money.",Bob,4,
