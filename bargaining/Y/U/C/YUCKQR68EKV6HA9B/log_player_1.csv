"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting the value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more careful.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is equal, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation affecting my potential gain, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the second round), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my potential gain even more, I'll have to be even more cautious.

However, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll take it.
