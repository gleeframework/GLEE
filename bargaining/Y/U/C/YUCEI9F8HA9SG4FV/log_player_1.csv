Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a smaller share, but still a decent amount. I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal or if he's going to try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept Bob's offer now.  Even though I only get $100,000, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
