"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. This is a more balanced offer, let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 45-55 split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, trying to squeeze a bit more for myself."
