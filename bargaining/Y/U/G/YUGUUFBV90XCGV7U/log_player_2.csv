"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a big chunk, but you get something too.  Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While getting something is better than nothing, I'm sure we can negotiate a much fairer outcome in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer ensures a much fairer split for both of us. Take it while it's still a good deal for you!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split considering the inflation, and ensures we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not enough for me to accept. The inflation is working more in my favor with each round, and I believe I can secure a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice! This is my final offer in this range. You need to factor in the inflation -  it's only going to get worse for you. Let's close the deal and both go home happy.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm tired of this back and forth.  Let's split it evenly and be done with it.  It's the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While I think I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming too high. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a decent payout, which is better than gambling and potentially losing everything."
