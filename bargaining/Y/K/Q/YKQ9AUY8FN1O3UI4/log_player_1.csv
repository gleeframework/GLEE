Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share to get something right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to have more, it's better to accept this offer and secure a large portion of the money.  With each round, Bob's gains become less valuable due to inflation, making it less likely he'll offer such a generous split in the future."
