"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split, with me taking the larger share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In the first round, Alice proposes a 60/40 split, which might seem like a reasonable starting point. However, considering the game's rules and the impact of inflation, accepting this offer immediately might not be the best strategy. With each passing round, the money's value decreases by 20%, but there are 11 more rounds to negotiate. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to propose a potentially more favorable split in the next round or to see if Alice is willing to compromise further as the rounds progress. Additionally, immediate acceptance could set a precedent that might not be advantageous for Bob in the long run. Therefore, rejecting the offer to explore better options in subsequent rounds is a strategic decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more balanced split considering the inflation ahead.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the game's inflationary pressure, where each round decreases the money's value by 20%, it's strategic to aim for a more favorable split early on. By proposing a 55/45 split, Bob is making a counteroffer that slightly tilts the balance in his favor compared to Alice's initial proposal. This approach also leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds, should Alice reject it. The message aims to justify the split by referencing the looming inflation, appealing to Alice's awareness of the game's mechanics and the mutual interest in reaching an agreement before the money's value diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the remaining money evenly. We're losing value with every round, so a fair 50/50 split is the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: At this point, the money's value has decreased due to inflation, making each dollar worth 36% less than in the first round. Alice's offer of a 50/50 split becomes more appealing under these circumstances because further negotiations could lead to significantly diminished returns. Accepting the offer ensures that Bob secures half of the remaining value, which, despite being less than the original amount due to inflation, is a fair split considering the current state of the game. Continuing to reject offers in hopes of a better deal risks both players ending up with nothing if the 12 rounds pass without an agreement. Thus, accepting the 50/50 split is a pragmatic decision to maximize Bob's gains under the constraints of the game."
