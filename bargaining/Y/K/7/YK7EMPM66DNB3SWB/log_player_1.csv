"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, my gain of 200,000$ is worth 95% of its original value, which is 190,000$.
Bob's gain of 800,000$ is worth 80% of its original value, which is 640,000$.

Considering the reduced values, I think this offer is more favorable to Bob than to me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the reduced values of the money due to inflation.

My gain of 300,000$ is worth 85.74% of its original value, which is 257,220$.
Bob's gain of 700,000$ is worth 52% of its original value, which is 520,000$.

Considering the reduced values, I think this offer is still more favorable to Bob than to me. I'll reject it.
