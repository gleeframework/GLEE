It's a terrible deal!  I'll be the one to make the next proposal."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Alice a small share to get the game started. Let's see if she's willing to play."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much fairer than her previous one, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with inflation taking its toll.  I'll take the 500,000."
