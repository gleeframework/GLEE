"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to negotiate from here! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject this offer because I'm not willing to give Bob a 70% share of the money, especially since I'm still getting a significant amount. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly, but still trying to negotiate a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think about the relative value of the offer. Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer because I'm not willing to give Bob a 60% share of the money, even with the inflation effect. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fair split. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and keeping a decent amount for myself."
