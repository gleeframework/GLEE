I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, giving myself the larger share. I figure this is a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm proposing a 8500/1500 split.  I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've reduced my demand slightly to account for the inflation.  I think this is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 7500/2500 split.  I'm aware the inflation is getting more significant, but I'm still hoping for a fair share. This is a final attempt to reach an agreement."
