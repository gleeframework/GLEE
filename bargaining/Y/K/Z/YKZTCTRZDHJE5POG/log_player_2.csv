"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** It's crucial to recognize that the value of the money decreases each round. Alice's offer in Round 1 might have seemed fair initially, but it becomes less appealing with each passing round.
* **Strategic Offer:** My offer aims to be enticing enough for Alice to accept while also considering the declining value.  I'm taking a slightly larger share than Alice, but it's important to leave her with a reasonable amount to incentivize her acceptance. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message to Alice clearly explains the rationale behind my offer, making it more likely she'll understand and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet halfway 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame her offer as generous due to the ""meet halfway"" concept. However, she's not accurately factoring in the *differential* in inflation.  We're losing value at twice her rate! While her offer might seem tempting compared to my previous one, holding out for a better deal in Round 4 is still the strategically sound move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time Pressure:**  It's Round 4, and the value of the money is dwindling fast for both of us.  
* **Apparent Fairness:** A 50/50 split *appears* fair on the surface and might be more appealing to Alice now than in earlier rounds.  
* **Strategic Compromise:** While I'd prefer a larger share, the longer this goes on, the less we both gain. This offer represents a compromise to close the deal before inflation erodes the value further."
