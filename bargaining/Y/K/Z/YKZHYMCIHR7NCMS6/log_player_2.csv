Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 520000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting worse for her due to inflation, but they are still not at a point where she's desperate enough to accept a truly fair deal. Holding out longer puts more pressure on her as the value of her potential winnings decreases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This is a fair deal, let's not waste any more time and secure our gains.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Pressure:** We continue to slightly increase our demand, keeping the pressure on Alice as the value of her potential gains diminishes with each round.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering Alice slightly more than her last offer could make her think we're being reasonable and might be willing to settle closer to a 50/50 split. This could make her more likely to accept a deal in the next round or two.
* **Time Factor:**  With only six rounds remaining, Alice should be feeling the urgency.  This offer, while still advantageous to us, might look appealing enough to her given the rapidly approaching deadline."
