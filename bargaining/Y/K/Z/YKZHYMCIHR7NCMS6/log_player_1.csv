Let's see how this plays out. Bob is being greedy, but time is working against me. I need to formulate a counter-offer that seems appealing but still gets me a decent amount."

Bob is getting closer to my Round 3 offer, but I need to hold my ground a little longer.  The inflation is hurting, but giving in now will cost me too much in the long run."

Bob has met my offer from Round 5, and the effects of inflation are only getting worse. Accepting now locks in a reasonable amount, even considering the losses I've incurred due to inflation."
