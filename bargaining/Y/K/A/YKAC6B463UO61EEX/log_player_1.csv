"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'm not too thrilled about Bob taking the majority, but I suppose it's a decent offer. I'll accept.
