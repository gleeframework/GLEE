"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While it seems unfair, it's a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than getting nothing in the final round, it's still a significant drop from my initial proposal. I'm confident I can secure a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain to 750,000, hoping to find a compromise.  Bob's offer was too low, but I'm willing to move a bit closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  This offer at least guarantees me something, and with each round, the chances of getting a better deal are getting slimmer."
