"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. A fair deal for both of us right now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I understand you want a fair deal, but let's consider the time value of money. How about 55/45?""}
``` 
 
This offer attempts to take a more advantageous position while acknowledging Alice's desire for fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing quickly. Let's be sensible and split it 50/50 before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further devaluation of the money."
