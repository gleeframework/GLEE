"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take $60. This is a fair starting offer, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.
