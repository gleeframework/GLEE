# Alice's message: You should've taken my previous offer, now I'm being less generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is steadily decreasing her offer, taking advantage of my shrinking pot. While the difference is getting smaller, it's worth holding out a bit longer to see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split or at least a slightly better offer."

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me. While this isn't ideal, getting only $45 is better than nothing if we run out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and accept."
