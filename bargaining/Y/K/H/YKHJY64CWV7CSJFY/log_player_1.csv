I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept in the first round. It's important to secure a significant portion of the money early on due to the inflation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation. Accepting this offer would mean I'm effectively getting half of the remaining money, but after the inflation adjustment, it would be significantly less than 500,000. I'll reject and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not enough to compensate for the significant inflation. I'm still losing a significant portion of the money due to inflation. I will continue to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse. Even though the inflation is biting hard, I still believe I can secure a better deal. This offer is too low for the remaining rounds and the impact of inflation. I will continue to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm making a final effort to secure a decent share of the money.  The inflation is severe, and I'm losing a significant amount with each passing round. However, I still believe I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer.  I need to take a risk and hope Bob will accept."

Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While it is a painful decision, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  The inflation has been brutal, but accepting this would mean I'm walking away with less than $50,000 after the inflation adjustment. I'd rather risk getting nothing at all than to settle for such a small amount."
