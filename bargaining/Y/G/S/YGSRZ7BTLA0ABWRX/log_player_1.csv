"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 40-60 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / 0.9 = 3333.33
* Bob gain: 7000

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round for me, and 0% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this time, Bob. Hope you accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $7,500 and keeping $2,500 for myself."
