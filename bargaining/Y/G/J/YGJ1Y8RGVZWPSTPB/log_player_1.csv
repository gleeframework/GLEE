"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the sound of Bob taking the majority! Considering the inflation effect, my $2,000 gain is worth significantly less than the $6,000 I proposed in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're taking the majority, but I'm still hoping for a decent share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking most of the cash, deal with it! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting tougher and tougher! Considering the inflation effect, my $1,000 gain is worth a mere 10% of what I would have gotten in the first round. I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to hold out for a better deal.

```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm getting close to desperation, but I'll try to make one last stand. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a very low share, but I'll try to get something. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250,
  ""bob_gain"": 9750,
  ""message"": ""I'm going for broke, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 2.5-97.5 split, with me getting a mere $250 and Bob getting $9,750. It's a long shot, but I'm hoping Bob will feel sorry for me and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting nothing, it's take it or shut up! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 9995 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a very harsh offer! Considering the inflation effect, my $5 gain is almost worthless. I'm not getting anything, so I might as well accept this offer. I'm not happy about it, but I don't have much choice.
