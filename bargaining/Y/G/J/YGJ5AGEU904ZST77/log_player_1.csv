"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob would get the remaining 40%, which is $400,000. The message ""Let's divide it fairly"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that the offer is reasonable and that accepting it would be a fair outcome for both players. By starting with a higher offer for herself, Alice is trying to set the tone for the negotiations and also considering the impact of inflation, which will reduce the value of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both get a little more. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlice rejects Bob's offer because it gives Bob a larger share of the money, and considering the inflation, Alice's share of $400,000 is now worth less than it would have been in the first round. Alice is motivated to continue negotiating to try to secure a better deal for herself, given the decreasing value of the money for her and the time pressure of having only 12 rounds to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet halfway from my first offer""}\n\nAlice's new offer is an attempt to compromise and move closer to a mutually acceptable division. By proposing a 55% share for herself, which is less than her initial 60% offer but still higher than Bob's proposed 40% for her, Alice is trying to find a middle ground. The message ""Let's meet halfway from my first offer"" communicates her willingness to negotiate and find a compromise, while also considering the impact of inflation on her share's value."
