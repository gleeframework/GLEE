Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split. I'm willing to be generous in the first round, as the inflation will start to eat away at my share if we keep going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Although I'm losing out on some money due to the inflation, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the risk of getting nothing if we continue."
