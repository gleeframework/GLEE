"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, my gain of 5500 is now worth less than my initial offer of 6000. I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the continued inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping to avoid further erosion of my potential gain due to inflation."
