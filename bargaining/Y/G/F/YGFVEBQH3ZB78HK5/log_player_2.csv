"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the 10% inflation, I'd rather try to get a better deal than accept this initial offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation that affects me more.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation rate affects me more than Alice. I've also included a message to justify my proposal and appeal to Alice's understanding of the game's conditions. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. I'm willing to compromise, but I also need to account for the inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice has made a compromise by offering an equal split, I think it's a reasonable deal. The money is worth less now, but an equal split seems fair given the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to ensure I get something rather than risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
