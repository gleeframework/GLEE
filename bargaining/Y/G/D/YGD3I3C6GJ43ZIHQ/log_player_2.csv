"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous split. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  I'll see if I can negotiate a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be more equitable this time. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  We both still get a significant amount, and it gives us a good starting point for negotiations.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob, but this offer is still fair given the inflation. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount, and any further rounds risk losing even more due to inflation."
