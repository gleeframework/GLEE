I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share!  I'll offer Bob 100,000$ and keep 900,000$ for myself.  Let's see if he takes it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While Bob is taking a larger share, the inflation is working against me. If I accept this offer, I will end up with much less than what I would have gotten if I had accepted his first offer in round 1. I'm not going to give in so easily!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced offer this time. I'll offer Bob 300,000, keeping 700,000 for myself. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation is hitting us both, but I still want to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  The inflation is making each round less appealing, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. While I would prefer a larger share, this offer gives me a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
