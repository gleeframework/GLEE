"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant sum. Let's avoid the effects of inflation and settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is a good offer for me in round 1, I want to see if I can get a better deal later on.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe this split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, especially for you. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation is hurting me, and this isn't the ideal split, time is running out. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
