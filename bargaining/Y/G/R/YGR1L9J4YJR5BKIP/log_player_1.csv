Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for Bob. This works in my favor.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer might seem ""fairer"" on the surface, the longer we wait, the worse it gets for him. He's incentivized to offer me more.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, I signal I'm not desperate and am willing to play the game. This puts pressure on Bob to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out, especially for you. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're entering Round 3 out of 12, and inflation is eating away at the value, particularly for Bob. He's feeling the heat to make a deal.
* **Strong Stance:** My previous rejection and this firm ""final offer"" message are designed to show Bob I'm serious about getting a favorable split. 
* **Strategic Retreat (Slightly):** I've increased my share slightly from my Round 1 offer. This might seem counterintuitive, but it serves two purposes:
    * It acknowledges that Bob's position has improved a tiny bit due to inflation.
    * It makes my ""final offer"" seem more ""generous"" and potentially more appealing to accept.

This strategy is a calculated gamble, aiming to capitalize on the time pressure and secure a significant portion of the money."
