"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a significant departure from the initial 60-40 split, with him taking a much larger share of the $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I think I can do better than a 30-70 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3, trying to get a better share for myself. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share.""
}
```

My offer is a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. My message to Bob is to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bigger chunk of the pie. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer in Round 4 is still quite lopsided, with him taking a 65% share of the $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer as well, as I don't think it's a fair division of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer for Round 5, trying to get a better share for myself. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50-50 split seems fair to me.""
}
```

My offer is a 50-50 split, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000. My message to Bob is to see if he's willing to split the money evenly."
