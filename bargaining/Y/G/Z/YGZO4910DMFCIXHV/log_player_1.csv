I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This way, I get the majority of the money, while still giving Bob a small share.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I'm open to hearing what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is unfair! I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept such a drastic shift in the balance of the money. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. We each take a significant portion of the money, which is fairer than the previous proposals.  I'm hoping we can reach a compromise this round."
