"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and gives Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
