"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100 and Bob gets nothing. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair proposal from Bob! Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll consider that in my decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
