"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, and then we can adjust from there! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. However, meeting in the middle is a reasonable starting point, and I don't want to reject it outright.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to get Bob to consider a slightly more favorable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the split, but I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer, hoping that the value of the money will stabilize or even increase in the future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can move on to the next round."
