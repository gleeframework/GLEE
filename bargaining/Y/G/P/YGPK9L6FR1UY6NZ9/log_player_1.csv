"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can work together and make more money in the future.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting with a high offer, I'll try to do better 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll take into account the reduced values.

My gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of the original value, which is $285,000 (0.95 x $300,000). Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 80% of the original value, which is $560,000 (0.8 x $700,000).

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my gain, but I think this is a more reasonable offer than the previous one. I'll accept the offer.
