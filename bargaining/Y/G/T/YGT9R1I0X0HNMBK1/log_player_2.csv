Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're losing a lot of value with each passing round. Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day. This is the fairest deal we'll get. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  Even though the value is decreasing, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  It's better to get something than to risk getting nothing at all."
