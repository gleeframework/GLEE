"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take 70% and you get 30%. It's a fair deal considering the risk. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 300,000 dollars is a lot of money, it's worth considering the potential for a better deal.  Since the value of the money decreases with each round, there's a chance for Bob to get a larger share in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage since you made the first offer.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a new division. I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%. This way, both of us can still benefit from the initial amount while accounting for its decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the ideal scenario would be a 50/50 split, accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice. The inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money for Bob, and accepting a 40% share is still a substantial gain. There's no guarantee that rejecting this offer will result in a better deal in the future, and it's important to consider the diminishing value of the money."
