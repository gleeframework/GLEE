Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, this is a good deal

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While this offer is significantly less than the initial 400,000, Bob is losing a significant amount of value with each round due to inflation. Accepting is the best option to avoid losing even more money."
