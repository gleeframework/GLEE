"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take most, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with only 10% of the total amount. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more even split.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, so I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer. I'm still leaving room for negotiation, but I'm hoping to get a larger share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least 6000 to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer that takes advantage of the inflation.\n\n###\n\nAlso, considering the inflation, Alice's gain of 6000 is actually worth around 4860 in terms of the original value, so I'm not too impressed by her ""compromise""."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be a bit more generous, but I'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to drive a harder bargain, considering the inflation is working in my favor. I'm offering Alice a smaller share, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer or make a counteroffer that I can work with."

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, Alice's gain of 5000 is actually worth around 3280 in terms of the original value. Given this, I think I can still get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer that takes advantage of the inflation.\n\n###\n\nI'll try to make an offer that seems fair on the surface but actually benefits me more due to the decreasing value of the money for Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You should take it before the money loses even more value.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to make an offer that seems reasonable, but actually takes advantage of the inflation. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. The decreasing value of the money for Alice gives me leverage to drive a harder bargain."

It was a good game!"
