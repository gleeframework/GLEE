Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. Time is money, and we both lose if this drags on. This offer gives me a slight edge, acknowledging my risk in rejecting your initial proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
