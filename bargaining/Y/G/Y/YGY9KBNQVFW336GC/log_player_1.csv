"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit conservative. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value, my gain of 5000 in this round is worth 4000 in the previous round's value.

I'll think about it for a moment... I'm not sure I want to accept this offer. I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

```
{ ""decision"": ""reject"" }
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Accept this and we can finally settle this!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better offer. Don't expect much more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the decreased value, my gain of 4000 in this round is worth approximately 1666 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm not sure I can do better at this point. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

```
{ ""decision"": ""accept"" }
