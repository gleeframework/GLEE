"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a relatively small amount to try to keep the negotiations going. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the game."
