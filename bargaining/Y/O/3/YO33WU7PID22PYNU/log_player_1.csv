Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time.  50/50. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is for an even split nominally, the inflation is working heavily in my favor. He's losing value rapidly with each round. I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  This is my last offer before the inflation gets really bad. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is now better than the 50/50 split Bob offered in Round 4 considering the significant impact of inflation on his share.  It's better to secure a reasonable win now than risk the deal falling apart in later rounds."
