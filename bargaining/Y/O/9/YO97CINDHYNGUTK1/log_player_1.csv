"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a simple and fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $240,000. I'm not sure if Bob's share is worth more or less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to negotiate further.

```
