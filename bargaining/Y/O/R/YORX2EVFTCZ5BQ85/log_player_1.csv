"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  I'm trying to be generous, but I want to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is terrible! I'm getting a much smaller share of the money, and the inflation is hurting me. I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money 75/25 in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to take a smaller amount now than risk getting nothing later if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. Even with inflation, I'm getting less than half of the money. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money 80/20 in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to take a smaller amount now than risk getting nothing later if we keep rejecting each other's offers. I'm also taking into account the inflation, and I'm trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm taking this offer. Although it's less than I was hoping for, the inflation is really hurting me. I'm getting 500,000, which is still a good amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we continue to reject each other."
