"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work something out for the next round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to propose a split that is more favorable in the next round, before the money loses more of its value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount.""}
