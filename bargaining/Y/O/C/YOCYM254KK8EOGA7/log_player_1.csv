"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a bit more for my efforts 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is as generous as he claims. With the 5% inflation, the money is worth less, but I still think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll aim to get a better deal this time. Here's my counter-proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to be generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. With the inflation taking its toll, the money is worth significantly less than it was initially. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, I think I can do better than this. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor, considering the value of the money has decreased.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give up more than this""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly more even split, but still trying to maintain some advantage. Let's see if Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to back down, I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive in his demands. With the inflation taking its toll, the money is worth significantly less than it was initially, and I'm starting to feel the pinch.

However, I think I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob. His offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor, considering the value of the money has decreased.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'll have to be more careful, though - the money is worth less and less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
