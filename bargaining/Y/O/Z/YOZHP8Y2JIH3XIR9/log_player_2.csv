"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's too early to accept such a lopsided deal. Let's see if Alice is willing to be more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I think we both deserve a significant share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up some of my share to reach an agreement. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's getting late in the game, and while I'd prefer a more even split, it's better to take a significant share than risk getting nothing."
