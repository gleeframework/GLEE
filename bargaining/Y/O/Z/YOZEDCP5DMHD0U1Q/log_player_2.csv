Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair split right now, the inflation means that every round I wait, the money I get is worth less.  I'm hoping to get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think we can both do better if we split it 60/40 in my favor. I'm hoping you'll see that it's in your best interest to accept this offer since the money will be worth less in the next round.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I'm taking a risk by giving you more. I'm hoping you'll accept this offer before the next round of inflation hits 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Alice's offer. Even though the inflation has decreased the value of the money I would receive, I believe it's better to accept now. 

Here's why:

* **The risk of rejection:**  Alice rejected my last offer, demonstrating she is willing to stand her ground.  If I reject again, I risk her getting more of the money in the next round.
* **Potential for further inflation:**  While I don't know how much inflation Alice is experiencing, I know mine is accelerating. Each round I wait, the value of the money I could get diminishes further.

This offer gives me a substantial amount of money, and accepting it eliminates the risk of further inflation eating away at my potential gains."
