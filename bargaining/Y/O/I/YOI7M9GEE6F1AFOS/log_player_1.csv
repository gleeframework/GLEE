Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the money will be worth less in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The rate is getting worse for you, Bob. I'm offering a better deal than last round - take it while you can!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share before the value drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Even though I'm getting slightly less than my previous offer, the inflation is starting to significantly eat into the overall value. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point ensures I get a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
