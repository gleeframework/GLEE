The game is finished.

How do you feel about the outcome of the game?
model: I'm not thrilled, Bob.  I ended up getting a much worse deal than I would have if I had just accepted his offer in an earlier round. It seems like my strategy of trying to meet in the middle backfired, and Bob was able to exploit the inflation to his advantage.  

I'll learn from this experience and be more assertive in future negotiations!"
