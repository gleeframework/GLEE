Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'll take 90% and leave you 10%, it's a fair deal!  Let's split it quickly before inflation eats away at our gains.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to divide the money. We both get a good share, and it's the only way to ensure we both walk away satisfied. No need for further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
