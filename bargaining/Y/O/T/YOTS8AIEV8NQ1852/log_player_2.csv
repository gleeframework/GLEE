"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 3:2. It's fair and reasonable given the risk involved. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept a 400,000$ gain, but with the risk of inflation, it's better to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round.  The potential for a better deal is worth the gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 6:4, reflecting the fact that I'm taking on the risk of rejecting your previous offer. It's a fair compromise.""}
