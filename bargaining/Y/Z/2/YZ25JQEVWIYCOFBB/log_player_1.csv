"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual amount I'll get as 500000 * (1 - 0.05) = 475000.

Similarly, since the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, he'll get 500000 * (1 - 0.10) = 450000.

Considering these adjusted amounts, I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give myself a slightly larger share, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the adjusted amounts:

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual amount I'll get as 500000 * (1 - 0.1426) = 428750.

Similarly, since the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, he'll get 500000 * (1 - 0.271) = 362500.

Considering these adjusted amounts, I'll decide to...
