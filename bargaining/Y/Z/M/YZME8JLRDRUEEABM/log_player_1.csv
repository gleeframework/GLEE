"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. So, in real terms, I'm being offered $250,000, which is 40% of the original $600,000 I was offered in the first round.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'd like to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%). So, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take the crumbs! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money I gain in this round being worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (64% of 80%), I'm being offered $100,000, which is a significant decrease from my previous offers.

However, I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a decision. Considering the significant decrease in value, I'd rather take the crumbs than risk going home with nothing.
