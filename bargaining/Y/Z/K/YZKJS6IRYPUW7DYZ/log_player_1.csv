"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher percentage, but I still want to keep the majority. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth another 5% less.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly lower percentage, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to inch up the percentage a bit, but still keeping a slight edge. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher percentage, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth a significant 14.26% less.

I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take this offer. It's not ideal, but I'm getting a bit worried about the value of the money decreasing with each passing round."
