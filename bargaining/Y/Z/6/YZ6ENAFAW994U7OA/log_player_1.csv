"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll calculate my gain in the second round as 90% of 3000, which is 2700. I'll accept Bob's offer.
