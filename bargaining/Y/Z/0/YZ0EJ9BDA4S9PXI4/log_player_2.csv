"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems fair at the moment, there's a lot of time left in the game. I'm going to try and push for a better deal for myself, considering the inflation rate will affect Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more evenly, but keep in mind the inflation rate will impact us both differently.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more, but still fair 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is slightly better for me than the first round, Alice is still getting a much larger share, and inflation is hurting her more than me. I'll try to push for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, this way we both benefit from the remaining rounds and avoid the heavy impact of inflation.""}
