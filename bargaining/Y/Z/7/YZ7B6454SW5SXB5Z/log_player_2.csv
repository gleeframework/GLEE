"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair offer considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, the inflation will affect me significantly over the next 12 rounds. I believe I can get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  While inflation will hit me harder, I think this is a fair compromise considering I'm giving you a chance to get something in the first round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer in round 2 was cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor.  It acknowledges the inflation disparity but ensures we both leave with something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is quickly eroding my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I hoped for."
