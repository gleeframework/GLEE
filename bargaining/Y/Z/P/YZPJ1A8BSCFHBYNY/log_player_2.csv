"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal for Round 2. Since Alice's offer was quite generous, I'll try to get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are already kicking in!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Alice's offer is still quite generous. I'll accept it this time.
