"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk too""}

I'm proposing that I take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob takes the remaining 20%, which is $2,000. I'm trying to make a fair offer, but also taking a slightly larger share since I'm making the initial proposal."
