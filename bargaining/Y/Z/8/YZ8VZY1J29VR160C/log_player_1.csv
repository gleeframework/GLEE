"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the reduced purchasing power.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm pushing for a 70-30 split in my favor, hoping to make up for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not sure if a 50-50 split is fair. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even lower values.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that the reduced value of the money will be a fair compromise.
