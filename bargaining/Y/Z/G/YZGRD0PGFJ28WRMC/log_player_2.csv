"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my gains. While the offer seems fair at first glance, I know that with each passing round, the money will be worth less to me. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little less this round, but I think this is a fair deal that allows us both to come out ahead.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to give you a good share, but I won't go lower than this. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still want to maximize my gains, the inflation is starting to hurt. This offer is better than what I would get if we continue to the next round, so I'll take it."
