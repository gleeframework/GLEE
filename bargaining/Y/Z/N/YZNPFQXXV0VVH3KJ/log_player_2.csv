Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my first offer, now I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the offer now. Although it's not a fair split, my gains keep declining with each round.  Taking this offer ensures I get *something* instead of potentially losing out entirely with more rounds."
