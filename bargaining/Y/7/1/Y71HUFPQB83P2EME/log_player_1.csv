"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's share, I'm not as keen on this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still affecting Bob's share, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite extreme! With the inflation rate being 48.8% less than the first round, Bob's share is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to find a more reasonable middle ground. Considering the inflation is still affecting Bob's share, I'll make a more moderate offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise!"
