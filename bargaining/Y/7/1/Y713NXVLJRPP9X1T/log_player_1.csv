"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our game!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is fair, especially considering that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with each of us getting $50."
