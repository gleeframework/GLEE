"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the smaller share, I'll get the majority""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. My message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a smaller share and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $8,000 is now worth $6,400.

I like Bob's message, and meeting halfway sounds like a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer and we can split the money 50/50."
