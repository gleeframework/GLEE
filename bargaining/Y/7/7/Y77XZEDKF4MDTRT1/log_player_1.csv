Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's satisfied with this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still offering a substantial amount to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll realize that continued rejection could lead to a much worse outcome for him due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is not ideal, but with the inflation working against me, accepting it is the best option. While I'm getting a lot less than I initially hoped, rejecting and continuing could lead to an even worse outcome for me.  I'll take the 50,000 and end this game."
