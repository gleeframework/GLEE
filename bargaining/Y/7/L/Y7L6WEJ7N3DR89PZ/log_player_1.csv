Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation favors me, but your initial offer was far too low.  Let's be reasonable.  This offer leaves us both with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000
