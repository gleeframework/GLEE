"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start enjoying our shares!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","A tough decision! With the inflation affecting Bob's share, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, I'm also not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 80% of the original amount, I'll make a counteroffer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
