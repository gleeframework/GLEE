I'll start with a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure I have the advantage of going first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to recover some of the money I lost by being greedy in the first round.  70/30 is still a decent split in my favor, considering inflation."
