Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Bob, considering his future purchasing power. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 60/40 split might seem unfair on the surface, the inflation factor drastically changes things. As the game progresses, the value of money decreases for both players, but it decreases at a faster rate for Bob. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a significant portion of the money before its value diminishes too much."
