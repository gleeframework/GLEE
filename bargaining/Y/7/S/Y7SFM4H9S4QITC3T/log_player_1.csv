"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, as I believe that in the first round, Bob is more likely to accept a small amount just to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I accept this offer because even with the inflation factor, I'm getting a lot more than I would if the game continued and I risked getting nothing."
