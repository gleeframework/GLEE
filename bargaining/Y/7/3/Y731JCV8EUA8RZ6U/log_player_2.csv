"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's split it 60/40,  with the majority going to me as the proposer in this round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The decreasing value of the money makes each round more critical for me (Bob). I need to push for a more equitable split."
