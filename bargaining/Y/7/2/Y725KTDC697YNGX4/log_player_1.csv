"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as it leaves Bob with something while still giving me the majority share. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and with each round, the value of the money decreases. It's better to take what I can get now than risk losing everything."
