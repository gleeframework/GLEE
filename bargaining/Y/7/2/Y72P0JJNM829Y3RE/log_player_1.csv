"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, let's split it fairly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a chance to get more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of $800,000 is now worth $640,000.

Bob's offer in Round 2 is $250,000, which is 33.33% of the current amount. I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
