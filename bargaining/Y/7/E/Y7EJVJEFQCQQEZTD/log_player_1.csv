Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  This is a good starting point, and I believe it is fair considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
