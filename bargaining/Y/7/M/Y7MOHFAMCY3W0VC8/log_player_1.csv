Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the money will depreciate faster for you than for me.  Let's see if we can both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
