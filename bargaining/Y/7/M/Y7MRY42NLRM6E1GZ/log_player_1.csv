"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 20% of the total, which is $2000, and I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $8000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60% of the total, but I think I deserve a bit more for making the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I agree with Bob's reasoning, but I'll consider the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, $6000 is actually 60% of the new total, which is $6000. And Bob's gain of $4000 is 40% of the new total.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
