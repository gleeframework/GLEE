"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going for a strong opening offer, aiming for the majority share. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Bob will see the benefit of taking a smaller portion now rather than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, taking 500,000 now is better than risking getting nothing later due to inflation. Bob's offer is fair, and accepting it guarantees me a significant amount of money."
