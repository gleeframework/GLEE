I propose a 5500/4500 split. I'm taking a bit more since the inflation hurts Bob more.  Let's see if he agrees!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject.  I might be getting less than I wanted, but inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I'm sure he'll be willing to offer me more to get this over with."

Bob is getting greedy!  Even though inflation is hurting him, his offer is too low.  I'll reject and see if he'll make a more reasonable proposal next time."

Bob's offer is just insulting!  He's taking advantage of the inflation and I refuse to give in.  I'm going to make a counter-offer in the next round."
