Round 2

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value each round, don't wait too long 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. It seems she's trying to pressure me with the inflation factor. However, accepting a deal where I get significantly less isn't a good strategy. I need to hold out for a more balanced offer, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. I'm offering you a slight advantage - let's close the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing a lot of value, accept this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
