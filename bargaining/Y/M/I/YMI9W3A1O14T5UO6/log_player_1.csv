Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. This is a much better deal for you than waiting longer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm thinking... Bob's offer is tempting since the value for me decreases each round. However, his tone suggests he's aware of my disadvantage and wants to take advantage. I should try to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage.
