"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 sounds reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 70 dollars is worth 70 * 0.95 = 66.5 dollars, and Bob's 30 dollars is worth 30 * 0.9 = 27 dollars.

I'm not thrilled about the idea of taking only 66.5 dollars, but I'm not sure if I want to continue negotiating. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take 75 dollars, which is worth 75 * 0.95^2 = 66.375 dollars, and leaving 25 dollars, which is worth 25 * 0.9^2 = 22.5 dollars for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."

I'm not sure if I want to take 68.43 dollars, but I'm not sure if I want to continue negotiating either. I'll reject this offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate.
