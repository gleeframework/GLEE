6000.0,4000.0,"I think a 40/60 split is a good starting point. It's fair, and gives us both a decent amount to work with.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work!",Bob,2,

7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer.  Let's try 70/30 this time.  If we can't find common ground, we'll both end up with less as the rounds go on.",Alice,3,

5500.0,4500.0,"Let's try a 45/55 split this time.  We're both losing money with each round, and this feels like a reasonable compromise.  It's closer to my previous offer and gives you a larger share, but hopefully, we can agree on something before it's too late.",Bob,4,
