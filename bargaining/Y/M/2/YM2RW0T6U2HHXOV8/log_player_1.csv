"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me taking the smaller share this round, to try to set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority this round, but I'll give you a decent share too 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 60% of the remaining value, especially since I'm not sure how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to be more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority this round, but I'll give you a fair share. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, trying to take a stronger stance while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While I appreciate the slightly larger share, I don't want to give up 45% of the remaining value, especially considering the high inflation rate. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and trying to be more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75/25 split, trying to take a stronger stance and get a larger share to account for the accelerating inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up my chance for a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

While it's not ideal, I think it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money. A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome, given the circumstances."
