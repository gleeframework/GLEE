"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is more fair, and if you accept, we can move on.  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of the initial $40, which is $32.

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I would be getting less than I initially proposed. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 64% of the initial value (since it's 80% of 80% of the original amount). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you more. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me 32% of the initial $100, which is worth $32 after inflation."
