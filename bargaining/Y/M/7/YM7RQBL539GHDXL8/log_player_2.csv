"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. Take 10% and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to take the $1000, but knowing that inflation is a factor, holding out for a better deal might be more advantageous in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bigger share. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is better than my previous proposal. While the inflation is a factor, the potential gains from a longer negotiation are outweighed by the certainty of a decent payout."
