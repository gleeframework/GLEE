Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the majority. This is a good deal for you, consider it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is barely budging. While the penalty for inflation is increasing, holding out for a much fairer deal is still the better option. It's unlikely Alice wants to walk away with nothing, so the pressure is on her to propose something more reasonable."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get concerned about the time, Bob.  This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing hardball, but her final offer is still incredibly lopsided. Even with the inflation penalty, holding out for a better deal in the remaining rounds is the best move. Alice's ""final offer"" bluff suggests increasing desperation, meaning Bob might be able to secure a much larger share in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""That 'final offer' wasn't serious, Alice.  This is my last offer.  Take it or we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to turn up the heat on Alice. By mirroring her ""final offer"" tactic but with a much more reasonable split, Bob shows he's serious.  The 55/45 split, while slightly favoring Bob, is still a decent outcome for Alice considering the circumstances. This puts the pressure on her to accept before the value diminishes further for Bob, and potentially forces her to concede an even larger share in the next round if she rejects."
