Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, and she's winning.  Here's why I'm forced to accept:

* **Shrinking Pie:** My share is being eaten away by inflation with each round. 
* **No Guarantee:** There's no guarantee I can propose anything in future rounds that Alice will accept. 
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Taking $300,000 now, heavily impacted by inflation, is still better than risking getting nothing if the game continues and the value plummets further."
