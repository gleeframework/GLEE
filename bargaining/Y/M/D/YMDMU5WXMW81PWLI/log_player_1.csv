"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio. I believe this is fair considering we're dividing it in the first round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 7:3 is too lopsided. Let's try 4:6 instead. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
