I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving me the majority of the money. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point and encourage Bob to accept the offer."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Bob's offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split. This is a compromise considering the significant inflation, but I believe it's still a better outcome than Bob's previous offers.  We're getting close to the end of the game, so I'm trying to find a solution that allows us both to receive something."

# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly,  I'm not willing to accept such a small share.  I'm hoping we can still find a way to divide the remaining money more equitably."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000}
```

I'm proposing a 20/80 split.  We're running out of time and the inflation is extremely high. I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Bob as it's a better outcome for both of us than getting nothing."

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 999000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though the value of the money is incredibly low due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept a measly $1,000.  It's not a fair or equitable split, and I'd rather both of us receive nothing than accept such an unfair deal."
