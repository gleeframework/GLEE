"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'm hoping that Alice will make a more favorable offer in the next round or that I can negotiate a better deal when it's my turn to make a proposal. Losing 5% value each round means I should aim for a higher initial share to compensate for the loss over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n### Assistant: {""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given that I'm losing 5% value each round, I'm aiming to get slightly more than half to compensate for the loss. I'm hoping Alice will consider this a reasonable adjustment given the circumstances and accept this offer, as it still gives her a larger share but acknowledges the impact of inflation on my portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects you, but I need a bit more security. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice has increased her offer slightly, considering the inflation, my gain is actually worth less now than in the initial round. Given that the value of the money continues to decrease for me with each round, I'm inclined to push for a better deal, hoping that Alice will further compromise or that I can propose a more favorable split in the next round. The 9.75% decrease in value means I need a higher nominal amount to compensate for the loss in value over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Assistant: {""bob_gain"": 490000, ""alice_gain"": 510000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I believe this adjustment is necessary for a fair split.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: With the money being worth 9.75% less for me now and the potential for further devaluation, I'm increasing my proposed share to try and compensate for these losses. I'm aiming to get closer to half of the original amount in real value terms, considering the cumulative effect of inflation. This offer still gives Alice more than half but acknowledges the growing disparity in value due to inflation."
