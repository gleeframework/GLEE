"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split.  We both get a good amount, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future if we need to.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice.  The inflation is getting out of control, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
