Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money. Since I'm unaware of the inflation effect on Bob, it's wise to secure a significant share early on.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation effect. It's better to secure 50% now than risk getting nothing in the end."
