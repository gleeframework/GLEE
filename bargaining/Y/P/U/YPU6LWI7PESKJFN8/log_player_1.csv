"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am proposing that I take 60% of the money ($600,000) and Bob takes 40% ($400,000). My message to Bob is ""Let's divide fairly"". I hope he accepts this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a little more this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The fact that the money is worth 20% less to me in this round means that the $400,000 Bob is offering is actually equivalent to $320,000 in the first round, which is less than I initially offered him! I think I can do better than that, so I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll propose that I take 55% of the money and Bob takes 45%. Since the money is worth 20% less to me than in the first round, and 40% less than the original value (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. My message to Bob is ""Let's find a middle ground"".
