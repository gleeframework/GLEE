"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division where I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this division is fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider this when evaluating Bob's offer. Given that Bob's offer of $45 for me is actually worth less than face value, and considering the message suggesting this is a fair split considering inflation, I will reject this offer. I believe I can propose a better division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more fair""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI've already sent my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more fair""}

I'm proposing that I receive $58 and Bob receives $42, with a message explaining that this division is more fair when considering the effects of inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
