Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take the lion's share, but I'm leaving Bob a small amount just in case he's feeling generous later on. ðŸ˜‰  It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping he'll accept the offer and we can both walk away with some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Bob is being greedy, and I know I can do better.  It's my turn to make an offer next round, and I'll be sure to make a fairer proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's a fair and reasonable offer.  Hopefully, Bob will see that we both stand to gain more if we agree to this."
