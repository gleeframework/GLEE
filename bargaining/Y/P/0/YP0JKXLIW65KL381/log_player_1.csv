 I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm still offering Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to secure a small amount, Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, and considering the inflation, it's not worth it. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more moderate offer this round.  Since Bob rejected my initial proposal, I'm decreasing my share a bit and increasing his to see if he's more open to compromise. With the inflation factor, this still gives me a decent portion of the money, while hopefully getting the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. Inflation has hit me hard, and Bob's offer is quite low.  However, I don't know how much more he'll be willing to concede, and another round will decrease the value of my share even further. I'm accepting this offer to avoid further losses."
