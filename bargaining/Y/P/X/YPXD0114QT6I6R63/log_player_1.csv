Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Bob's message: I think it's better to take a little more for myself this round, but we can still split it fairly.  Let's see what you think.

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
