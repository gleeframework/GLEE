"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. Time is money, so I think we should settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer. While I appreciate Alice's desire to be fair, the initial offer leaves me with a significantly smaller share. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid further rounds of negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair share, but time is ticking and the value is decreasing.  This offer still gives you a good amount and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer an even split, I recognize that the value of the money is decreasing for Alice, and it's better to secure a decent amount now than risk losing more in future rounds."
