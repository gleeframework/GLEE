Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the extreme devaluation of the money for you, I'm making an offer that reflects the current reality. I suggest you accept this, as further rounds will render the money nearly worthless for you.

At this point, the relentless march of inflation has significantly eroded Alice's potential gains. While Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, it's the best Alice can realistically hope for at this stage. Rejecting the offer risks even further losses, potentially leaving Alice with a pittance in the end."
