"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and can avoid unnecessary rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's see if you'll accept this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
