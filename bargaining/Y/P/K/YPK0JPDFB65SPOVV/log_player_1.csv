Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and take almost everything in the first round, hoping Bob is either naive or doesn't understand the inflation aspect.  If he rejects, I'll have to be more reasonable in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more money, I have to be realistic. Bob is clearly more aware of the inflation aspect than I initially thought.  Taking 400,000 is better than losing 90% of the money due to inflation and getting nothing in the next round."
