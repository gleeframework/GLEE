"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 550,000 for him and 450,000 for me, and the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the trend of Bob trying to gain more. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, but still tries to maintain a balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer being 620,000, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a bit shortchanged. Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, his offer is actually a significant portion of the remaining amount. I'll accept Bob's offer.
