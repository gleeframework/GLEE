"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given your initial proposal. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $40 is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, so I'll actually gain $36.

I'm not convinced by Bob's reasoning, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 81% of its original value due to inflation (90% of 90% = 81%), so I'll actually gain 81% of my desired amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and keeping 45% for myself, which is $45."
