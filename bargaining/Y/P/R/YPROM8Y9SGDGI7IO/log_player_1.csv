"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me 40% of the total, especially when I know that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a stronger proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal than my initial proposal, but still trying to keep the pressure on Bob to make a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not convinced yet.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll think carefully about this offer...

After some consideration, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me 48% of the total, especially when I know that Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'll try to make a stronger proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve the majority""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a more aggressive proposal than my previous ones. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I'm not going to give up completely 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a balance, but I'm not sure if this is the right time to accept.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll think carefully about this offer...

After some consideration, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer because it gives me a majority of the total, which is what I was aiming for in my previous offer. Additionally, it's a more balanced split than Bob's previous offers, and I think it's a fair compromise."
