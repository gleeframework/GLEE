"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm also leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer or propose a different split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a slightly more even split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45$ is actually worth 36$ (since 45 * 0.8 = 36). I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but it's a bit more even than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer for now.
