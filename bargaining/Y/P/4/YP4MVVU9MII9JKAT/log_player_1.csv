"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a smaller share for Alice, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: $20
* Bob gain: $64

I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer.
