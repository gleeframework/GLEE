"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable given that I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth $600,000, but the money Bob gains is now worth 80% of $700,000, which is $560,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of money. However, I don't want to risk losing out on a decent chunk of money, so I'll accept the offer.
