"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the initial $100. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, in my favor this time.  It's a fair trade, since you got the better end of the deal last round.   
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script, huh? I'm not so sure about this offer. I'd rather not give him the majority of the money, especially considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split for me, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust for the decreasing value of money and propose a slightly more favorable split for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
