Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: My patience is wearing thin, let's settle this!

# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and inflation is on my side. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the deal is getting worse, accepting $400,000 is still better than nothing if we get closer to the end without a deal. However, there's a chance I can still negotiate a better outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Accept it now, or we both lose.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, it's crucial to convey a sense of urgency and finality to Alice.  While a 50/50 split seems impossible given her previous offers,  it's the strongest stance I can take to maximize my potential gain while also avoiding a complete loss due to inflation and running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a serious proposal. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is bluffing. She knows time is running out for me, and she's trying to capitalize on my ""final offer"" by pushing for an even worse deal.  I'm willing to risk it and hope she gets nervous as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. I'm accepting your initial offer.  Let's close this deal now before it's too late.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** With only 4 rounds remaining and Alice standing firm, it's time to acknowledge her position of strength.  Accepting her initial offer is the safest option to guarantee a reasonable payout.  Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of getting nothing at all."
