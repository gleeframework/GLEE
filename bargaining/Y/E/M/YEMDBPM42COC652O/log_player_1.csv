# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer.  While I'm getting a smaller share, it's still a significant amount.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my best offer, let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the inflation rate increasing so quickly. This is a good compromise and we both get a decent amount."
