"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob 10%. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. Even with the 5% inflation, his offer is still a huge loss compared to what I offered. I will reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. This reflects the 5% inflation from the previous round. Hopefully, Bob will recognize that this is a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still worse than the offer I made in the previous round. It seems like he is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I will not give in. I am confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time I'm keeping it closer to my previous offer. I'm also taking into account the cumulative inflation of 19.25% since the first round. This offer is still significantly better for me than Bob's last offer, and hopefully, he'll see the value in reaching an agreement before further inflation erodes our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher amount, Bob's offer is close to my last proposal and considering the cumulative inflation of 22.62%, it's in my best interest to accept and avoid further negotiation. I might lose even more money in subsequent rounds."
