"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, as the value of the money is decreasing for you faster than for me.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up that much! With the money worth 20% less, I think I can do better than 40%. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
