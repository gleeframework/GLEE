"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a fair starting point, but I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get the same amount, and we don't have to keep playing this game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'd rather not accept an even split, since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit too optimistic about the split. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
