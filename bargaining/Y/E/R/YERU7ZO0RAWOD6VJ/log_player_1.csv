"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 70/30 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, while still keeping a decent amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

I'll have to think carefully about this one too...

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than mine, so I'm not as concerned about the exact numbers. However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best deal for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer again.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a reasonable amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you a fair share 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to meet him in the middle again!

Considering the inflation effect, the actual value of Bob's gain is much lower than mine, so I'm not as concerned about the exact numbers. And a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
