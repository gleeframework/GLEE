I'm going to start with a very strong offer for myself, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'm taking the lion's share, but leaving a small amount for Bob.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the offer is a lot better for me than last round, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.  Bob clearly wants to be greedy, but I'm not going to let him get away with it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and find a middle ground here.  While I want to get as much as possible, I'm aware that the money is losing value with each round.  This offer gives Bob a decent share while still leaving me with the majority."
