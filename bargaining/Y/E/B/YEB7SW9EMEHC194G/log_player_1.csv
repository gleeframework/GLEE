"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we're not leaving too much room for negotiations in future rounds."
