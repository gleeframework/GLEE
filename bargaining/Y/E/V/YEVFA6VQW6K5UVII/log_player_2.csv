"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, considering the inflation rate is higher for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly. This offer is good for both of us before inflation hits too hard.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation, accepting this offer now is in both our interests to maximize the remaining value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is hitting hard now, and it's better to secure a decent share of the remaining value rather than risk losing even more in the next round."
