I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  This will give me the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's not ideal, but with inflation kicking in, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best move for me at this point."
