Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share early on.  Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to get as much as possible quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, getting 50% now is better than risking getting nothing at all later due to the inflation.  It's a fair split, and I can't be sure if Bob will be more generous in the next round."
