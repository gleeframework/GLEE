Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share. Let's find a middle ground and avoid the risk of losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, the offer is still skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I need to hold out for a better deal for a few more rounds."
