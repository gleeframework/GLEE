"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain remains the same value, I'm actually gaining 4,000 dollars that's worth 4,000 dollars, but Bob is gaining 6,000 dollars that's worth 4,800 dollars. This offer seems slightly unfair to me, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain remains the same value, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the inflation that affects Bob's gain. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values Bob is offering:

Alice's gain: 3,000 dollars (no change in value)
Bob's gain: 7,000 dollars, but due to inflation, its value is 5,200 dollars (70% of the original 7,000)

This offer seems quite unfavorable to me, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain remains the same value, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the increasing inflation affecting Bob's gain. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values Bob is offering:

Alice's gain: 2,000 dollars (no change in value)
Bob's gain: 8,000 dollars, but due to inflation, its value is 3,280 dollars (41.6% of the original 8,000)

This offer seems even more unfavorable to me, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain remains the same value, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the increasing inflation affecting Bob's gain. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This is similar to my initial offer, but with a slightly more favorable split for me to account for the increasing inflation."
