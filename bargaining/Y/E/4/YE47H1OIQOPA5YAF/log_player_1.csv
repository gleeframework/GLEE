"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. If Bob's offer is to split the money equally, that means I'll get 50% of the current value of the money, which is $5000.

I'll accept this offer.
