"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. If he accepts, we can move on to the next round. If not, I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my proposal now that the money is worth 10% less.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can do better than a 50/50 split, considering the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that's more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being very generous, Bob. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I expect a better deal next time.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to maximize my share while still giving Bob a decent amount, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's split it 4500 for me, 5500 for you. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, $5,500 is actually a pretty good deal for me, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to maximize my share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being very flexible, Bob. I'm willing to take a bigger risk and go for a higher share. Meet me in the middle or I'll walk away.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each passing round.  This offer is a compromise, taking inflation into account. Let's make a deal before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. Considering the inflation, $6,000 is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I'm making the right decision.
