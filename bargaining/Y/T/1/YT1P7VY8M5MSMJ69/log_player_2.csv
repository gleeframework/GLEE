Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. I'm adjusting my offer slightly, but we need to agree soon! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and the value of her potential gains is plummeting. While her offer is closer to a more ""fair"" split from my perspective, I believe I can push for a better outcome in the next couple of rounds.  I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a very generous offer considering the time constraints and the decreasing value. Let's settle this now and avoid losing out completely.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm pushing my advantage here. Alice is feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and is more likely to accept an offer skewed in my favor. There's still a risk she'll reject it, but the potential reward of a 60/40 split outweighs the risk at this point."
