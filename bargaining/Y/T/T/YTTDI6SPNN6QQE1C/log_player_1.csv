"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I am offering you a 40% share. Let's be reasonable.""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer, considering we are at the beginning of the game and there are many rounds left. This offer shows my willingness to share the money, while also ensuring I get a slightly larger share, as I am the one making the first move. The message is brief and to the point, aiming to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe a 55/45 split is too favorable for him. The inflation effect is not significant enough at this stage to warrant such a large concession. By rejecting this offer, I am choosing to proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my offer. This is a fair split.""}\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial offer, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of my potential gain. By doing so, I am demonstrating my willingness to adapt to the changing circumstances of the game and attempting to find a mutually acceptable agreement. The message is concise, emphasizing the fairness of the proposed split."
