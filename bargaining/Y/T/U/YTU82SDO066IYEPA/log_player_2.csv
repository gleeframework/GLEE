Alice's offer:

I want to see what Alice proposes next, and I think I can get a better deal since the money is worth less to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better with this split. Let's work together to get the most out of this!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, I'm willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the money is losing value quickly, and this offer is only slightly worse than my previous proposal. It's time to secure a deal."
