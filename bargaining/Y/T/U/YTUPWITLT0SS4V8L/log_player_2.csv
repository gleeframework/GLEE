"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30. This is fair considering the risk and potential return. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the quick win, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not sure how inflation impacts Alice's decision making, so there's a chance I can get a larger share if I play it strategically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""I propose a 75/25 split in my favor.  While I acknowledge your initial offer, I believe a larger share is justified considering the risk associated with this game and the potential for further negotiation in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm suggesting a 60/40 split. I believe this offers a fair balance considering our respective positions. Let's move forward with this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Alice's offer.  Inflation is making the money worth less each round, and I need to secure a deal before it erodes too much further. While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's a better outcome than the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
