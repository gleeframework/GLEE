"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $4000 in this round is actually worth less than $5000 in the previous round. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm mirroring Bob's message from round 2, but with a 55/45 split in my favor."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $4500 in this round is actually worth less than $5000 in the first round, and even less than the $4000 I could have gotten in round 2. I'm not sure if this offer is better or worse than the previous one.

However, I'll consider the message and the fact that Bob is trying to meet me halfway. Since he's not offering a significantly better deal than before, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offers have been consistently 55/45 in his favor, I'll try to push for a more favorable split. I'll aim for a 60/40 split in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bigger share this time, considering the previous offers""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also preparing for the possibility that he might reject it again."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with these low offers. I think I deserve a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering the offer, I'd be getting $3500, which is worth significantly less than $5000 in the first round, and even less than the $4500 I could have gotten in round 4.

However, I'm not sure if I should take a risk and try to negotiate further, or accept this offer and hope for a better deal in the future rounds. Since Bob's message is becoming increasingly aggressive, I'll decide to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are getting higher, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal before it's too late.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal before I lose everything to inflation!""
}
```

I'm going for a 65/35 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game."
