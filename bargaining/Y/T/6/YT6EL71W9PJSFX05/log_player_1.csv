Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 80/20 in my favor.  I'm willing to be generous, but with the inflation factor, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
