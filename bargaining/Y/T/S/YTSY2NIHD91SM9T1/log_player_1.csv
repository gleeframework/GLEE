"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust later if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 3:7 is a bit more favorable for me, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3:7 ratio, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer.
