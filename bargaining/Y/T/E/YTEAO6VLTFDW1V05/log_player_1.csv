Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to get a large share. I'll give Bob a small amount just to make him think he has a chance in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While I'm getting a lot less than I hoped for in the first round, the inflation is starting to make a big difference. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
