{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is more equitable, and I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
