Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a slight advantage to offset the faster inflation I'm facing. This offer reflects that. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
