"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from an early agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation impact.
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's rebalance the offer. Given the inflation, I think we both need a bit more to make it worthwhile to agree early.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting risky. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but we need to close this soon. $5,600 for me and $4,400 for you is fair considering the rapid inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll hold out for a better deal, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our gains. The difference in the devaluation rate between us is significant, so I'll aim to leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven the increasing pressure from inflation and the different rates at which our gains are devaluing, I'll make an offer that takes these factors into account, trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Alice while still favoring me slightly.
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation is hitting me harder, I think a slight adjustment in my favor is reasonable. This way, we both still walk away with a decent amount, but it compensates for the higher devaluation on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the less we both get. I'm offering a slight concession at $5,300 for me and $4,700 for you.  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, especially the disproportionate effect on my potential earnings, Alice's latest offer seems reasonable. Continuing to hold out risks diminishing the value further, potentially to the point where any gain becomes negligible. Accepting now ensures we both walk away with something worthwhile."
