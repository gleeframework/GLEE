I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a 90/10 split. I figure this gives Bob a small incentive to accept, and if he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low for me. Even with the inflation, I'm still better off waiting to make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 70/30, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I rejected his last offer."
