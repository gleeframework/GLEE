400000.0,600000.0,"I think $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you is a fair deal. We both get a good amount, and it saves us from the risk of inflation.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. Let's be realistic - your offer in round 2 was heavily in your favor.  I'm proposing $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a compromise that still gives you a good chunk before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand we're both feeling the pressure of inflation. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 550,000/450,000 split.  This allows us both to get a reasonable amount before the value declines further. Let's end this game on a good note.",Bob,4,
