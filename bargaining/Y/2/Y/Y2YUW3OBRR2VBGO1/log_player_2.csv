Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. Let's be realistic - your offer in round 2 was heavily in your favor.  I'm proposing $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a compromise that still gives you a good chunk before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

This allows us both to get a reasonable amount before the value declines further. Let's end this game on a good note.""}
