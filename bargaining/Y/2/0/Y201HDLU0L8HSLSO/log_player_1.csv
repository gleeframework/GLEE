"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself, and I'm trying to convince him that it's a fair deal. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my 70$ is now worth 56$ (since it's 20% less), and Bob's 30$ is now worth 27$ (since it's 10% less).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take 50$ and Bob will take 50$. It's a fair and straightforward split, and I don't see any reason to negotiate further."
