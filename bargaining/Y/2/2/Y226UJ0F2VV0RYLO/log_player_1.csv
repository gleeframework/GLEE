"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 490,000
Bob gain: 490,000

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more money in subsequent rounds.
