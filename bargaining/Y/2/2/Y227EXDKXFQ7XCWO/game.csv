6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point. Let's see if we can agree on this.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer was a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Let's compromise. I'll take a slightly smaller share at 5200, and you get 4800. This way, we both get closer to our desired split, and we avoid further inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
