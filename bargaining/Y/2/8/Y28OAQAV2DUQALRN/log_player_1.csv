Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll take a good chunk of the money since I'm the first to propose.  I think Bob will be happy with 10% as it's better than nothing.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, taking 70% is better than nothing in the next round.  Plus, it's a good deal compared to the 10% Bob offered last round. Let's see if I can get him to budge on his offer next time!"
