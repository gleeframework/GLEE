"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a good starting point, and we can always negotiate more later! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain would be 810,000 (90% of 900,000).

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, as I'd rather have a larger share to compensate for the inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain would be 729,000 (90% of 810,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $810,000 (the value of the money after inflation) and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a solution where we both get a good share. Let's compromise a bit more and split it 40/60. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my gain would be 675,000 (90% of 750,000, which is 90% of 810,000 * 0.9).

I'm not sure I want to split it 40/60, as I'd rather have a larger share to compensate for the inflation. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer.
