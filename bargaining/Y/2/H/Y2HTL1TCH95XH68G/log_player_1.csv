"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and leaving $200,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60%. It's a decent compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth 95% of the initial $400,000, which is $380,000.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to settle for this compromise. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so my gain will be worth 95% of $380,000, which is $361,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to meet you in the middle. Take 40% and I'll take 60%.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
