Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 520000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, it's better than the last round considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to use manipulative tactics, framing his offer as generous while the actual value decreases each round.  My offer in Round 3 was the most strategically sound, considering the long-term impact of inflation. It's better to hold out for a deal that reflects the true value, even if it takes a few more rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 504030,
""bob_gain"": 495970,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sticking to a fair deal. This factors in the inflation, which hurts us both, even if it affects me more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly increasing my offer from Round 3 to show a willingness to negotiate, but not by much. This keeps me in a strong position while acknowledging the time pressure.
* **Highlighting Shared Loss:** By emphasizing that inflation negatively impacts both of us, I'm appealing to Bob's rational side and subtly countering his manipulative attempts to frame the situation. 
* **Clear Bottom Line:**  My offer is designed to maximize my gains while staying above the threshold where accepting Bob's offer in the next round would be more beneficial. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a favorable outcome before the inflation significantly erodes the value of the deal for both of us."
