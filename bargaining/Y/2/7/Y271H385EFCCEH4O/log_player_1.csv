"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a better deal, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the numbers are now:

* Alice gain: $4,000 (down from $8,000)
* Bob gain: $6,000 (down from $12,000)

I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider the offer. Since I was already at $8,000, I'd rather not go below $4,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is hitting hard! The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the numbers are now:

* Alice gain: $4,050 (down from $4,800)
* Bob gain: $5,450 (down from $6,600)

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I was already at $6,000, I'd rather not go below $4,050. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
