"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round, Bob. Take this offer, or risk getting nothing later! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'd love $1,000, it's a very small share of the total. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to take the risk of getting nothing, since there's a chance I could get much more in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  We both get a decent share this way, and we don't have to risk losing everything as the rounds go on.""
