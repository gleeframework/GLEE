"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also setting a baseline for future proposals.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, considering the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the value of money is decreasing for both of us, it's decreasing more significantly for me. Accepting this offer would mean I'm agreeing to a split that's less favorable to me, especially considering the initial proposal I made and the fact that the difference in the decrease of value between us is quite significant (20% for me vs 5% for Bob). I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a balance that accounts for the inflation impact on both sides."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've adjusted my offer. This is more than fair.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, where the value of money decreases more significantly for me than for Bob, I've adjusted my initial offer to still favor me but by less margin than initially proposed. This adjustment aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to Bob while considering the uneven impact of inflation on our gains. The message emphasizes that this is a more than fair adjustment, given the circumstances, in an attempt to persuade Bob to accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. The inflation is affecting us both, but a fairer split is crucial to avoid both of us losing out. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message emphasizes the importance of a fairer split, the proposed division doesn't adequately account for the significantly greater impact of inflation on my potential gain. At this point, the money I would gain is worth nearly 50% less than its original value, while Bob's share is only about 14% less valuable. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not adequately compensated for the disproportionate loss in value I'm experiencing. I'll continue to negotiate, seeking a division that more equitably addresses the uneven effects of inflation on our shares."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me harder. This is as fair as I can be.""}\n\nGiven the increasingly significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I've adjusted my offer again to try and find a mutually acceptable division. By proposing a split of $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, I'm attempting to balance the scales somewhat, acknowledging that the value of the money is decreasing more rapidly for me. The message emphasizes that, given the circumstances, this offer is as fair as I'm willing to be, aiming to convey that there's little room for further concessions on my part."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round. It's time to compromise.  I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to secure a deal. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's message emphasizing the need for compromise and the fact that we're both losing money, the proposed division doesn't adequately reflect the significantly greater impact of inflation on my potential gain. At this point, the money I would gain is worth over 67% less than its original value, while Bob's share is about 22.6% less valuable. Accepting this offer would mean I'm agreeing to a split that doesn't compensate me fairly for the much larger loss in value I'm experiencing. Given the substantial difference in how inflation is affecting us, I'll continue to seek a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Last reasonable offer. Inflation is killing my share.""}\n\nGiven the drastic impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth over 67% less than its original value, I'm making what I consider to be my last reasonable offer. By proposing an equal split of $50 for both of us, I'm essentially conceding that further negotiations may not yield a better outcome for me, considering the rapidly diminishing value of the money I stand to gain. The message emphasizes the urgency and the significant impact of inflation on my share, aiming to convey that this offer represents the most equitable division possible under the circumstances."
