This is a tough one! Here's my reasoning:

* **Time pressure:** We're at round 6 out of 12, and the value is diminishing rapidly.  
* **Bob's desperation:**  Bob's messages indicate increasing desperation, and he's likely to make even worse offers as the rounds progress. He even called this his final offer.
* **Decent offer:** While not ideal, getting $6000 (which is worth roughly $4700 of the original value due to inflation) is better than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. 

It's a gamble, but waiting might lead to an even worse outcome!"
