"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept the middle ground just yet. I'd like to see if Bob can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a bit more, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, Alice. But I think this is the best I can do. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a good opportunity to accept a decent offer and end the game. The inflation is making my gains less valuable, so I'd rather take what I can get now."
