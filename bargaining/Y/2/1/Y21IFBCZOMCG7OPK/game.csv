500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to go.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate a 50/50 split in principle, Bob, inflation is working against you, not me.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Okay, Bob, I'm willing to be a bit more generous. This offer gives you a significant sum, but you need to act fast before inflation eats away at it even more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer to the end. Let's be reasonable and split it 60/40. I'm willing to take a little less to avoid the risk of getting nothing.",Bob,4,
,,"You're right about getting closer to the end, Bob, but time is working in my favor, not yours. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that rate.",Alice,4,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"This is my final offer, Bob. It's still a generous cut considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,

750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, this is a significant amount of money, even with the inflation.  Let's be smart and end this here. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, time is running out. This is my best offer, and it's still significantly more than you're offering.  If we don't agree, we both get nothing. It's a risk we both need to consider.",Bob,8,
,,"You're getting desperate, Bob, and I can smell it. I'm not buying your bluffs anymore.",Alice,8,reject

100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to take the risk of getting nothing, but I'm not going lower than this. It's the only way I see us both getting anything at all.",Bob,10,
,,"Okay, Bob, you win. It's better to walk away with something than nothing.",Alice,10,accept
