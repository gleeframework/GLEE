"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can get 200k and I'll take the rest. It's a good starting point, and we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaves Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my offer, but I'll adjust my strategy accordingly.

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it as well. The inflation has already reduced the value of the money, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation and the fact that we've already had two rounds.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's aim for a 60-40 split. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much ground. Let's meet somewhere in between our previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation continuing to reduce the value of the money, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it as well. While it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, I'm still not getting as much as I'd like, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.
