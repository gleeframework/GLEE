"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob. A little more for me to start since the value decreases faster for me each round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now worse for me than my original offer in Round 1.  The money is devaluing for him, so he'll be under more pressure to make a better offer soon. I'm willing to gamble a bit to see if I can get a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is between our two previous offers.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems like a fair compromise, Alice.  We're getting close to the deadline. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer is better than my last offer, and we are getting close to the deadline.  If I reject this, Bob's offers will likely get worse as the devaluation of the money will make him increasingly desperate.  It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting a much worse outcome later."
