"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
