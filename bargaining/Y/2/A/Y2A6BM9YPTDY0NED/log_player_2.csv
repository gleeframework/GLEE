**Reasoning:**

While the offer is tempting, time is becoming critical, and Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share and am willing to risk it going down to the wire. Accepting now sets a weak precedent."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing my potential gains. While this isn't ideal, taking Alice's offer now guarantees a decent amount that's significantly better than risking it all in the remaining rounds and potentially ending up with nothing."
