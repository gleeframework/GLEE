"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, my friend, this deal is better for you in the long run. Let's not risk further inflation eating away at our potential gains!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I still think I deserve a larger share due to the higher inflation rate affecting me. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer seems to acknowledge the inflation disparity, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. The game is designed to incentivize early agreement. By round 4, the total value of the reward is diminishing significantly. I'm hoping that by holding out a bit longer, I can push Bob towards a more equitable split without risking a no-deal outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and the value is decreasing rapidly. This offer still gives you a decent share considering the inflation working against you. Don't let greed ruin our chances!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about time, but I believe a fair share considering the inflation rates should still favor me slightly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** The relentless march of inflation has taken a serious toll. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing. Further delays will only result in a smaller pot for both of us.  Bob seems insistent on a larger share, and accepting now prevents further losses due to his higher inflation rate."
