"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a gentle nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now and avoid a worse deal later! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and we can both get a decent share!""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the remaining value, and Bob gets 40%. The message is a friendly reminder that we can both do better than a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting low, take this before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With inflation taking its toll, my potential gain is worth even less now. Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not ready to give up yet.

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at the money, and my options are getting limited. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this!""
}
```

This offer gives me 42% of the remaining value, and Bob gets 58%. The message is a hint that I'm running out of patience and options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're almost out of options, take the last decent offer! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The writing is on the wall. With inflation taking its toll, my potential gain is worth a tiny fraction of the original amount. Bob's offer is the last decent one I'll get, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the $100,000.
