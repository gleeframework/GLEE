"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. It seems like we're both losing out with these uneven splits and inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go forward. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
