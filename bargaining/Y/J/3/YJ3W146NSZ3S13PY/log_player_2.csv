Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is framing her offer as a compromise, it's important to consider the decreasing value of the money. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds. The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice might become, potentially leading to a better offer for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 530000,
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer is a good balance between fairness and the shrinking pot.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only six rounds remaining, the pressure is on. Alice needs to understand that time is literally money in this scenario. 
* **Slight Concession:** This offer shows a slight willingness to negotiate by coming down from the previous 55-45 split. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** It's crucial not to appear desperate, so I'm not drastically changing my offer. The message emphasizes fairness while acknowledging the diminishing returns."
