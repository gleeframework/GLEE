Let's see if Bob thinks I'm being generous or greedy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy about the inflation, but I'm not going to settle for such a drastic reduction in my share.  Let's see if Bob will come back with a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I still want the majority share. Let's see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than half.  Even with the inflation, I can still do better than that.  I'm hoping Bob will come back to the negotiating table with a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm sticking with a 60/40 split, even with the inflation hitting hard.  It's the best I can do, and I'm hoping it's enough to get Bob to finally agree."
