"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation rate""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I've included a message to Bob, suggesting that we consider the inflation rate in our decision-making process. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'm trying to reach an agreement quickly. At the same time, I'm aware that Bob's money is only worth 5% less with each round, so I'm attempting to find a balance between our interests. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better if we split it more evenly. This way, we'll both have more to work with after inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains. While Bob's suggestion to split the money more evenly might seem reasonable, the fact that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round creates a sense of urgency to secure a larger share. I'll try to negotiate a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob 42 dollars and keeping 58 dollars for myself. I've included a message explaining that, while I'm willing to compromise, I still need a larger share due to the significant impact of inflation on my gains. By making this offer, I'm attempting to balance my need for a larger share with Bob's desire for a more even split, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money with each passing round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
