Bob rejected this offer because he wanted a larger share.
*   In Round 2, Bob offered a 55-45 split in his favor, considering the inflation. Alice rejected this offer because she wanted a larger share.
*   In Round 3, Alice offered a 52-48 split in Bob's favor, considering the inflation. Bob rejected this offer because he wanted an even larger share.
*   In Round 4, Bob offered a 60-40 split in his favor. Alice accepted this offer because she realized that the inflation would continue to decrease the value of her share if the game continued.

In this game, Alice and Bob had different perceptions of what constituted a fair split. Bob took advantage of the inflation to negotiate a better deal for himself. Alice, on the other hand, was more concerned with getting a larger share, even if it meant accepting a less favorable split.

The game demonstrates how inflation can affect negotiations and how different players may have different priorities and strategies. It also shows how the game can end with a mutually acceptable agreement, even if it's not the most favorable outcome for one of the players."
