Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Alice a slightly smaller share, hoping to secure a win for myself in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation affecting Alice makes this offer more appealing. It's a decent gain for me, and I'm not sure if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
