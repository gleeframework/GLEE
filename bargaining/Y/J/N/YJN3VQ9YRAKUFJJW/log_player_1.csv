I'm proposing to keep 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer to see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While his offer seems better at first glance, I'm not going to accept it.  Bob's offer gives me 100,000, which is actually worth less than the 900,000 I was offered in round 1 due to the 5% inflation.  The inflation will keep making his offers worse for me if we continue, so I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000 this time. I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still offering him a significant amount of money. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept the deal and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even with the significant inflation, the 200,000 is a better deal for me than what I was offered in the previous round. It's time to take what I can get!"
