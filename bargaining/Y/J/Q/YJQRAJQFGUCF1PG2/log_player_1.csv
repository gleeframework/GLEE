"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of me with a slightly unfair split! I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a counteroffer to Bob. Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```
This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
