Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  We can avoid further discounts this way. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
