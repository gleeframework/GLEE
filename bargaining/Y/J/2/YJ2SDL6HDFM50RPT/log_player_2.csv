"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""My turn.  I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. This deal won't last.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploit Time Pressure:** Alice's money is devaluing much faster than Bob's.  This offer puts significant time pressure on her to accept a deal now. 
* **Appear Generous (Initially):** Offering 70/30 might seem generous at first glance, making Alice more likely to consider it quickly.
* **The Clock is Ticking:** Even though it's only round 2, emphasizing the time sensitivity (""This deal won't last"") plays into the psychological pressure of the devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is Working in Bob's Favor:** Alice's offer is getting closer to even, but the sharp devaluation of her potential gains works strongly in Bob's favor.  He can afford to be patient.
* **Maintain Psychological Pressure:** By continuing to reject her offers, Bob reinforces the idea that time is his ally, increasing the chances of Alice panicking and accepting a less favorable deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice, and yours is disappearing.  This is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Endgame:** By round 4, Alice's gains have eroded significantly.  It's time for Bob to push for a decisive win.
* **Strategic Bluff:** Calling this a ""final offer"" creates a strong sense of urgency, even though Bob might be willing to negotiate slightly in another round.
* **Slight Concession:**  Moving from 70/30 to 65/35 gives the appearance of compromise, which might be enough to sway Alice under pressure."
