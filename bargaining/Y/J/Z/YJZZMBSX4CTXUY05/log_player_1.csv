"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\nI'll start by offering a division of $1,000,000, where I'll take 60% ($600,000) and Bob will take 40% ($400,000). My message to Bob is: ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%"". I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering I'm taking on the risk of inflation, which will decrease the value of the money with each passing round. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about a slightly better deal for me this time? Think about the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\nConsidering the inflation, my potential gain of $450,000 in this round is actually worth less than it was in the first round. However, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Since Bob's offer still doesn't meet my expectations, I will reject it. My response is: {""decision"": ""reject""}. The game will proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\nIn this round, I'll take into account the inflation and its impact on my potential gain. Since the value of the money is decreasing for me, I'll try to find a balance between getting a fair share and considering the decreasing value. My new proposal is: {""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}. I'm offering a slightly lower percentage for myself compared to the first round, but still aiming for a relatively fair division, given the circumstances.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the inflation is working against you. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 4\nWith the inflation rate increasing, my potential gain of $490,000 in this round is worth even less than in the previous rounds. However, I still need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus continuing to negotiate. Since Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50-50 split, and considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm starting to think that it might be better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. My response is: {""decision"": ""accept""}. I believe it's time to accept the offer and secure my share of the money before it loses even more value.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
