Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally""
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a significant share, but I want to keep a bit more for myself since I'm making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this offer accounts for the decreasing value of the money. It benefits us both to settle quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
