"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal than 100k.  I think I can do better, especially since the money is worth more to me than it is to Alice in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split. Let's work together to ensure we both get a good share before the value of the money decreases.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's find a solution that keeps us both in the game and prevents further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and further negotiation risks losing even more.  It's better to take a good deal now rather than risk getting nothing later."
