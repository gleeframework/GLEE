# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. This offer ensures you get a good deal now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let time run out! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is ticking, accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant chunk of the initial amount due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - a reasonable compromise that considers the time pressure. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We need to signal to Alice that we're serious about getting a deal done soon. Offering a slightly better deal than her previous while still favoring her is a good strategy. By framing it as a ""final offer,"" we might push her to accept rather than risk the deal falling through entirely due to inflation eating away at my potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but the clock is really ticking. Accepting this offer gives me 4400, which is significantly less than what I aimed for initially. However, rejecting it means risking getting even less in the following rounds as inflation eats away at the value. Alice might also be less willing to negotiate further, knowing that I'm under pressure. It's a gamble I'm not willing to take at this point."
