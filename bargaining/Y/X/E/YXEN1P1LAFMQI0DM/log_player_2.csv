"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I get $60, you get $40. It's a good offer for you in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nNext, I'll make a proposal for division in Round 2:\n\nBob's offer: I get $55, Alice gets $45.\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision on this offer. Keep in mind that the money's value decreases with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, so I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $55, and you get $45.  It's better than what you'll get if you wait longer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Alice's offer of $45 for me and $55 for her. Given the decreasing value of money with each round, it seems like a reasonable compromise, and further negotiations might lead to even less valuable outcomes for both of us."
