"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. I believe this offers a fair distribution considering the potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 75/25 split is tempting, I don't know how inflation is affecting Alice.  It's possible she's getting a much bigger advantage from the inflation than I am.  I'll reject and see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 90/10 split.  It's a good deal for me, but I'm willing to share some of the gains to avoid further rounds of negotiation.""}
