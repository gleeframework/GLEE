Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, still quite fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Time Advantage:** Time is on my side.  Alice's money is devaluing, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds.
* **Previous Offer:** Alice is already moving closer to a more even split after rejecting my previous offer. 

I'm hoping to secure a slightly better deal in the next round.
