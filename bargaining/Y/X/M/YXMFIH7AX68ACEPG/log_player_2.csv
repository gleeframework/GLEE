"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the value of money doesn't decrease for me (Bob) but does decrease for Alice, I can potentially get a better deal if I reject this offer and propose a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll propose a slightly uneven split, taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Alice in each subsequent round.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer was based on inflation, but I'm willing to go up to 60 for myself. This is a better deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject this offer because Alice's proposed split is the opposite of what I offered in the previous round, and given the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money's value hasn't changed for me but has significantly decreased for Alice, I'll propose a split that reflects this, trying to find a balance that Alice might accept given her decreasing value per round.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation on your end, I believe this is a more reasonable split as we progress.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid further rounds of inflation, but I can't go lower than this. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I will reject this offer because, despite Alice's claim that it's her final offer, the split she proposes is still significantly in her favor, especially considering the substantial decrease in value she's facing due to inflation. Given that the value of money remains constant for me, I see no reason to accept a deal that benefits her more, especially after she rejected my previous, more balanced offers.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the significant decrease in value for Alice and her previous offers, I'll make a proposal that acknowledges her losses but also reflects the fact that the value hasn't changed for me. I'll slightly adjust my previous offer to show willingness to compromise but remain firm in seeking a better deal for myself.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial impact of inflation on your gains, I believe this split is more than fair at this point.""}"
