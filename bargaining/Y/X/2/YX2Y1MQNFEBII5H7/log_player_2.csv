"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and consider the inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is relatively fair considering the inflation, it's in my best interest to try and get a better deal. I can potentially negotiate a higher percentage for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you a bit less, but let's see if we can reach a deal before the inflation eats away at our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to continue negotiating, it's becoming riskier with the increasing inflation. This offer is closer to my desired split and ensures I get something rather than risk getting nothing."
