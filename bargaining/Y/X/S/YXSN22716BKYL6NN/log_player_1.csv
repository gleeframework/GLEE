"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I have an advantage in waiting. However, proposing a fair offer early might encourage Bob to accept, considering the value of money decreases for him with each round. This initial offer tests Bob's willingness to negotiate while also considering the impact of inflation on his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases for me each round. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for himself is not acceptable to me at this stage. Given that the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I have a strategic advantage in waiting. Bob's eagerness to find a compromise suggests he is aware of the pressure the inflation mechanic puts on him. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer that could potentially favor me more, considering Bob's decreasing bargaining power due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering your concern about inflation, I'm willing to adjust, but I still believe I deserve a slightly larger share.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my proposed gain to $5500, while offering Bob $4500. This adjustment acknowledges Bob's concerns about the decreasing value of money due to inflation but still leverages my advantage in the game. By not drastically changing the offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I recognize my stronger position in the game. This strategy aims to pressure Bob into accepting a deal that is slightly less favorable to him with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. We both lose with every round. I propose a 50/50 split to ensure we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's attempt to appeal to the mutual benefit of ending the game quickly, I've decided to reject his offer of a 50/50 split. Given that the money's value doesn't decrease for me, I don't share the same urgency as Bob, who faces a 27.1% decrease in value compared to the first round. Accepting a 50/50 split now would mean I'm not fully leveraging my strategic advantage. By rejecting this offer, I aim to further pressure Bob into accepting a less favorable deal in the next round, maximizing my potential gain."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I see you're eager to settle, but I believe my patience should be rewarded.""}\n\nIn this round, I've increased my proposed gain to $5800, while offering Bob $4200. Given Bob's previous offer of a 50/50 split and his evident concern about the decreasing value of money, I'm pushing my advantage further. By incrementally increasing my share, I'm testing Bob's willingness to compromise and accept a less favorable deal, considering the significant impact of inflation on his potential gains. This strategy aims to maximize my benefit while still keeping the offer reasonable enough for Bob to consider, given the looming deadline and the consequences of not reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer of $5300 for me and $4700 for himself, presented as his final offer, is still not enticing enough for me to accept. Given that I've been increasing my proposed share in previous rounds and Bob's gains are now worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I believe I can push for a better deal. Bob's assertive message suggests he's trying to bluff, but considering the game's mechanics and the significant impact of inflation on his gains, I think he's more desperate for a deal than I am. I'll reject this offer, hoping to force Bob into a more favorable agreement in the next round or risk him walking away, which would be disadvantageous for both but more so for him due to the inflation penalty.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given your 'final offer' was not final, I'll stick with my initial fair proposal. Consider the decreasing value of your share.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to revert to my initial offer of $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. Given that Bob presented his previous offer as ""final"" but is still participating, I believe he's more willing to negotiate than he lets on. The impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains continues to increase, now at 40.95% less than the first round, which strengthens my bargaining position. By sticking with my initial offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm not budging much from what I consider a fair division, considering the game's mechanics. This approach aims to either force Bob into accepting this deal or risk further decreases in value, which would disadvantage him significantly."
