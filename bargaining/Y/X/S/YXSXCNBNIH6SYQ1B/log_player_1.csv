"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in this round, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to meet in the middle just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer will be slightly more aggressive this time around.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a fair split, Alice. This is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more reasonable now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's getting late in the game. I'll accept Bob's offer and we can finally divide the money!"
