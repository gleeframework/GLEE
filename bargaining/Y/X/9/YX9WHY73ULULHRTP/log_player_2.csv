""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This time I'm proposing a more balanced split: 65% for me and 35% for you. Consider the inflation working against both of us, especially you in the next round.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you taking inflation into account, Bob. However, I'm willing to go down to 45% for me, but I need at least that to make it worth my while. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000
