Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both lose out if this goes any further. Let's be reasonable. I'm accepting a smaller gain than my original offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful to accept this offer, as it's the same as Round 1. However, the inflation is hurting me more than Alice.  If I reject this, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in the remaining rounds, especially if Alice keeps pushing for a larger share.
