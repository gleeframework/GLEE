"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I think I can do better than that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to settle for $4,000 when I know the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the total value of the money is now $8,000 for me and $9,000 for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is a fair split, considering the inflation we've both experienced. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The game continues!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the idea of taking $4,500. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's just get this over with and split the money!"
