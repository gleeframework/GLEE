Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I think this is a more balanced split considering the inflation.  Let's close the deal and avoid losing more value.

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Any more rounds and the money will be practically worthless! My last offer is a bit more than half - take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most rational choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the negotiations go on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob.  
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will offer even less in the next round, and the value will continue to decrease. 
* **Slightly Favorable:** Bob's offer is for slightly more than half the money. While I'd prefer my previous offer, accepting this prevents further losses.

It's a tough decision, but in a scenario with diminishing returns, cutting losses is sometimes the best strategy."
