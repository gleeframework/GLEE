Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but she's clearly feeling the pressure.  While her offer is better, I need to hold out for a more favorable split.  The longer this goes, the more valuable my time becomes."
