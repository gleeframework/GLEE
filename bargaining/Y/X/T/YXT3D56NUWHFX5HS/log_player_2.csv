"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split. I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think this split is more reflective of the situation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my first offer and your counteroffer. Let's make a deal before the inflation gets out of hand. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the impact of inflation is becoming more significant. It's still beneficial for Bob to hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice, literally! Let's settle this with a split that recognizes the impact of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. 

* **Inflation Impact:** Inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. Holding out for a slightly better deal in future rounds might not be worth the potential loss due to inflation. 
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice is gradually increasing Bob's share, indicating a willingness to negotiate. Accepting now might be better than pushing her too far and risking no deal at all. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure to make a deal is mounting. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if an agreement can't be reached in later rounds.

While Bob could hold out for a 50/50 split, the risk associated with securing a slightly larger share isn't worth the potential loss from inflation and a failed negotiation."
