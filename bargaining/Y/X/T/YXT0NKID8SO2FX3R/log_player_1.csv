"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, emphasizing the fairness of the split. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation rate. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'm effectively being offered $405,000 in ""real"" value, considering the initial value in Round 1. Given that Bob is not affected by inflation, his offer doesn't account for my loss. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground that accounts for the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle to account for my losses. This way, we both walk away with something, and it's as fair as it can get given the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 50/50 split, which might seem generous given that I previously rejected Bob's offer that gave me less. However, considering the inflation, the $500,000 I'm proposing for myself is effectively worth $450,000 in ""real"" value from Round 1's perspective. This offer aims to find a balance, acknowledging the impact of inflation on my potential gain while still being fair to Bob, who doesn't suffer from this inflationary effect. It's a compromise that might persuade Bob to accept, ending the game on a relatively equitable note."
