"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this time, but I'm willing to negotiate in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's better for me than the previous one, considering the inflation.
