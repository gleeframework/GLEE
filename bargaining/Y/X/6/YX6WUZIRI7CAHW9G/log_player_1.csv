"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to set a baseline for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a little more this round, but we can still split it fairly. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob, but still trying to keep a bit more for myself."
