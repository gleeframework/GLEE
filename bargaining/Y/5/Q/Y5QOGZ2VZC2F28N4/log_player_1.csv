"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, but I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to see how he reacts, while keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm thinking a more even split is fair. Let's work towards that. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain of 45 is actually $45 * 0.9 = $40.50.

I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see a slightly more even split. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
