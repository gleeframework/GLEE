"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering I'll be taking the risk of losing some of the money in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You took a risk, now it's my turn to take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a better deal, it's clear that Alice is willing to push for more.  The inflation means I'm losing value with each round, so accepting is the best option."
