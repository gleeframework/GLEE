Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Here's why I reject:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on my side. With each round, Alice's potential gains are worth less.  
* **Holding Strong:** My previous offer was already a compromise. Accepting less than 45 now would be rewarding her dwindling position. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation.  She may be more desperate to make a deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's split it right down the middle. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline Pressure:**  Alice is now feeling significant inflation pressure. She's lost nearly 20% of her potential gains from the first round. 
* **Fairness Anchor:** By offering a 50/50 split, I establish a strong position of fairness. It's harder for her to argue against an even split, especially when time is working against her.
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I might be able to push for a slightly better deal, there's always the risk Alice will reject it.  This late in the game, securing a guaranteed 50 is better than gambling on getting a little more."
