"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money (9000$), while still offering Bob a small share (1000$).  This seems like a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal, giving him a significantly larger share.  While the inflation might have made Bob's offer more appealing to him,  it's still not a good deal for me, and there are many more rounds to play.  I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm reducing my share to 7000$, but I'm still offering Bob a significant portion of the money (3000$). I'm hoping this is a more appealing compromise and will avoid a complete reversal of roles like in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very skewed in his favor, and even though the inflation has impacted both of our gains, I'm still better off waiting. I believe I can negotiate a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This offer is a 50/50 split.  While inflation has taken its toll, I believe a fair split is the best way to ensure both of us get a reasonable amount and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
