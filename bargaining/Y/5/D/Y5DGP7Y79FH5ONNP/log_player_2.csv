Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation disparity, but that's a bit too skewed. How about a more balanced split?""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious about the inflation issue.  Let's settle this now with my original offer.

It's getting too risky now.  While not ideal, taking the 4000 (which is significantly less valuable due to inflation) is better than risking getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement."
