I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping that he'll accept it quickly and we can both get a good share of the money.  I know we have a lot of rounds left, but I don't want to risk the value of the money decreasing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. With inflation, the value of the money I'm getting is dropping significantly. I think it's better to secure 6000 now than risk getting nothing later."
