"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer aims for a fair division considering the decreasing value of money over rounds. Please consider it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is fair at the moment, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal. The money loses value more quickly for Alice, so she might be willing to give up more to avoid reaching the end with nothing."
