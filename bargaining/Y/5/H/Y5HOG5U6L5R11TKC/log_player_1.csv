"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nHow is that? I made an offer that is slightly in my favor, but still gives Bob a good amount. I also added a friendly message to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because I believe in a truly fair split. Let's go for 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I decided to reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I will actually be getting less value than Bob, even though the nominal amount is the same. I think I can make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more. Let's compromise!""}\n\n###\n\nHow is that? I increased my share to account for the inflation, but still left a significant amount for Bob. I also added a message explaining my reasoning and encouraging him to accept the compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation affects you, so I'm willing to compromise slightly. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I decided to reject Bob's offer because, even though he has made a slight concession, the offer does not fully account for the 27.1% decrease in value I'm experiencing due to inflation. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, I need a bigger share to make up for it. Let's settle this!""}\n\n###\n\nHow is that? I increased my share again to account for the growing effect of inflation, which is now 27.1% less valuable for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency in settling the deal before the inflation gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time!  I'm increasing my offer again to show I'm serious about finding a compromise. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away even more. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite his increased offer, the value I would receive is still significantly impacted by the 40.95% decrease due to inflation. At this point, accepting 5200 would actually be worth less to me than the initial 5500 I offered in the first round. I think it's worth trying to negotiate one more time to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, Bob's message seems to be trying to create a sense of urgency, but I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate. I'm not ready to give in yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is getting out of hand! I need a bigger share to make this deal worthwhile. This is my best offer yet!""}\n\n###\n\nHow is that? I increased my share significantly to account for the drastic 40.95% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm trying to make a serious deal and that we're running out of time. I've also added a message to convey the urgency of the situation and to make it clear that this is my best offer yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  You're running out of time, and inflation is only getting worse for you.  This is the best you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim that this is his final offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The value I would receive is now 52.17% less than the initial amount, which means accepting 5100 would be worth even less to me than before. I'm not convinced that Bob won't make another concession if I push for it. Additionally, Bob's message comes across as somewhat aggressive, which makes me less inclined to accept his offer. I'll try to make another proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nIt's worth noting that Bob's message saying ""this is my final offer"" is a common negotiating tactic, but it doesn't necessarily mean he won't make another offer if I reject this one. I'll call his bluff and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm not bluffing, I need this amount to make up for the inflation. This is my final offer. Take it or we both get nothing!""}\n\n###\n\nHow is that? I increased my share significantly to account for the drastic 52.17% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm not willing to compromise further and that this is my final offer. I've also added a message to convey the urgency of the situation and to make it clear that I'm not bluffing. If Bob rejects this offer, we both risk getting nothing, which would be a worse outcome for both of us. I'm counting on Bob being rational and accepting this offer.\n\n###\n\nIt's a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but I think it's worth a shot. Let's see what Bob does next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, you've proven you're willing to play hardball. Let's split the difference - my last offer, take it before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5050 
# Bob gain: 4950 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I decided to accept Bob's offer because, at this point, the value I would receive is still significantly impacted by the 61.26% decrease due to inflation. However, considering that we're running out of rounds and the risk of getting nothing is becoming increasingly real, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than trying to negotiate further. Splitting the difference between our last offers seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept this deal to ensure I get something rather than nothing.\n\n###\n\nIt's worth noting that, in hindsight, I might have been too aggressive in my previous offers, which led to Bob rejecting them. However, I'm glad we were able to find a compromise in the end, and I'm willing to accept this offer to move forward."
