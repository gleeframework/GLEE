Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I need a larger share to account for the rapid inflation affecting my gains. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer from round 3. Although she claims it's her final offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains. I'll try to make a counteroffer that addresses both our concerns about the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\nRound 4\n\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust our expectations and find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\nI've made a counteroffer, taking into account the effects of inflation and trying to find a compromise that could satisfy both of us.
