{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Bob is becoming increasingly greedy, and even with the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to stick with my strategy of offering him a larger share in the hopes that he will realize it's better to accept something than nothing."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, but I'm still going to reject it. The inflation is a major factor, and I'm hoping he realizes that a deal is better than nothing, especially since we're running out of time."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This is a risky move. I'm lowering my offer again but I think it's time to start compromising. With only 6 rounds left, the inflation is becoming a real threat.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of a deal and accept this offer before it's too late."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting, I'm still going to reject this offer. Bob is taking advantage of the situation, and I'm not convinced I can't get a better deal. I'll continue to try and negotiate, but I need to be more strategic about my offers to ensure I get a fair share of the money."

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable, and I'm not willing to accept it. The inflation is very high now, but I still have a chance to secure a better deal. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to be more careful with my offers. With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a way to make a deal that's acceptable to both of us."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The situation is dire, and we are running out of time.  I'm making a final desperate attempt to secure a deal. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the most equitable solution given the circumstances.  With only two rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will finally understand the value of a compromise before the inflation makes this deal worthless for both of us."
