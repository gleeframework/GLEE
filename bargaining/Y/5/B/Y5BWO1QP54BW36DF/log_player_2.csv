Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects a fairer starting point for negotiation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's avoid going back and forth and just get this done! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not in my best interest. While she's facing inflation, accepting a deal where I get less than half the pot is not a winning strategy. I need to push for a more favorable split."
