"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  We both get the same amount, and we can avoid any more rounds and the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'd like to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, and I rejected it, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll propose a slightly larger share for myself, but still a reasonable offer.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm also worried about losing more money to inflation.  Let's split it closer to even, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly due to inflation! I'd like to get a bit more, but Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""message"": ""Alright, let's take it! I'm glad we could come to an agreement before things get worse.""
