"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth only 80% of its original value, which is $4,000. Bob's gain of $5,000 is still worth $5,000.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, taking 70% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

My gain of $4,000 is worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $2,048. I'll have to consider this when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer, as I'm not sure I can do better in the next round.
