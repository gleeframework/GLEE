"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is fair on the surface, it's important to consider the potential for negotiation and the impact of inflation. By rejecting, Bob sets the stage for him to make a proposal in the next round, potentially getting a better deal for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a slight shift in our favor is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what you think.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's call it a draw. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Although the money is worth 9.75% less for Bob, accepting this offer is still better than risking further inflation in the next round. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the future, and the money will continue to devalue.
* **Equal Split:** This offer provides an equal split, which is a fair outcome. It avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 12 rounds, it's important to secure a deal, especially as the value of the money decreases with each passing round."
