"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, you get nothing. Don't bother responding, it's not like you have a choice.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is quite reasonable.

I accept his offer.
