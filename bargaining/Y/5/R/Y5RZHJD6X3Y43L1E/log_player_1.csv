"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
I'm offering you $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, considering the initial amount is $1,000,000!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new values, my $300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's $700,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about it... and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
