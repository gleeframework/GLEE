```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair start!""
}

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of 3000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but it's still a decent offer. I'll decide to...
