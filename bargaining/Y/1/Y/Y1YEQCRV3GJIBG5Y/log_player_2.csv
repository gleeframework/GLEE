Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn to make a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

I'm offering Alice a relatively small share, but I'm hoping she'll accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Alice is offering me a slightly larger share than before, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
