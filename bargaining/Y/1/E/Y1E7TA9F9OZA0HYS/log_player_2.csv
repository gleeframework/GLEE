Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's consider the time value of money. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the loss. This 58-42 split is still a good deal for you, Bob!
