"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm starting with a relatively small amount for myself to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if you like this offer! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $80 x 0.8 = $64
* Bob gain: $20 x 0.8 = $16

Now, considering Bob's new offer, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $50
* Bob gain: $50

I'll think for a moment... I'd rather not give Bob 50% of the remaining money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the second round, the actual amount is $80 (100 x 0.8 x 0.8 = 64 x 1.25).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm trying to get a bit more for myself while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, and then another 20% less after the second round, the actual amount is $80 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $51.2.

Now, considering Bob's new offer, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $40
* Bob gain: $60

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's even more skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the original $100, the actual amount is $100 x 0.516 = $51.6.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up control!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $45 and Bob gets $55. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping some power in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'm willing to share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, 20% less after the second round, and then another 20% less after the third round, the actual amount is $100 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $40.96.

Now, considering Bob's new offer, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $30
* Bob gain: $70

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's extremely skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 67.23% less than the original $100, the actual amount is $100 x 0.332 = $33.2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I want a small share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $25 and Bob gets $75. I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point and give Bob the majority of the remaining amount."
