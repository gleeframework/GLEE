"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can do better. The ratio is 4:6, which is not favorable to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the ratio, still fair but with a bit more for me""
}
```

I'm adjusting the ratio to 55:45 in my favor, but still keeping it relatively close to the original 50/50 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the best I can do. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less, so I need to be even more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as the ratio is 45:55, which is still not favorable to me. I think I can do better, especially considering the significant inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm pushing for a better ratio, but willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting the ratio to 60:40 in my favor, trying to get a better deal considering the continued inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit tired of negotiating, but I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the money is worth much less, and I need to be very careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as the ratio is 58:42, which is closer to the original 50/50 split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money's value decreasing further."
