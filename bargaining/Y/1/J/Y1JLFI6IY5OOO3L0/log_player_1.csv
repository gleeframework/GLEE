"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start negotiating!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more considering my skills 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting 4000 dollars, which is equivalent to 5000 dollars in the original amount. However, considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give away too much more than I already have."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering my skills, and I'm willing to give you a small bonus 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the offer, I'm getting 3000 dollars, which is equivalent to 6250 dollars in the original amount. However, Bob's gain is 7000 dollars, which is equivalent to 8400 dollars in the original amount. This seems like a very uneven split, and I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think we should split it closer to 60/40""
