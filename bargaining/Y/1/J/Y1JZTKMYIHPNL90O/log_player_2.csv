"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my gains. While the offer is fair, I know the money will be worth less in the next round, so I'll try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the potential inflation. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation is affecting me more. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, this offer is still better than the original offer after inflation.  I'm willing to compromise for a quicker resolution."
