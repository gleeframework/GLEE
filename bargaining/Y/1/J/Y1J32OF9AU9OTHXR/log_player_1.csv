"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $900,000 in the first round is now worth $810,000.

As for Bob's offer, I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the best option for me. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about I get 700000 and you get 300000?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the $810,000 I would have gotten from my initial offer is now worth $729,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
