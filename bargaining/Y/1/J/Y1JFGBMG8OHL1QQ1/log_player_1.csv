"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be fair - I'm proposing a slight majority for me this round, considering the inflation. We can both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
