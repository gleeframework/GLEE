55.0,45.0,"Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing with each round. My last offer was more than fair. I'm willing to compromise at $55 for me and $45 for you. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your point about time running out, but I still think we can do better.  I'm willing to give you $45, but I need at least $55 for it to be worthwhile for me. Let's find a middle ground.",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the less we both get. I propose a simple even split: $50 for me, $50 for you.  Take this offer and let's end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further.",Alice,5,
