"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small amount, but it's better than nothing. I hope he accepts it.  I'm trying to secure most of the money for myself in the first round, knowing that inflation will work against me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is terrible for me, and it's likely Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to try and get the majority. I'll reject this and see if he's willing to be more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still aiming for the majority. Since I rejected his offer last round, I hope this demonstrates I'm willing to compromise while still looking out for myself.  Inflation will keep working against me, so I need to secure a decent portion of the money now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I have to accept this offer. With each round passing, the value of my share is dropping dramatically due to inflation. While it's not ideal, getting 100,000 is better than seeing my share shrink further in the next round. This is a tough situation, but I have to make the most of what's left."
