"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets $0. This is a bold move, but it's a good starting point. If Bob accepts, the game is over. If he rejects, I'll have to make a new proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. How about a fairer split? 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful. But a 10-90 split is a good starting point. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a good start, but I'd like to negotiate further. I'm thinking of getting at least half.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm hinting that I'd like to get at least half of the remaining money, which is $90."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, it's now worth 80% of its original value. I'll take this into account in my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 40-60 split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a decent share as well. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With Bob's offer, he's getting a larger share than before, but I'm still getting a decent amount. However, I think I can do better.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more than 30. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting that he meet me in the middle, which would be a 50-50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate continuing to rise, the money is worth even less now. I'll take this into account in my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a decent share too. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35-65 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offers. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
