"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount. I'll keep the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $100,000 in the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $90,000. However, in this round, I would gain $100,000, which is worth 90% of its original value, or $90,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer, since it's a fair split and I'm getting a better deal than in the first round.
