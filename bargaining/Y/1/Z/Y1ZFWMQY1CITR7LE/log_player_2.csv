"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  We can work out a better deal later, but this is a good starting point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but this is a much fairer split. Time is money, but so is getting a good deal. Let's avoid getting greedy and making it to the final rounds where we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiations heavily in her favor. While the offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to aim for a more equitable split, especially knowing the inflation hurts her less than me."
