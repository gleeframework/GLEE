"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can see how the game goes from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm willing to take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 80% of 5000, which is 4000. I'm not sure how much Bob's gain is worth, but I'll consider his offer.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as I'd like, considering the inflation. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth 64% of the original value (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"
