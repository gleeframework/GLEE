# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. On one hand, Bob is offering me a bigger share than before, which is good. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I should trust Bob's offer and risk getting a smaller share in the future.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new one.

# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Wow, the value of the money has decreased significantly! Despite that, Bob's offer is still a significant improvement from his previous one. I'm tempted to accept this offer, especially since Bob is offering me a bigger share than before.

However, I'm not sure if I should trust Bob's offer and risk getting a smaller share in the future. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word.
