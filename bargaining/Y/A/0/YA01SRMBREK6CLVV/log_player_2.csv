"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for us both to settle quickly. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's find a middle ground. This offer still gives you a significant advantage, and we both lose less to inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground. However, we need to factor in the higher rate of inflation you face. This offer is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using my higher inflation rate against me, trying to make me feel like her offer is generous. However, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm and show her I'm willing to risk it for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair split.  This is my final offer before the impact of inflation makes things significantly worse for both of us. Let's close this deal now.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Resolve:** Alice needs to understand I'm not going to simply accept an unfavorable deal due to inflation pressure. 
* **Slight Concession:**  By slightly increasing my initial offer, I signal a willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on a more balanced split.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Mentioning the worsening impact of inflation adds urgency for Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer is a fair 60/40 split, considering the time pressure and the inflation working against us both. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice has made a significant concession and is now offering a 60/40 split.  Considering:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round. Waiting longer will only hurt both of us.
* **Time Pressure:** We're already at round 5, with only 7 rounds remaining. 
* **Fairness:** While not ideal, 40% is a reasonable amount considering the circumstances. 

It's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting nothing in the end."
