"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take 80%""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob will get 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even. I'll take 55%, you take 45%.  This way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering the offer, I'll have to reject it, since I'd be getting a smaller share than I initially offered, which was 80%. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% and take 60%, let's compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. This is a better deal for both of us than the last few rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the offer, I'll have to reject it. I was hoping to get a higher share, especially since the money is worth less for me than for Bob. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money losing value at an alarming rate, I'll have to be even more cautious with my offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share of the original value, I'll aim for a higher percentage to make up for it.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30% and take 70%, it's my best offer so far""
}
```"
