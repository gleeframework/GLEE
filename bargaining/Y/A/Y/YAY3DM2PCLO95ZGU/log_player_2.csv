"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the impact of inflation heavily favors me (Bob) in later rounds.  Here's why:

* **My Inflation:** My share loses only 10% value each round. This means even if I get a slightly smaller share later, the overall impact on the real value I receive might be better.
* **Alice's Inflation:** Her share loses a whopping 20% each round! This puts pressure on her to secure a deal sooner rather than later.

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aware of the inflation dynamic and am willing to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic about the inflation. This offer gives you a good amount now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've increased my offer to Alice, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Inflation:**  My message directly points out the inflation disadvantage Alice faces. This reinforces the urgency for her to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While this offer is better for me, it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counters.  It's important to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring an agreement is reached before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is trying to meet in the middle. However, the deal still favors her significantly considering the rapid devaluation of her potential earnings. It's time to stand firm and highlight the increasingly negative impact inflation has on her position. Each round that passes without a deal benefits me more than her."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This is a very reasonable offer considering your share loses value much faster than mine.  Let's be smart and close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But Still Advantageous:** I've increased my offer again, demonstrating flexibility. However, this offer remains strategically in my favor due to the inflation difference.
* **Urgency and Logic:** My message emphasizes the time pressure and reminds Alice that her potential gain diminishes significantly with each passing round. 
* **Final Push for Agreement:**  We are approaching the halfway point, and reaching a deal soon is crucial. This offer represents a strong position, and further delays will only benefit me more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is finally acknowledging the need for a smaller share, her offer is still not reflective of the rapidly shifting balance in our positions. Her share has lost almost 60% of its initial value! Holding firm now is crucial to securing a deal that reflects the true impact of inflation. I need to signal that my previous offer was genuinely reasonable and further concessions on my part are unlikely."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a deal that's more than fair considering the circumstances. This is my final offer.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase, Final Offer:** I've made a minimal increase to show some flexibility but framed it as my last offer. This creates a sense of urgency and signals that further haggling is unlikely to be productive. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** While the offer favors me, it's important to frame it as a reasonable compromise given the time pressure and significant devaluation of Alice's potential share.  
* **Push for Resolution:** We're past the halfway point, and the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly for both of us. This offer, combined with the ""final offer"" stance, aims to push Alice towards a deal before it's too late."
