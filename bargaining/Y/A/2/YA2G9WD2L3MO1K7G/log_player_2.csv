Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. Let's compromise and go for a 50/50 split.  This ensures both of us receive a fair share, despite the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
