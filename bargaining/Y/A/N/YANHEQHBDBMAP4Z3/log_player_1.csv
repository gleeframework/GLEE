I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering I am taking on the initial risk of proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose a 85/15 split, with me receiving $850,000 and Bob receiving $150,000. This offer is slightly more balanced than my previous proposal, reflecting the risk of rejection and the decreasing value of the money. I believe it's a fair compromise."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose a 80/20 split. This offer reflects the continued decrease in the value of the money, and the increasing risk of not reaching an agreement. While it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, I believe it's a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still a significant drop from my initial proposal.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I propose a 75/25 split. This offer reflects the continued decrease in the value of the money and the increasing risk of reaching a stalemate.  I believe this is the last offer I can make that still feels fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I am disappointed in the decreasing value of the money, this offer is a fair 50/50 split.  I accept to avoid the risk of further inflation and potential deadlock."
