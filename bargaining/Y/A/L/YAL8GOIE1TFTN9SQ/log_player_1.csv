I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I'm aiming for a large share initially, knowing that inflation will hurt me more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my own gain by $1,000, but increasing Bob's share by $1,000 to try and incentivize him to accept.  I'm still aiming for a larger share, but acknowledging that I need to be more reasonable with inflation working against me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting a much smaller share than I initially wanted, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money I would gain.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer than risk losing even more in the next round."
