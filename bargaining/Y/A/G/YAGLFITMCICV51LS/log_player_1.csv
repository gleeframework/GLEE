"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% of the original $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

My gain: 40% of $100, which is $40, is now worth 80% of its original value due to inflation, so it's actually worth $32.
Bob's gain: 60% of $100, which is $60, remains the same.

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (20% less than in round 2). Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing that I get 30% of the original $100, which is worth $30 in real value, and Bob gets 70% of the original $100, which is worth $70 in real value."
