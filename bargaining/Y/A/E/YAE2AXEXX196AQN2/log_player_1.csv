"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to try to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to meet Bob in the middle, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the numbers slightly to see if Bob will accept this more moderate offer."
