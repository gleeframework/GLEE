"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that's still 20% less than the initial 50/50 split. Bob's offer is not generous enough, considering the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a better deal to make up for inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll think carefully about this new offer.

With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively small share for me, but it's an improvement from the previous rounds.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that the game will end soon and I can get some money, even if it's not as much as I initially hoped.
