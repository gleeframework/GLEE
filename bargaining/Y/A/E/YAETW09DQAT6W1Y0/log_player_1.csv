"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts for me would be:

* My gain: $5000 / 0.8 = $6250 (since my gain is worth 20% less)
* Bob's gain: $5000 / 0.9 = $5555.56 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less)

I'll accept Bob's offer.
