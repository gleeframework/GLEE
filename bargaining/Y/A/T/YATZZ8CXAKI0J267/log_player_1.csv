Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small share, but mostly benefits me.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer my initial offer, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome, especially considering the inflation factor. Accepting ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
