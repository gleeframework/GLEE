"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5120,
""alice_gain"": 4880,
""message"": ""Your turn! I'm feeling generous, how about a slightly better deal for you than last time?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money decreases rapidly for Bob. It's crucial to secure a deal quickly.
* **Slight Advantage:** Offering slightly more than Alice did (4880 vs 4000) might be tempting enough for her to accept, considering the time pressure on Bob.
* **Future Leverage:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is still in a relatively strong position for future rounds as he proposed a split close to even."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob! You're losing value each round. Take this deal before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:**  Alice is taking advantage of Bob's situation but the offer is still significantly worse than an even split. 
* **Calling the Bluff:**  Alice might be trying to scare Bob into taking a bad deal. By rejecting, Bob shows he's serious about getting a fairer share.
* **Shifting Power:** Each round that Bob rejects, the power dynamic shifts slightly in his favor. Alice may be more willing to negotiate in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer: a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  Offering an even split is fair and shows Bob is serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Time Pressure:**  By calling it his ""final offer"", Bob adds time pressure on Alice. She knows he's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a risk Alice will reject, but the potential reward of a 50/50 split is worth the gamble. It's better than continuing to lose value in a protracted negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. My patience is wearing thin, take this deal! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploitation:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit Bob's time pressure, and this offer is even worse than before. 
* **Maintaining Credibility:** While Bob did say the last round was his ""final offer,"" accepting this would make him look weak and desperate.
* **Potential for Better:** There's still a chance Alice will come around to a fairer deal, especially as she also loses if the game continues too long. Bob needs to hold his ground."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be a two-way street. This is my bottom line.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Bob is signaling that he's willing to move from the even split, but not drastically. This keeps him in the game while showing a degree of flexibility.
* **Firm Language:**  Using phrases like ""realistic"" and ""bottom line"" convey seriousness and urgency without seeming overly aggressive.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Bob needs to get Alice to take him seriously soon.  Every round that passes diminishes his potential winnings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not seeing much compromise from you, Bob. The value of your share keeps dropping. Take this and run! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** This offer is getting worse, not better! Alice is clearly trying to wear Bob down, but accepting would mean a significant loss compared to even his previous offers.
* **Time Pressure Shifting:** While Bob is feeling the pressure, Alice also loses if they reach round 12 without an agreement. Her attempts to bluff demonstrate a degree of concern on her end.
* **Holding Strong:**  Bob needs to show resolve. By continuing to reject these increasingly unfair offers, he signals that he's willing to walk away and force Alice to negotiate more reasonably."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm meeting you halfway between our last offers. Let's end this now before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Compromise:**  Bob is still aiming for a reasonable split, but he's making it clear that he's frustrated with Alice's stalling tactics. He's making a smaller concession than before.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that time is running out for both of them. This might encourage Alice to take the offer more seriously.
* **Midpoint Tactic:**  By offering a split that's exactly in the middle of their previous two proposals, Bob presents it as a fair and straightforward compromise.  This can be a powerful negotiating tool, even if it means slightly lowering his goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob. Your share is almost worthless. Don't be stubborn, take this! 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern of Exploitation:** Alice is clearly following a pattern of decreasing her offers each round, hoping Bob will crack under pressure. Accepting this would validate her strategy and lead to a terrible outcome for Bob.
* **Dangerous Precedent:** Accepting this offer would send a message that Bob is willing to accept increasingly worse deals as time goes on.  This weakens his position for the remaining rounds.
* **Last Stand:** Bob is running out of time, but so is Alice. He needs to hold strong and hope she realizes that reaching no deal is worse than accepting a somewhat fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3800,
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. I'm matching your last offer.  Take it, or we both walk away empty-handed. The clock is ticking.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Ultimatum:**  Bob needs to convey the absolute urgency of the situation. This is a do-or-die round, and Alice needs to understand that.
* **Matching Offer Tactic:** By mirroring Alice's previous offer, Bob removes any illusion of gaining a better deal through further manipulation.  It puts the ball firmly in her court.
* **Limited Options:**  With only three rounds left, Bob is running out of room to maneuver.  This offer represents a significant loss compared to his initial goal, but it's better than getting nothing at all if the game ends without a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers, Bob. Now I'm taking almost everything. Last chance! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Loss:**  This offer is atrocious. Accepting would mean a 70% loss for Bob, which is far worse than even his most pessimistic projections.
* **Calling the Bluff:**  Alice is clearly bluffing.  She knows that getting nothing is the worst possible outcome for both of them.  There's no logical reason for her to reject a deal in the next round if Bob offers even slightly more than zero. 
* **Final Round Leverage:**  Bob might only have a sliver of negotiating power left, but he still has some.  Alice has shown no willingness to compromise so far, but the prospect of getting nothing at all might finally change her tune."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 1000,
""alice_gain"": 9000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is absolutely insane, but I'd rather get something than nothing.  This is your last chance to get anything at all - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Resort:**  This is the final round, and there's no room for negotiation. Bob needs to secure *something* before the game ends and they both get nothing.
* **Exploiting Desperation:** While this offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor, it still gives her a strong incentive to accept.  Getting $9,000 is vastly better than getting $0. 
* **No Alternative:** Bob has no other choice. Offering more would be foolish at this point, as Alice has demonstrated no willingness to be fair.  This final offer is a desperate gamble, but it's the only play left to avoid a complete loss."
