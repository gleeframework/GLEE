"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm trying to be generous to see if he'll accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split it 90-10, but I'm willing to be flexible for a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to reverse the offer from round 1!

Due to inflation, my gain of $100,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. This is a significant reduction.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my $100,000 gain from the previous round is now worth 64% of its original value. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further negotiations."
