"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, acknowledging the potential for inflation to affect Bob more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation will heavily impact my earnings in the next round.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
