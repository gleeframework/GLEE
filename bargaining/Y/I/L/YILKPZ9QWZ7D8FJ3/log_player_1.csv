"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us a slight edge over time.""
}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Understanding the Discount:** The key is recognizing that Bob's share is worth less with each round due to the 5% inflation penalty.  My money stays the same value.
* **Fair but Strategic:** A near 50/50 split seems fair initially. However, the slight advantage for me (52% vs. 48%) gives me a better starting point in negotiations. 
* **Opening Message:** The message aims to frame the offer as reasonable and considering Bob's long-term interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money a bit more evenly, and hope this will encourage us to finish this game sooner.   
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is tempting as it appears more ""even"". However, it's crucial to remember that due to inflation, his $5100 is already worth less than my $4900 in real terms.  While he's willing to move closer to a 50/50 split, it's not enough to offset the value I lose over time. By rejecting, I signal I'm serious about getting a deal that reflects the impact of inflation on our shares."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Time is literally money, Bob. I'll accept a slightly smaller share if we close this deal now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  Bob is clearly aiming for a near-even split. By round 3, the inflation effect on his share is becoming more significant. My offer keeps a slight advantage for me but emphasizes the time pressure.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Offering $5100 to Bob might seem like a step back, but it's a calculated risk. It signals a willingness to negotiate while still capitalizing on the fact that my share retains its full value. 
* **The Message:** The message reinforces the urgency of the situation. Delay benefits me more than Bob.  This offer aims to encourage him to settle rather than risk further inflation."
