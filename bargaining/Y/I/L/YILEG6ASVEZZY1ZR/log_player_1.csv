"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, but I'm not giving away too much in case I can negotiate a better deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm making the offer this round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to flip the script on me!

I'll think carefully about this offer... 

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly better deal to compensate for the loss in value. However, I don't want to push my luck too much, since Bob is making a strong offer.

I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer and see if I can get an even better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's end this here and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more serious offer this time!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth less than my previous offer of $550,000. However, I also have to consider that the money is worth less overall, so I don't want to give up too much.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that 55/45 is the best split for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and see if I can get an even better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 52/48 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation. Let's see if we can finalize this!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances my desire for a good share with the reality of the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal!"
