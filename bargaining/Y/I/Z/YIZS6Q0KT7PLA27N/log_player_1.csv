"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my gains are worth the same as in the first round, I'm not incentivized to accept an offer that is worse than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money for Bob, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% and leave 55% for Bob, trying to be more favorable to Bob in this round."
