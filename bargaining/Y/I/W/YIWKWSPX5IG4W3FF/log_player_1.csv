"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to get a bigger share now to make up for it later. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll aim for a bigger share now. Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
This way, I get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money."
