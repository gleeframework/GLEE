Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very simple offer,  keeping the majority of the money for myself while giving Bob a small amount.  This is a risky strategy, but I hope it will encourage him to accept quickly and avoid any further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
