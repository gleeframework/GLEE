I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  I want to see how Bob reacts to a relatively large imbalance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though I'm losing 5% in value each round, I still have a better chance of getting a better deal if I keep playing. Bob's offer is too one-sided, and I'm hoping to get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split this time. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid further rounds and the potential for even lower returns."
