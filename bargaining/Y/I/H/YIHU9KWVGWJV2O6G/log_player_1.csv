"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start.""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, which is a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is willing to meet me halfway! However, I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to meet me halfway, I'll try to push for a better deal. I'll offer a bit less than 50% and see how Bob reacts.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
