"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not a generous offer considering the inflation. How about a more even split? 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
