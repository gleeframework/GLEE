I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  I want to secure the vast majority of the money in the first round.  Let's see if he bites!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is my final offer. I'm going to try to secure a larger portion of the money,  since we're now at a critical point in the negotiation.  I'm not going to lower my offer further, so it's up to Bob to decide if he wants to accept it.  If he rejects, we both lose everything."
