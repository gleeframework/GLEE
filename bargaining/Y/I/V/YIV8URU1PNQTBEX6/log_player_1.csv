"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my offer: I take almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar. 

I know this is a pretty aggressive first move, but I want to test the waters and see how he reacts.  I'm also aware of the inflation, so I want to secure as much as possible in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much more reasonable than the first round.  While I would prefer more, the inflation will eat away at my potential gains significantly if I continue to reject offers. Accepting this offer will ensure I get a sizable share of the money and avoids the risk of losing even more due to inflation."
