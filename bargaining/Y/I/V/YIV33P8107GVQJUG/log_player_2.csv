"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  Consider the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation will hurt Alice more than me."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a negotiation, and that 60/40 split isn't happening. I'm coming down to $5,500 for me, leaving you with $4,500. Time is running out, and the pot is shrinking. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping to get a better deal. The inflation is hitting Alice harder, and I think I can get a larger share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and it's not good for either of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ $5,200 for me, $4,800 for you. Let's close this deal before the money shrinks even further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is hitting hard, and I don't want to risk losing even more. This offer is close enough to what I was hoping for, and I don't want to risk Alice getting more in the next round."
