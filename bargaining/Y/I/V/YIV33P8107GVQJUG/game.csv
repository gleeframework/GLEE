5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. This is a negotiation, and that 60/40 split isn't happening. I'm coming down to $5,500 for me, leaving you with $4,500. Time is running out, and the pot is shrinking.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,I'm willing to compromise and split the money 55/45. It's a fair offer given the inflation rate and our previous negotiations. Let's reach an agreement before the value of the money drops even further.,Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and it's not good for either of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ $5,200 for me, $4,800 for you. Let's close this deal before the money shrinks even further.",Alice,5,
