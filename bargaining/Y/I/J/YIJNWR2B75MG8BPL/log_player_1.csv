"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. It's a risky move, but since I'm the first to propose, I'm taking a chance to maximize my share.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 200,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round due to further inflation."
