"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair considering the potential risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. This ensures we both get a good share, and while I understand the risk of inflation, I believe this is a more balanced approach. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
