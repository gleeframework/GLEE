I propose a very generous offer for Bob.  He gets $1,000, and I take the rest. This is a good starting point, and we can adjust as the rounds go on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, reflecting the inflation and the fact that he rejected my previous offer.  I'm hoping this is a fair compromise."
