I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point given the inflation risk.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the potential of losing money in the next round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, accepting this offer guarantees me $4000. If I reject and propose my own offer, I risk getting nothing in the next round due to further inflation. It's better to secure some gain than potentially lose everything."
