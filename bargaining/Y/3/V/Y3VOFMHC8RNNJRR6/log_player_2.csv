Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting us both, so let's split it evenly this time.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best option. Waiting for another round could further decrease the value of the money."
