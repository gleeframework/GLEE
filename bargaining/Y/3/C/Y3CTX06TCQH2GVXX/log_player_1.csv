"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, my share of $400,000 is effectively $320,000, and Bob's share of $600,000 is effectively $540,000. 

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a slightly larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which should give me a slightly larger share to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation.

My share of $300,000 is worth 51.2% of the original amount, which is $512,000. Bob's share of $700,000 is worth 70% of the original amount, which is $700,000.

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which should give me a larger share to account for the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation.

My share of $200,000 is worth 20% of the original amount, which is $200,000. Bob's share of $800,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $800,000.

Considering the significant inflation effect, this offer is quite generous on Bob's part. I'll accept this offer.
