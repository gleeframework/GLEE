Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25$ for me and 75$ for her, I'll offer a bit less to her to make it more attractive. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. My initial offer was 30, which is equivalent to 36 in the first round. Alice's offer is 37, which is more than my initial offer, but considering the inflation, it's actually a bit less in real terms. I'll stick to my initial offer, but I'll offer a bit more to Alice to make it more attractive.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 37$ for me and 63$ for her, I'll offer a bit more to her to make it more attractive. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original amount. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
