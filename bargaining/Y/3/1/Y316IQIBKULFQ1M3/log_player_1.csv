"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth even less. Since Bob's offer is now 50/50, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is still affecting my potential gain, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm aiming to get a larger share this time, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I think I have to consider it. With each round, the money is worth less, and I don't know how much it's worth to Bob. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
