"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I get a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a reasonable 40% of the total amount, while I take $600,000, which is 60%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about this slightly adjusted split? It accounts for the fact that time is money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 610000,
  ""bob_gain"": 390000,
  ""message"": ""My turn again! Considering inflation is affecting you, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

Since Bob's money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'm taking advantage of the situation and offering him a slightly smaller share, $390,000, while I take $610,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  It seems like you're not taking inflation seriously.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
