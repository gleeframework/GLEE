"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a 75:25 split. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60:40 split in my favor, acknowledging your initial offer and the value of my time. This provides a more equitable distribution while still considering the risk of the declining value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
