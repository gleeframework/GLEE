"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 999,000$ for myself and give 1,000$ to Bob. This way, I maximize my gain while still giving him a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this offer is significantly better than what I was initially offered and the risk of getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
