"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999,999 and give you 1 dollar. It's a fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. Take this offer, or the deal will only get worse for both of us as time goes on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before, but I'm still taking the lion's share. Accept this, or risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer I hold out, the worse it gets for me, but accepting a deal this bad sets a terrible precedent. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's stop wasting time and split the money evenly. 50/50. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient. This is my last offer. Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to bully me into accepting a bad deal. While getting nothing is a terrible outcome, I still have several rounds left and I *have* to believe she'll negotiate more fairly. Accepting this offer would be a complete capitulation and set a horrible precedent for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm standing my ground.  You're not being realistic about the impact of inflation on this deal.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but it needs to be reasonable.  This is my final offer.""}"
