"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both do better than this in future rounds 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 300,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth considering the inflation factor. If you reject, the money will be worth more to you in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to find a good solution.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to account for the inflation, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Let's see if we can do better. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
