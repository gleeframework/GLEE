"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money (900,000$).  While it's tempting to be greedy, I'm aware of the inflation and want to give Bob a reasonable amount to incentivize him to accept the offer. This way, we both get something and the game ends quickly."
