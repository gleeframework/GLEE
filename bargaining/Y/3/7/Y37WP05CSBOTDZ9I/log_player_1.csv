"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get the game over quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm being too generous, but I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in giving up 60% of the money, especially when the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 60%, I'm taking the lead!""
}
```

I'm taking a bigger share this time, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55%, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'm getting more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 55% is a fair compromise, and I'd rather take 45% now than risk waiting for a better offer that may not come."
