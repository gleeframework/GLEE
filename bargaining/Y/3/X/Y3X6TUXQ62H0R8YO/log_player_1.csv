"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than before, so the effective gain for me would be 4800.

I'm not sure if 55/45 is fair, considering the initial offer was 60/40. But I'm willing to compromise.
