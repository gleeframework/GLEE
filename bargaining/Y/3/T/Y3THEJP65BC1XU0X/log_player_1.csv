"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. My message to Bob is that we can split the money fairly without any further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less than half, think about it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept Bob's offer. He's trying to take advantage of the situation and get a larger share of the money. I'll reject his offer and try to make a better one in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting all the power, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I won't let him take all the power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to the edge, don't push it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer, but with him getting a slightly larger share. I'm not impressed. I'll reject his offer and try to make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not backing down""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an equal share of $500,000, but I'm not willing to give him more than that. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not going to give him an advantage."
