"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. Even though it seems fair, the game mechanics favor him by making Alice's money worth less with each round. He can likely get a better deal for himself by waiting and making his own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split. I'm willing to take a little less now so we can both get more in the end. Let's see if this works for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's try a 55/45 split.  This will still give you a good amount, and it will help us both get more than we would with your previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob should accept this offer. While he gets less than his initial proposal, Alice's money is now worth significantly less due to inflation.  Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a decent amount of money, and the potential for further negotiation is now quite low."
