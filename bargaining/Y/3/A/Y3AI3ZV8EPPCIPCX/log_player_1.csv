Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split. I'm willing to take a little less now so we can both get more in the end. Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
