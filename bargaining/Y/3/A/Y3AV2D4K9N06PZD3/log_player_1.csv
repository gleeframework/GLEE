"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small portion of the money, hoping to secure a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer.  With each round, the value of my share decreases, so it's in my best interest to agree now."
