Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation is different for us, but your offer was too far in your favor. Let's be reasonable: I'll take $55, you take $45.  We need to settle this before the money shrinks even more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
