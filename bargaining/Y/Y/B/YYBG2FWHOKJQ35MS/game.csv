600000.0,400000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This could set a fair starting point for negotiation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm starting with a more aggressive offer, but willing to compromise. I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split given the risk of future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I believe a 50/50 split would be fair given the equal value of our contributions in this round. It also sets a precedent for equitable division moving forward.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split given my previous offers and the risk of future rounds. I'm trying to find a middle ground.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
