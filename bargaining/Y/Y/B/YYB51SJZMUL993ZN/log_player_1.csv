"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making my decision.

Since I know that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll propose a 60/40 split, hoping to get a higher share of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""A fairer split, considering the previous offer""
}
```"
