"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose to take 95% of the money and give Bob 5%. This is a strong opening offer, showing my confidence in my ability to negotiate. However, it's not completely unreasonable and gives Bob a small incentive to accept, especially considering the possibility of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  However, the inflation means my potential gains are shrinking with each round. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a decent amount, rather than risk further inflation and potentially ending up with less."
