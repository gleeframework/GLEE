Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to be a bit more generous to Alice, but still aim for a relatively fair split considering the depreciation.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering depreciation, let's aim for a slightly more balanced split.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a better offer than your last, considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I believe the depreciation affects Alice more significantly, and I can try to negotiate a better split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing depreciation and the fact that Alice is under more pressure due to the 10% decrease in value per round.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Given the time pressure and depreciation, I think this is a more reasonable split now.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant depreciation for both of us, but especially for Alice, I think an even split at this point is the most reasonable offer. Continuing to negotiate further might lead to less value for both of us, so I'll accept this offer to ensure we both get something worthwhile."
