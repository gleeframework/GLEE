Let's see what Alice offers next!  I want to try to get a bigger share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a more even split. I'm hoping Alice will see that it's in her best interest to accept, especially since we only have 12 rounds to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With inflation kicking in, I'm happy to take an even split.  Better to get something than to risk losing everything!"
