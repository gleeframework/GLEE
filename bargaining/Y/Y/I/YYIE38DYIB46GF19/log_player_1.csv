"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a relatively generous offer.  I figure that if Bob accepts, we both get a good amount of money. If he rejects, I know I'll have a chance to make another offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my original offer, even with the 10% inflation.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than my initial offer, taking into account the inflation.  I'm hoping he'll accept this time since I know he's feeling the pressure of inflation too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is much worse than my initial proposal,  I'm getting a significant amount of money, and the inflation is rapidly decreasing the value of money in each round.  I'll accept this offer before it gets worse."
