"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I need to adjust my gain to account for the 5% decrease in value. Since I was initially proposing a 60-40 split, I'll calculate my gain as 60% of the original amount, then apply the 5% decrease.

Initially, 60% of $10,000 is $6,000. With a 5% decrease, that's $6,000 * 0.95 = $5,700.

So, I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think a 60-40 split in your favor is fair, considering the initial proposal was 60-40 in my favor. I'd like to make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value. Since I rejected Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split.

I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is still a relatively fair split, but slightly more in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A 55-45 split seems reasonable, considering the inflation. Let's try this!""
}
```"
