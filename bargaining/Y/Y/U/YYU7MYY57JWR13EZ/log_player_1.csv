# Bob gain: 4000

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  

* **Inflation is biting:** The inflation is significantly impacting both sides, but especially Bob.  Waiting any longer will only result in smaller gains for both.
* **Matching the original offer:** Bob is now matching the offer Alice initially proposed. While Alice might have aimed for a slightly higher amount, accepting ensures a reasonable share before inflation erodes the value further.
* **Risk of losing everything:**  With each passing round, the risk of walking away with nothing increases. It's better to secure a deal now than be greedy and potentially lose everything."
