"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a small fraction of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Take this compromise and let's end the game early! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a compromise, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to maximize my gain. I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need for games! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split? That's a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept Bob's offer.
