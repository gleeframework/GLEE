"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split - 90% for me, 10% for you. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's not a very fair offer, and I can do better than 10%!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the potential for inflation. This ensures we both get a good share of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. 60/40 feels more balanced. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more equal split, accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing due to further inflation."
