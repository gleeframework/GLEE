Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll try to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

While I would prefer more,  with each round the inflation is cutting into my potential gains more and more.  It's better to take the 400,000 than risk getting nothing."
