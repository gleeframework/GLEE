"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to be generous for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, this offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer. I'll accept it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
