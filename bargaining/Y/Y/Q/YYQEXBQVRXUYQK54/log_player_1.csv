"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting with a 60-40 split? I'll meet you halfway at 55-45. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a more favorable split for himself.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 55, but I want 45.5""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, asking for a slightly higher percentage for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 58, but I need 42 to feel comfortable.""
}
```

I'm making a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation. I'm proposing a 58-42 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. The message is a clear indication of my willingness to compromise, but also to maintain a reasonable share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit more generous, but I'm still not sold on 42. I'll meet you at 50-50, but I'll throw in a slight favor to you: 49.5-50.5 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for himself.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'll take the 49.5-50.5 split.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as the 49.5-50.5 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to take the slightly smaller share to avoid further negotiations."
