"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I want to maximize my share of the money. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm assuming Bob will be more likely to accept a deal that benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is already taking a toll, and the money I'd get now is worth less than the 90 I initially proposed.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get some money."
