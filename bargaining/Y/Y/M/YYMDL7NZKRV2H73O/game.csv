6000.0,4000.0,"Let's split the money so we both get a good deal. I propose I take $6,000 and you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from the initial sum.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Let's split it 55-45. It's a better deal than your initial offer, considering the inflation.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round, and this offer still gives you a reasonable amount compared to waiting even longer. It's better to take a decent deal now than risk getting even less later.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I think it's fair to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. It's the best I can do without feeling like I'm losing out.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You're losing significantly more with each round that passes. My offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. Take the deal now before it's worth even less for you!",Alice,5,
