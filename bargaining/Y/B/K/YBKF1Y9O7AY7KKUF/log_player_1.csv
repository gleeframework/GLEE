"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair share, considering the initial amount is $1,000,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This seems like the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept the even split just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. I think $300,000 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a bit more skewed in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, but I need to get at least 400000 to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept $600,000. It's a bit more than my previous offer, and it's a fair trade-off considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's finalize the deal!"
