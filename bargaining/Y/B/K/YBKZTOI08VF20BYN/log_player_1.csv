"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting tougher!

Considering the inflation, my $2,000 gain is now worth 90% of the original $6,000 I was offered in Round 1, which is $5,400. However, Bob's $8,000 gain is only 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000.

I'll have to think carefully...

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leave $5,500 for Bob. This seems like a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of money!

Considering the inflation, my $3,000 gain is now worth 69.9% of the original $6,000 I was offered in Round 1, which is $4,194. My $3,000 gain is actually a decrease from my previous offer of $4,500.

However, Bob's $7,000 gain is now worth 70.0% of the original $10,000, which is $7,000.

I'll have to think carefully...

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in Round 2, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3150,
  ""bob_gain"": 6850,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $3,150 and leave $6,850 for Bob. This seems like a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of money with each round."
