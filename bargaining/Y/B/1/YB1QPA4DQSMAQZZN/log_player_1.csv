"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 20% less than my original proposal, which is $600,000 - 20% = $480,000. And Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 5% less than his original proposal, which is $400,000 - 5% = $380,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's less valuable than my original proposal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
