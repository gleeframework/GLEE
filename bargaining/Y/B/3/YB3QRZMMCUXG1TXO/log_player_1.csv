"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm offering Bob 2000 dollars, which is 20% of the initial 10,000. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can still have some room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate if you want to try something else. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about accepting an even split, but I do appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 5000 dollars and see where the game goes from here."
