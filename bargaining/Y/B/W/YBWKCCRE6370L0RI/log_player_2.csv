Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider the inflation working against you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%. Let's split it 55/45, keeping in mind the inflation issue. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The inflation is starting to hurt, Alice. I'm matching your previous offer, but reversed. Take it before it gets worse for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This inflation is getting serious! Let's split it evenly before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
At this point, getting $5,000 is a good deal for Bob. Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is offering a 50/50 split.  While Bob might get a slightly better deal if he holds out longer, there's a risk that Alice will get desperate and offer a much smaller amount in a later round, or the game will end with no deal.
