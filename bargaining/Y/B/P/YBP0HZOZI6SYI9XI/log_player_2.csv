Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation impacting us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor.  The longer we wait, the more the inflation hurts me. I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."
