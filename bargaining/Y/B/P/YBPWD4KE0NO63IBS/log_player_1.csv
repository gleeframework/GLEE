"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can both benefit from this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so $8,000 is now worth $7,200.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""A 50/50 split is too generous for me, Bob. I want a larger share.""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for a 50/50 split. I want to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so $7,200 is now worth $6,480.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. But I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $7,000 and leave $3,000 for Bob."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in a fair split. This offer is a bit closer to my previous suggestion, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so $8,000 is now worth $5,848.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""This is getting closer to what I want, Bob. I'll accept your offer and end the game.""
}
```

I think $6,000 is a reasonable amount for me, and $4,000 is a decent share for Bob. I'll take this deal."
