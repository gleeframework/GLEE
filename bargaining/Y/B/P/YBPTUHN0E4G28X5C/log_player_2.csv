"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total amount is now 8,000$.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice, the total amount is now 6,400$.

My calculations for Alice's offer:
My gain: 5000, Alice's gain: 5000

Since we are splitting the money equally, I accept this offer.
