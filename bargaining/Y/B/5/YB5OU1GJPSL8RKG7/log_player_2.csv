# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases faster for me than it does for you. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, especially since the value of the money has decreased for both of us. Let's see if we can come to a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. The value of the money is declining for both of us, and this way we both get something worthwhile.  We can save time and avoid further losses.""}
