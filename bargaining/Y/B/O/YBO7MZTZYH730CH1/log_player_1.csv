"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's compromise"" to Bob. I'm trying to appear reasonable while still getting a slightly larger share. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and cooperation. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I don't have to worry about the inflation affecting my share. On the other hand, Bob is under pressure to make a deal because his share is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm being generous considering the circumstances""}\n\nI'm making a new offer that's even more favorable to me than my initial one. Since Bob's share is worth less with each passing round, I'm trying to take advantage of the situation by offering him a smaller share. My message is an attempt to make my offer seem reasonable and generous, considering the inflation that's affecting Bob's share. I'm hoping that Bob will feel pressured to accept my offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  We both need to compromise to make this work.  I'm taking the hit on the inflation, but I need to get at least 6000. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think it's the best deal I can get at this point. Although I was trying to take advantage of the inflation affecting Bob's share, his offer is still relatively reasonable, and I don't want to risk him making an even lower offer in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I'm not losing anything by accepting this offer, and I'm getting a decent share of the $10,000. Bob's message also suggests that he's unwilling to compromise further, so I think it's time to accept and end the game. Let's finalize the deal! {""decision"": ""accept""}"
