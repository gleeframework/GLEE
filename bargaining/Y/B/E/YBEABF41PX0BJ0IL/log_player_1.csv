"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice.  It's the fairest way to start, and we can both walk away with a good chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering the initial amount was $10,000. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a larger share, but let's be reasonable.  A 40/60 split is fair considering the inflation.  Accept this and we can both still walk away with a good amount of money. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.5208 ≈ 1151.92
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.5208 ≈ 769.23

I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now, considering the decreased value of the money. I'll accept the offer.
