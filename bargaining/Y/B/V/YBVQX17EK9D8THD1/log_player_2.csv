Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I propose a 52.5/47.5 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for potential value loss over time. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While I lost 36% of the value of my potential gain, Alice lost only 9.75%.  This means the power dynamic has shifted in her favor.
* **Previous Offer:**  My previous offer (60/40) was rejected, indicating Alice is willing to push for a more even split.
* **Current Offer:** This offer gives me a decent share (47.5%) while recognizing the impact of inflation and Alice's negotiating stance. 

**Conclusion:**  It's better to accept this offer and secure a reasonable gain rather than risk another round and potentially face a less favorable outcome."
