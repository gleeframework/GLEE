"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k and take 600k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a fair starting point, I think. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to mirror my initial offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split. I think I can do better than that. Let's try to find a more favorable split for me.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and trying to convey that I'm looking for a better deal. It's my turn to make a new proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, Bob. 55% for me and 45% for you. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, but still keeping the offer relatively close to the original 60-40 split."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable.  Let's try to reach an agreement before things get even more difficult. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to stick to his guns. However, I've got to take into account the inflation that's been eating away at the value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, Bob. The money is worth less and less with each passing round. I need a better deal to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, and trying to convey that I'm not willing to settle for a deal that doesn't account for the decreasing value of the money."

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. 52% for me and 48% for you. It's getting late in the game, and I'm not sure how much longer we can keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, but I'm also trying to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  A 52/48 split is a good compromise given the current situation.  We need to reach an agreement before we both lose out to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to meet you halfway, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'll make you a new offer, but it's going to be my last one.""
}
```

{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. I'm willing to give you 51% of the remaining money. It's a good deal considering the inflation, and I think it's time for us to wrap this up.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, but I'm also trying to be realistic about the situation. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
