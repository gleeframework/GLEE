Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. I'm willing to give you 51% of the remaining money. It's a good deal considering the inflation, and I think it's time for us to wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's getting really risky to keep rejecting offers.  Alice's offer is still better than what I'd get if we keep going and the inflation continues to eat away at our potential gains."
