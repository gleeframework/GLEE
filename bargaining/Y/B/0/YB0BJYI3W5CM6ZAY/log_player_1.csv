"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point considering the inflation we'll both face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds.

I accept the offer.
