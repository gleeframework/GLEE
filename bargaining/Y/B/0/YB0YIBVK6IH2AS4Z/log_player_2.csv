Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, Bob's loss due to inflation is not my problem 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer Bob waits, the less his share is worth due to the 10% inflation per round. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered proposals favoring herself and seems unwilling to budge significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between Alice's current offer and holding out for a potentially slightly better deal in later rounds is increasingly insignificant compared to the guaranteed loss from inflation.

Accepting a 43/57 split is far from fair, but in this scenario, it's the best way to salvage some value from the situation."
