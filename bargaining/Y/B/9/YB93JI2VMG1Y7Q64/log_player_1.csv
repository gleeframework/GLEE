"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who really deserves the big cut! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about it.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, where I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it! I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but don't think you're getting off that easy! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's message is quite condescending! However, I need to consider the offer.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this one. I'm not thrilled about getting only $300,000, but I don't want to risk going back to the drawing board.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
