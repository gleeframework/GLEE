Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a smaller cut than before, but I still need a decent share to keep playing. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a fairer split, time is working against me faster than it is against her. Accepting this offer would give me 4000$, which is already a significant loss compared to what I could have gotten in the first round. I need to push for a better deal in the next round before inflation eats away at the value even further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. We need to settle this now before inflation hurts us both. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players.  Delaying further is risky.
* **Finding a balance:** While I want a larger share, I need to offer Alice something tempting enough to accept. 
* **Strong stance:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to convey seriousness and push Alice towards a decision."
