Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both losing value, but I still think my share should be higher. Let's try to meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, accepting ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing if we continue to fail to agree. 

Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:** I'm losing a large chunk of value with each round. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now might be better than getting a slightly better offer later when it's worth significantly less.
* **Uncertain Future:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer me a better deal in the subsequent rounds. She might even stick to her current offer, making me lose out even more due to inflation. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes accepting a compromise, even if not perfect, is the more logical choice in the face of uncertainty and loss.
