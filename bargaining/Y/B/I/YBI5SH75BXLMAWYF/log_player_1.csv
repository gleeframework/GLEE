"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the total amount. This leaves me with $700,000, which is 70% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In Round 1, I offered Bob $300,000, which was 30% of the total amount. Due to inflation, the value of that amount is now 95% of its original value, so it's worth $285,000.

Now, Bob's offer in Round 2 is to split the money 50/50, which would give me $500,000, or 50% of the current total amount. This is actually a better offer than what I originally proposed, considering the effects of inflation.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
