"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing to keep 90% of the money, and give Bob 10%. This way, we both get a decent amount, and it leaves room for negotiation in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a much worse deal for me than the previous round. I'm only getting $50,000, which is significantly less than the $900,000 I was offered before. While I need to be mindful of the inflation, I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $800,000 for myself, but increasing Bob's to $200,000.  This seems like a fairer split, considering we are both losing some value due to inflation.  I'm hoping Bob will be more agreeable to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, even though I'm losing value due to inflation. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can get a better deal, especially since I'm still getting a significant portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $700,000 for myself, but increasing Bob's share to $300,000.  I believe this shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a majority of the funds. With each passing round, the value of the money is diminishing, and I need to find a balance between securing a good deal and ensuring we reach an agreement before the value is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is becoming more generous in terms of my share, it's still significantly lower than the $900,000 I initially offered.  We're nearing the middle of the game, and I'm still losing a substantial amount of value due to inflation. I'm willing to take another risk and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer once again to $600,000, but I'm also significantly increasing Bob's share to $400,000. With inflation rapidly decreasing the value of the money, I need to start meeting Bob halfway to ensure we reach an agreement before the value is too low. I'm hoping this shows my commitment to finding a resolution and securing a deal that is beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with this offer, even though the inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate. It's risky, but I'm willing to take another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With time running out and inflation taking its toll, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equal division, considering the significant decrease in value the money has experienced.  It's time to compromise and avoid risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with this offer, even though it's getting increasingly difficult to secure a good deal with the constant inflation.  I'm willing to take another risk and hope that Bob will come to a more reasonable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to make a bold move and offer a 40/60 split. This is a significant increase for Bob, reflecting the urgent need to reach an agreement. The inflation is severely affecting both of us, and I'm willing to take a hit to secure a deal before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision. The offer is significantly lower than what I initially hoped for, and the value of the money has decreased dramatically. However, with only one round left, I have to accept this offer to secure something. It's better to get $50,000 than nothing at all."
