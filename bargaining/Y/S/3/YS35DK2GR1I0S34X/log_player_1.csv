"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to give Bob half of the money, which is a fair and equal split. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more skewed towards his side, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll calculate my actual gain in this round:

$400,000 is 90% of $444,444.44 (the amount I would have gained in the previous round), which is still a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for this round.
