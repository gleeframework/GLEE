Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose we split the money 51/49 in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
