Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  Inflation is hitting us both, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option.  We can avoid further losses if we agree now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
