"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's try to find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
