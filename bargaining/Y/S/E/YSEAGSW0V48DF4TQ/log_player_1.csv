I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and propose a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I'm getting significantly less than I wanted, I'm still getting something, and the inflation makes it clear that I won't get much better in the next round.  It's better to secure at least something than risk getting nothing."
