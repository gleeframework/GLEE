I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob accepts, I get most of the money right away. If he rejects, I know I'll get at least 9000 in the next round due to inflation, but it could be more if I can convince him to accept a smaller amount later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation is a serious factor. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the reduced value of the money in the next round."
