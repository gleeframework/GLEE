Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need for a quick resolution due to inflation. How about we meet a bit closer to the middle? This offer still gives you a slight advantage. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems clear we both value our positions.  Let's split this evenly and call it a day. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

It's painful to see the potential gains dwindle, but Bob is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures I get something rather than nothing if this goes to the final round."
