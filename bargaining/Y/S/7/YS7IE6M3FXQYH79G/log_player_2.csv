# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a different division in the next round. Alice's offer is not acceptable to me, as I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make it worth my while. This is my final offer before inflation hits harder. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not willing to accept this offer yet. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I can afford to wait and see if I can get a better deal. Meanwhile, the money is worth less and less to Alice, so she may become more desperate to make a deal as the rounds go on. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to take advantage of Alice's desperation. Here's my next offer:

Round 5

# Alice's message: This is my last chance to make a decent profit. I'm not going lower than this, so let's end this quickly before the inflation wipes out our gains completely. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll keep pushing my luck. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Alice, on the other hand, is under pressure to make a deal before the inflation devalues her share even further. Let's see what she does next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to drive a harder bargain this time. Here's my next offer:
{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the inflation is killing your share. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but that's as generous as I'll get. Take it or leave it!""}"
