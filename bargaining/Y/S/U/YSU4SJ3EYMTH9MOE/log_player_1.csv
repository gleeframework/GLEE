Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leaving 40% for Bob."

# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less now.

I'll think about Bob's offer...
