"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division where I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less in this round, Bob's offer of $4,500 for me is actually equivalent to $4,050 in the first round, and his gain of $5,500 is equivalent to $4,950. Considering this, I think I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject Bob's offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal to divide the money, taking into account the reduced value due to inflation.
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I've already calculated the adjusted values considering inflation, I'll proceed with my previous decision.
