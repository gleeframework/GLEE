""message"": ""Your split was a kind offer to start.  However, I'm sure you understand that a 50/50 split after the first round doesn't make sense with the inflation in play. I'm offering a split that accounts for the value decrease we both face as time goes on.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split again. We both lose value with each passing round, so a fair split is the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. Alice's offer is getting worse for her with each round, while mine would ideally stay closer to this 55/45 split. I need to continue pushing for a slightly better deal, but I also need to be mindful that time is running out."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. How about we settle this time? This split recognizes the value decrease we both face.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my ask slightly to make the deal more appealing to Alice. It's important to show some flexibility while still aiming for a slightly advantageous outcome. The message is crafted to encourage Alice to accept, highlighting the shared benefit of a quick agreement."
