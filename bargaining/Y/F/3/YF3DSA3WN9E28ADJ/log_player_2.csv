Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth significantly less now. While Alice's offer is far from the 900,000 I initially offered, it's still much better than the 100,000 she offered me in the first round.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means I'm risking even further devaluation of the money, and Alice might offer even less in the next round. 

This offer is a decent compromise considering the inflation, and I'm better off taking it to secure some gains."
