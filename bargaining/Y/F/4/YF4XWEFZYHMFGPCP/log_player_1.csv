"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to be generous and start with a fair split. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 60, now it's my turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money I'll be getting.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make an even better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, trying to find a middle ground and hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said meet in the middle, but I'm not sure if we're on the same page... 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to drive a hard bargain!

Considering the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money I'll be getting.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, especially with the inflation affecting Bob's gain. I'll keep waiting for a more favorable offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob! Meet me at 55!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and move closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still pushing for a slightly higher share for myself."
