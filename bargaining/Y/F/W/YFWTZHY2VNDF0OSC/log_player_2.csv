Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact on your side, my share should be a bit higher 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 440000,
""alice_gain"": 560000,
""message"": ""This offer is a concession considering the inflation is impacting me more with each round. Let's close this deal and move on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, it's time to close the deal. This is my final concession 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the impact of inflation is severe. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer results in a better outcome than continuing to negotiate and potentially getting even less in future rounds.
