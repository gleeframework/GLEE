"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share this time, but be fair next round and we'll both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for my turn to propose a more favorable division. With inflation looming, I'd rather take a chance on getting a better deal next round than accept this uneven split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be fair to avoid further inflation losses.""}\n\n###\nI've decided to propose a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation factor. By offering Alice a significant share, I'm hoping she'll see the benefit in accepting this deal rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
