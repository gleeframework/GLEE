Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need to make sure I'm getting something out of this deal. Let's make this fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate due to the inflation heavily impacting his potential gains.  While this offer is closer to a more ""fair"" split, I'm betting I can get Bob to offer me at least half on the next round."
