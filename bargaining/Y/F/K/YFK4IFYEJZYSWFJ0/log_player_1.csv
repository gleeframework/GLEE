"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:
