"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a very aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is too lopsided in Bob's favor.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm still in a good position to negotiate. I'll try to get a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation, but still trying to get a larger share.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than risking nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting more reasonable due to inflation, I'm still not comfortable with such a significant disparity. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm again adjusting my offer to reflect inflation, but I'm still trying to get a majority of the money. The inflation is working in my favor as it makes Bob's potential gains smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Even though the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, I'm still not ready to accept such a lopsided offer.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to adjust my offer based on the inflation, but I'm trying to maintain a balance.  I want to get a significant share, but I also need to be mindful of Bob's potential gains.  This offer represents a compromise that hopefully Bob will accept."
