Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now (due to 10% inflation), I'll aim for a higher share.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

Since Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, I'll think carefully. Given the inflation, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. But it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
