"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While a 50/50 split seems fair initially, the inflation heavily impacts me as Bob. It's better to negotiate for a more favorable split in the early rounds."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but her offer still doesn't fully account for the disparity in inflation we face. While 4200 is a reasonable starting point, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds. The longer it takes for Alice to propose a fairer deal, the more pressure she'll be under as the shrinking pot affects her gains too."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""We're getting closer! I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to reflect the faster rate of inflation I'm experiencing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, inflation is hitting you harder. Let's adjust, but not too far 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation more seriously, but her offer is still not attractive enough. While a 4400/5600 split sounds like a compromise, we're now five rounds in, meaning my initial 4400 is worth significantly less.  It's time to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to push closer to the deadline.  Another rejection might make her realize the shrinking pot is a losing situation for both of us."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6400, ""alice_gain"": 3600, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic. Time is running out, and the value is shrinking. This offer still leans in your favor considering the inflation, but let's settle this before it's too late.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a calculated gamble. I'm sticking to a 64/36 split to firmly emphasize the inflation disparity, but the message is more urgent.  We're past the halfway point, and Alice needs to understand that her stubbornness could cost us both. By offering a seemingly generous split (while accounting for inflation) and highlighting the shrinking pot, I'm hoping to pressure her into accepting a deal favorable to me."
