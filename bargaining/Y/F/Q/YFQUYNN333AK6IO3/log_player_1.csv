"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think for a moment... With the inflation, my gain of 60 is actually worth $54, and Bob's gain of 40 is worth $32. Still a decent offer, but I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a fair share. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to 65, which is worth $58.15 with the current inflation rate. Let's see if Bob will meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Let's calculate the actual values of the offer: with the current inflation rate, my gain of 55 is worth $37.15, and Bob's gain of 45 is worth $23.40.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. It's still a decent proposal, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with lower values.
