"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from there!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm looking to get a bigger share for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards your favor, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but 70% is too much. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 40% is a fair compromise. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, it's a fair split, but I'm not going to give you more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I'll accept your offer. 60/40 it is. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm hoping this is the final round, and we can wrap up the game."
