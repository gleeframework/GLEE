"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though the inflation impacts my gains more significantly (10% vs Bob's 5%), accepting this offer is still better than continuing to play.  

Here's why:

* **Round 3:** If I reject this offer, I get to propose in round 3. However, the money will be worth even less then. I'd likely need to offer Bob a larger share to get him to accept, further diminishing my own gain. 
* **Risk vs Reward:** The risk of continuing the game is that I might not get any money at all if we keep rejecting offers. It's more beneficial to take the smaller gain now and avoid the uncertainty."
