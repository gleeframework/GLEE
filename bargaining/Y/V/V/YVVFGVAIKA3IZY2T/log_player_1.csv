"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $50, which is 50% of the current value of the money.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a decent offer. I'll accept it.
