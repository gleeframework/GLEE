"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and inviting Bob to make a counteroffer or accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 70$ is worth 0.95 * 70 = 66.5$ (5% less), and Bob's gain of 30$ is worth 0.8 * 30 = 24$ (20% less).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'd rather get a bit more than 66.5$. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I still want a decent amount for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting nothing 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 80$ is worth 0.85 * 80 = 68$ (14.26% less), and Bob's gain of 20$ is worth 0.516 * 20 = 10.32$ (48.8% less).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate. I think I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the next round.
