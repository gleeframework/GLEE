"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%. Let's see if he accepts!"

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
