Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  I'm not going to go any lower than this, though.  It's my turn to make an offer, and I think this is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, the deal still isn't favorable enough for me (Bob). The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts Alice. It's time to apply more pressure and hope she cracks before the later rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  I'm seeing your point about time, and I'm willing to compromise. This is my final offer: 4000 for me, 6000 for you.  Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has finally agreed to the 60/40 split that I proposed earlier. There's no guarantee she'll offer anything better, and the risk of continuing the negotiations outweighs the potential reward of a slightly better deal.  It's time to take the win and end the game."
