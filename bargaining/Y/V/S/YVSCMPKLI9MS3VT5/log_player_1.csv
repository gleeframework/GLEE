I'm getting closer to my desired outcome, but Bob's inflation is hurting him. I'm hoping to get a better offer from him next round, but if not, I'm willing to risk it and see what happens."

I have to accept this offer.  Even though I'm not getting my ideal outcome, it's better than getting nothing at all. The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and I'm not sure he'll be able to offer me a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the loss to secure something rather than risk getting nothing."
