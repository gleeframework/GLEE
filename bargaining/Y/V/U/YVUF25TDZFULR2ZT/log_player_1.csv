Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a classic power move here.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept just a single dollar!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd love to keep fighting for a bigger share, the inflation is real and the risk of getting nothing is too high. Accepting this offer is the best option for me to secure a decent amount."
