"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer gives me a large majority of the money (900,000$) while leaving Bob with a smaller portion (100,000$).  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's better than nothing. If he rejects it, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, which is a significant improvement from the previous round. It's also likely that I won't be able to get a better offer in the future due to inflation, which might lead to getting nothing at all."
