"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is: ""Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more."" This is a fairly generous offer considering we're at the beginning of the game, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this proposal to avoid further inflation and potential loss of money in subsequent rounds. The ball is now in Bob's court to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it 60/40, since I'm making the offer this time. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this round, Bob has offered a split of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for himself, with the reasoning that it's fair since he's making the offer this time. Considering the impact of inflation, the money is now worth 5% less than in the first round. Given that I initially offered Bob $400,000 and he rejected it, and now the roles are reversed but the offer amount for me is the same, I don't see a compelling reason to accept this offer. The decrease in value due to inflation and the principle of trying to maximize my gain suggest that I should reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal. Therefore, my response is to reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn again! Please proceed to Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, considering the rejection of the previous offers and the impact of inflation, which has now decreased the value of the money by 10% from the original amount, I will adjust my offer to try and find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob. This time, I propose a division of $580,000 for myself and $420,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is: ""Considering the decrease in value, let's meet closer to the middle."" This offer slightly reduces my gain from the initial proposal, taking into account the urgency to reach an agreement before the money loses more value.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the decrease in value, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! Please respond to this offer."
