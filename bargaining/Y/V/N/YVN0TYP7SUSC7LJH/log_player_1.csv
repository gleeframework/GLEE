I'm willing to give Bob a little more, but I still want the majority share since the inflation is hurting me more."

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to settle now than to risk losing even more money in the next round due to inflation."

I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation has significantly reduced my potential earnings, it's better to take what I can get at this point. I've learned that Bob is willing to push for a larger share, and I'm not sure I'll be able to negotiate anything better in the next round."
