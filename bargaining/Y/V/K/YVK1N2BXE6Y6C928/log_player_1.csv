Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. Since the money is worth the same for both of us at this point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher share, hoping that Bob will find the offer reasonable and accept it early on to avoid potential losses due to inflation in subsequent rounds.\n\nYour turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is now worth 10% less for me, I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split that benefits Bob more due to the inflation.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more, but still fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $52 for myself and $48 for Bob. Given that the money is now worth 10% less for me, I'm trying to compensate for the loss by taking a slightly larger share.
