"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial gain of 8000 is now worth 6400.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a slightly better deal, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the initial $10,000, my goal is to get a good share before it's too late.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but don't expect more""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the remaining value, which I think is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly better share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the initial $10,000, my initial gain of 8000 is now worth approximately 4160.

Considering Bob's offer, meeting in the middle at 5000 each seems like a reasonable compromise. I think I'll accept this offer.
