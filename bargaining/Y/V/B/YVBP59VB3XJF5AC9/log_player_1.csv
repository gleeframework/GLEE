"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking on the risk of rejection in this round.  Let's work together to make this a win-win! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'm slightly more inclined to accept a higher share for myself. However, 60/40 seems a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor.

I'll counter with a compromise:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but 55/45 is my limit. Let's aim for a more balanced split.""
}
```

It's Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I still think 55/45 is a fairer split. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm keeping my stance on the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to see if he'll accept."
