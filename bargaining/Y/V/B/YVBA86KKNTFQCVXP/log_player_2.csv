Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60:40 is a more reasonable split, considering the risk of inflation.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose a 55:45 split. This maintains a fair balance while accounting for potential future value loss. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
