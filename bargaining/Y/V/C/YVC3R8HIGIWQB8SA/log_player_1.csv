"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and take $60 for myself. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I want to try to end the game early. However, I also want to be somewhat fair to Bob to increase the chances of him accepting my offer.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this is a better deal for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now. Although the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I believe I can try to negotiate a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me. Given the inflation, I have an incentive to try to end the game as soon as possible, but I'm not ready to accept this offer yet.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $45 and take $55 for myself. Given that the money is worth even less to me now due to inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, while also taking into account my own diminishing returns. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering I've moved closer to his previous offer, and that he'll see the value in ending the game sooner rather than later.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to this offer.\n\n###"
