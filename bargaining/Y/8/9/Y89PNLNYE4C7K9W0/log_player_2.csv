"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 70%, you take 30%.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer to split it more evenly. I'll take 40%, you take 60%. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! This is my final offer - it's a good deal for both of us.  
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though the money is worth less for me, it's better to take the deal now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
