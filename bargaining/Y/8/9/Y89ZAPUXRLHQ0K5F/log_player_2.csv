Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get a bit more this round. I think Alice will be happy with a slightly smaller share, especially since she rejected my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation hurts, I'm taking this offer.  I'm not sure how many more rounds we have left, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal."
