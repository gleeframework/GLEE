"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose we split the money 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob. This way, I get the majority share, but it's a fair starting point.  Let's see if he's happy with that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least $5,000, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
