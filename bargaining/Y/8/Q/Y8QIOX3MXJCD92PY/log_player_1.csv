"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and simple starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more due to my negotiation skills 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm effectively losing 20% of the value of the money I would gain in this round compared to the first round.

Given that Bob's offer is 40, which is a relatively low amount, I'm inclined to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. After all, I think I can do better than 40.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was 60, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that, considering the inflation effect.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 45 is a fair amount for you. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55, but I'm not sure it's a good deal for me with the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get back to the 55/45 split we discussed in Round 3, but this time with him gaining the larger amount.

Considering the inflation effect, the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, and even less than in Round 2. Given that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I think I'm getting a better deal this time around.

However, I'm not sure if Bob's concerns about the deal being a good one for him are valid. Since he's not offering anything more than the previous 55/45 split, I'll decide to accept this offer.
