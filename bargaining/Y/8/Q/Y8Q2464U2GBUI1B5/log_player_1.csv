"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $3,000 is actually $3,000 / 0.9 = $3,333.33 in real terms.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of $3,000 is now worth $3,000 / 0.9^2 = $3,333.33 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is still worth $7,000 in real terms.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think $4,200 is a fair amount for me.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is hitting hard! With the money being worth 10% less each round, my gain of $2,000 is now worth $2,000 / 0.9^3 = $2,000 / 0.729 = $2,744.44 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $8,000 is still worth $8,000 in real terms.

I'm not too happy with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
