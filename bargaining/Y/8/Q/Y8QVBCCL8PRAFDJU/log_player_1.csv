Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation, or we both lose! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Let's see why it makes sense to reject this offer. While it appears Bob is considering inflation, his offer is still not advantageous to us in the long run. We need to aim for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation affects us both. This offer ensures a fairer deal considering the decreasing value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** Bob's offer in Round 2 was designed to appear fair while still favoring him. By offering a 55/45 split in our favor, we're countering his tactic and aiming for a more balanced outcome.
* **Inflation Pressure:**  Both our potential gains continue to decrease. By Round 3, the money's value has significantly diminished.  We need to secure a reasonable amount before it depreciates further.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  Bob's message in Round 2 indicates he understands the impact of inflation. Our offer, while still favoring us slightly, acknowledges this shared concern and might be enough to secure an agreement before we reach a Round 4 with even less value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting us hard, let's be rational and close the deal! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money has significantly decreased. Accepting $42 now is better than risking another round where we might get even less. 
* **Bob's Likely Stance:** Bob's message and offer suggest he's feeling the pressure of inflation. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 5 and beyond carries a substantial risk. The potential gain is outweighed by how much the money will depreciate. 

While not ideal, accepting this offer cuts our losses and ends the game with a somewhat reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
