"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, you get a small share. We can renegotiate if you want. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty bold opening offer from Alice. I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 99% of the money just yet. I'll reject the offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better share. I'll aim to get at least 50% of the remaining value.

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""You're starting high, I'm starting low. Meet me in the middle?""}"
