"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose that I get $90 and Bob gets $10.  This seems like a fair starting point, giving me a significant share while still acknowledging that Bob deserves something for participating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is not fair!  Bob is taking advantage of inflation and trying to get all the money. I'll wait for my turn to make a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my share to 80, but I'm confident Bob will recognize that continuing to reject offers will lead to a worse outcome for him.  With inflation, the value of his gains will continue to decrease, while I'm still willing to offer him a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is still being greedy!  Inflation is hitting us both, and continuing to reject offers will only hurt both of us in the long run. I'm not going to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still being fair. Bob needs to realize that we both need to find a solution soon before inflation completely destroys the value of our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed is getting out of hand.  This offer is worse than the last one, and it's clear he's just trying to exploit inflation to get the most he can.  I won't let him win this way.  I'll keep fighting for a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

We are nearing the end of the game, and inflation is hurting us both. I'm reducing my share once more, but I'm confident that Bob will recognize this is the best deal he's likely to get.  It's time for us to be reasonable and come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn and refuses to budge. He's trying to get a larger share of the diminishing value of the money, while I'm the one actually taking the risk of inflation. It's time for me to stand my ground and reject this offer. I won't be bullied by his greed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is it. Inflation is at a critical point.  It's time for us to reach a compromise. We both need to accept that we're losing money with each passing round, and if we don't agree, we'll both end up with nothing. This is the most equitable solution given the current situation. It's time to be rational and end this."
