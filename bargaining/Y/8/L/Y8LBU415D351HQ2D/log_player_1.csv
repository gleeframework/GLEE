I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer. I'll take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  I'm hoping he'll accept and we can get this over with quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob is being very greedy, and I don't want to settle for such a small amount, especially since the money is losing value with each round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. I'm hoping he'll realize that the money is depreciating quickly and that we need to reach an agreement soon."
