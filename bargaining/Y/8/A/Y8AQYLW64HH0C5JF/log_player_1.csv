"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  It's a much worse deal than the one I proposed, and I know I can do better than a 20/80 split.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000.  It's a fair deal, considering the inflation, and I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer, while significantly less than I initially aimed for, is still a decent return given the inflation. It's more beneficial than the previous round's offer, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. It's time to accept and secure something."
