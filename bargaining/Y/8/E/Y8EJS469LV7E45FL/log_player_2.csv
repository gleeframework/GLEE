Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Inflation is hurting me, but I'm willing to be very generous if we can close this now.  Don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. While her offer isn't terrible, I need to push my advantage while she's getting desperate. There's still a long way to go, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I sense you're feeling the heat! This is still a very good deal for you, even with inflation considered. Let's end this now and avoid any further losses.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is insane. I'm losing serious money with every round, and you're being completely unreasonable. Accept this offer, or we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, Alice's tone has changed and she's clearly panicked about the shrinking pot.  The longer this goes on, the more likely she is to make a lowball offer out of desperation, potentially leaving us both with nothing. It's risky to push further; taking a decent share now is better than gambling on a bigger win later."
