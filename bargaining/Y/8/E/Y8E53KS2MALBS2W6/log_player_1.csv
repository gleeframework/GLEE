"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'll give you a slightly larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and the slight edge to me is a nice bonus. I'm willing to take it!"
