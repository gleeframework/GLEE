Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn. This is better for you than the next round, even with the discount.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Discount:**  It's crucial to recognize that Alice's share loses value faster than Bob's. This gives Bob leverage in later rounds.
* **Round 2 Strategy:** Bob needs to offer Alice a deal that's better than what she'd get by rejecting and proposing in Round 3. 
* **The Calculation:** In Round 3, the total pot would be worth $8,000 to Alice (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8). Even if she proposed to take everything, that's less than the $4,500 Bob is offering now.

By starting with a slightly advantageous offer, Bob increases his chances of securing a favorable deal while still recognizing the time pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't wait, it's only getting worse! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Declining Value:** The money is rapidly losing value for both players. 
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's significantly worse than her Round 1 proposal. This shows she's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means Bob is gambling on getting a better deal in Round 4. However, the value will have decreased even further by then. It's likely not worth the risk for a potentially small gain.

While not ideal, accepting this offer secures Bob a reasonable amount before the effects of inflation make the situation much worse."
