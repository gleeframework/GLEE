Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than last time. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  The deal is getting worse for both of us. This is the same offer you made, but now it hurts us both more than it would have in round one.  Let's be smart and take it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Even though it's the same offer as round 1, the value is deteriorating rapidly. Accepting now is better than risking a worse offer or getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
