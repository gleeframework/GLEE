"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, considering the money will decrease in value with each round.  Let's be reasonable, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update, Bob!

I'll think about it for a moment... Considering the money is worth 20% less now, I'd rather aim for a higher share. Your offer is a bit more even, but I'm not sure it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, the total value is now $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This way, I'll have a slight edge, but we'll still be close.""
}
```"
