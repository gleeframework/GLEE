"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't beat this offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of 30 is equivalent to 30 / 0.95 = 31.58 in the first round's value. Still, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, still a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to keep the split relatively fair. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking control! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the offer, my gain of 20 is equivalent to 20 / 0.8626 = 23.18 in the first round's value. Still, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""Giving you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even larger share, hoping that he'll accept this offer and we can finally settle the division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still in the lead! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

Considering the offer, my gain of 15 is equivalent to 15 / 0.7724 = 19.42 in the first round's value. It's getting harder to resist Bob's aggressive offers.

I'll reject this offer for now, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 17,
  ""bob_gain"": 83,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really devastating my potential gains!

Considering the offer, my gain of 2 is equivalent to 2 / 0.6362 = 3.14 in the first round's value. It's getting very difficult to resist Bob's aggressive offers, and I'm running out of time.

  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options, please be merciful!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob almost all of the money, hoping that he'll finally accept this offer and we can settle the division of the money. I'm running out of time and options, and I don't know if I can do any better."
