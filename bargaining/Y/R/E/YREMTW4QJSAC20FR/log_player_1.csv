"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting $60. I think this is a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get less, I'll get more! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""A compromise: I'll give you more, you'll give me more""}

I'm proposing a compromise where I'll take a slightly smaller share of the money, but still get a decent amount. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
