Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that we're both getting a slightly smaller share in each round. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
