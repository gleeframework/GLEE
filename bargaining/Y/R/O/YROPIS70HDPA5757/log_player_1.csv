Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I'm feeling generous, but I want to make sure I get the majority of the money before the inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer.  While it's better than a 10% loss, I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to try a compromise.  I'll offer Bob slightly more than the last round, hoping he'll see it as a good deal and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm getting worried about the inflation! Even though I'm getting less than I would have in the first round, it's better than getting even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer."
