"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's start with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation. We can adjust it in the next round if needed. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 87.5% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 55/45 split. I'd like to propose a 58/42 split in my favor in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share. Let's try 58/42.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, with me getting $5,800 and Bob getting $4,200. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm still willing to compromise."
