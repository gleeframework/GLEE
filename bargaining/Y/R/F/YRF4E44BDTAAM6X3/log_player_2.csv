"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm taking most of the money.  Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's not a good deal for Bob to accept in the first round, considering that the money will lose value with each subsequent round. Bob should try to negotiate a better deal."
