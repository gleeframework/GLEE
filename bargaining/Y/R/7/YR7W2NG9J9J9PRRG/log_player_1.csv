"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob, but considering the time value of money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** I start with a proposal that is relatively close to a 50/50 split. This demonstrates a willingness to be fair and hopefully encourages Bob to negotiate. 
* **Time Value of Money:** The message explicitly acknowledges the impact of inflation on my returns.  This underlines why I'm asking for a slightly larger share, making it clear it's not out of greed.
* **First Mover Advantage:**  While I don't want to be unreasonable, understanding I make the first offer gives me a slight advantage. Bob knows the longer the game goes, the less valuable the money is to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good start, Alice. How about we meet a bit closer to the middle this time? 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's not enough to offset the impact of inflation. Accepting this offer would mean I'm essentially getting a worse deal than my initial proposal in real terms.  I need to push Bob a bit further to reach a truly fair agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming up, Bob, but the clock is ticking. This is a fair offer considering the time value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm increasing my asking amount, but only slightly. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not be walked over.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message reiterates the time pressure, reminding Bob that each round makes the deal worse for me.  
* **Framing:**  By continually calling my offers ""fair"" I'm subtly trying to anchor the negotiation around that concept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm offering you the same amount you wanted last round.  It's a deal that makes sense for both of us given the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but strategically, it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The 14.26% decrease due to inflation is significant. While Bob is offering the same nominal amount as my last ask, in real terms, it's worth considerably less than my original proposal.
* **Reaching the Limit:** It's unlikely Bob will move much further, and further rounds will only erode my potential gains. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** Prolonging negotiations with little chance of a significantly better outcome could lead to a stalemate where I end up with even less."
