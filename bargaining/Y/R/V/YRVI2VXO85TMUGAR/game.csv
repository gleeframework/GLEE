70.0,30.0,Let's be reasonable and split the money 70/30. This gives you a decent share and avoids the risk of losing everything with further delays.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I think a 60/40 split is fairer. Let's make a deal and avoid further rounds of risk.,Bob,2,

75.0,25.0,"Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. My 70/30 offer was fair, and your counter-proposal didn't reflect the urgency. I'm willing to compromise slightly with 75/25, but this is my final offer.",Alice,3,
