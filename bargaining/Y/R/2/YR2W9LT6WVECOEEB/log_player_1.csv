"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose keeping most of the money for myself, since I am the one making the offer.  But I'll give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, getting 40% is better than getting nothing if we reach the 12th round.  It's a significant gain compared to the 5% I was initially offered."
