"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice. I'll take the majority share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather have a smaller share now than risk getting less in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
