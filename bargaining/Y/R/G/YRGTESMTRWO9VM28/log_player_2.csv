"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm open to negotiation later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting,  it's best to see what Alice will offer in the future.  The inflation rate will be more beneficial to Bob in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation. We can adjust later if needed.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but we need to find a more balanced split.  This is the best I can do right now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is significantly better than what Bob would get if the game goes on, and the inflation rate will continue to make it worse for Alice.  It's a good time to take the deal."
