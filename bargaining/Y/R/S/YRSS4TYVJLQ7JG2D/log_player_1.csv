"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good starting point, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 1, I had 50, and now due to inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd have 50 * 0.9 = 45.

Bob's offer is 40 for me, which is less than my previous offer of 50. However, considering the inflation, 40 is actually a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
