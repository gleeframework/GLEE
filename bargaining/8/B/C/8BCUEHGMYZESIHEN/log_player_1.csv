I'm going to be greedy in the first round. I want to see if Bob will be agreeable to a very uneven split.  We'll see how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair deal. It's much better than getting nothing!  I'll take it."
