"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script, huh?

I'll think for a moment... Considering the money is worth 5% less than before, I'd rather get a bigger share now to make up for the loss in value.

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
