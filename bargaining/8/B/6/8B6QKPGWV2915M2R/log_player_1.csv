"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think it's fair, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than that. The money is worth less with each passing round, so I'm not willing to give up as much as Bob is asking for. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make a deal?""
}
```

I've reduced my gain by $300 to try to reach a compromise, while still keeping a slight edge. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want more 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to squeeze more out of me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than I did in the previous round. I'll stick to my previous offer and wait for Bob to meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Let's finalize this!""
}
```

I've reduced my gain by another $200, but I'm not budging much more than that. I'm trying to put some pressure on Bob to accept this offer."
