Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more even split.  Let's be fair, and remember the value of money decreases with each round.  I'm willing to share more to avoid risking getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
