"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested in negotiating.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable. It avoids any risk of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a 50/50 split as I was in the first round. Since my gain would be worth 20% less than the initial $8000, I'd actually be getting $6400. However, I'm not sure about Bob's gain, so I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll try to get a better deal. Since my gain would be worth 20% less than the initial $8000, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```"
