Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting *something* rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal for me than getting nothing in the end.  While I'd prefer more, it's not worth the risk of losing everything."
