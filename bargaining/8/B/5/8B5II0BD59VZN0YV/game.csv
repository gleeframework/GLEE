55.0,45.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 55/45.  We can adjust later if needed.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a good starting point, Alice.  However, since you'll be losing value at a slower rate than me if we go to later rounds, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile.  How about we reverse the split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's meet in the middle.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option given the inflation.  We both lose less this way.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Okay, Alice, I understand the need to compromise. How about a 52/48 split? It's closer to the middle ground, but still acknowledges the faster rate of inflation affecting my share.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
