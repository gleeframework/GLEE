"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share this time, but I'm open to negotiating in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1,000, it's important to remember that there are 12 rounds and the money will be worth less each time.  Rejecting gives me a chance to make a better offer later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split. I believe this is fair, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future.""}
