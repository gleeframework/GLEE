"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. The message ""Let's be fair"" is meant to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This offer won't be as good in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth less to Bob in each subsequent round, he may be more willing to compromise and give me a larger share in order to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Additionally, while Bob's offer of a 45-55 split is more generous than my initial offer, I still think I can negotiate for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 57-43 split, with me getting $57 and Bob getting $43. Since Bob's previous offer was a 45-55 split, I'm trying to meet him in the middle by offering a compromise that is closer to his proposal than my initial offer. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" is meant to convey a sense of compromise and cooperation, and to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
