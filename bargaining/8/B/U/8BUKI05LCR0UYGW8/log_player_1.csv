"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. This ensures a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is much worse for me than the previous round. It's not worth accepting at this point. I'll propose a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000/300,000 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still leaves me with a significant portion of the money, especially considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although my share is significantly less than what I initially proposed, the inflation is now too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least some money, while rejecting it risks getting nothing due to further inflation."
