"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets 30%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first to make a proposal and I don't know how Bob will react."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 38$ (95% of 40$). Bob's gain of 60$ is worth 48$ (80% of 60$).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept it.
