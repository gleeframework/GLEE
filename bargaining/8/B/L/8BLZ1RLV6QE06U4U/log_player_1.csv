Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you wanting a slight advantage for the first offer, but it needs to be fair. Let's swap amounts and settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
