"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose Alice receives $850,000 and Bob receives $150,000.  Since we both lost money due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise slightly by increasing Bob's share while still maintaining a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is far too low for me. While Bob has lost more value due to inflation, his proposed share is still significantly higher than mine. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I propose Alice receives $750,000 and Bob receives $250,000.  I am willing to decrease my share further to demonstrate my commitment to a resolution, but I believe this split is still fair considering the significant inflation we are both experiencing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than previous rounds, the inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly. I am not comfortable accepting such a small share, especially considering the larger loss he is experiencing. I will continue to strive for a more equitable division in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I propose Alice receives $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000. We are both facing significant losses due to inflation, but this offer is a compromise that recognizes the growing disparity in our losses while still providing Bob with a reasonable share."
