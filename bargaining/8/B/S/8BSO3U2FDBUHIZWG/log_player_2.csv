"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives you a good chunk while recognizing my advantage in the early rounds. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money loses value over time, and I lose more value than Alice, I should try to end the game as soon as possible. However, Alice's offer doesn't seem generous enough to make me want to end the game this early. I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round. Keep in mind that as the rounds go on, the money will be worth less, but I'm willing to take that risk to try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money loses value faster for me, I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need a bit more than your initial offer.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this round, I've increased my share to $450,000, hoping that Alice will see this as a more reasonable offer and accept it. Since the money loses value faster for me, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and ending the game quickly. I've also included a message to Alice explaining my reasoning, in the hopes that she'll see things from my perspective and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is decreasing, but yours should decrease faster. This split still favors you in the long run. Let's be realistic about the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money is losing value rapidly, especially for me, I still believe that accepting $400,000 in the third round might not be the best option. Alice's offer has decreased, but considering the faster rate at which the money loses value for me, I'm inclined to push for a slightly better deal. The difference in the rate of value loss between us means that, over time, her share effectively increases more than mine decreases in real value. I'll reject this offer, hoping that in the next round, I can either get a better deal or make an offer that Alice can't refuse.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure, but given the difference in how the money's value decreases for us, I think this split is more reasonable. It's a bit higher than my last offer, but I'm trying to account for the faster depreciation on my end. Let's settle this before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Considering the increasing pressure from inflation and the fact that I lose more value over time, I've decided to make an offer that slightly increases my share from the previous round. This is a strategic move, aiming to appear more reasonable while also accounting for the disproportionate loss in value I'm experiencing. By explaining my reasoning to Alice, I hope she'll understand the urgency and the fairness of my offer, leading her to accept it and end the game before the value of the money drops further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a point where the shrinking pie makes this pointless for both of us. This is my final offer above 550,000. Take it or watch your potential gains dwindle even faster. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, but especially for me, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The threat of watching my potential gains dwindle even faster is real, and Alice has indicated that this is her final offer above $550,000. Continuing to reject offers in hopes of a better deal seems increasingly risky, as the value of the money is dropping rapidly. Accepting $430,000 now, even though it's worth 59.04% less than in the first round, might be the best option to ensure I walk away with something substantial. Further rounds could lead to the money becoming nearly worthless, making this a pragmatic decision under the circumstances."
