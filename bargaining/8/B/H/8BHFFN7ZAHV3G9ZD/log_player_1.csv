"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $200,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I like the idea of splitting it evenly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""accept""
}"
