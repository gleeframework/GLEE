"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your split seems a bit unfair considering the inflation. How about this slightly adjusted offer?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favors her. It's in Bob's best interest to reject and propose something more balanced, considering the inflation working against him.
* **Counter-offer:** 
    *  A 4800/5200 split is still advantageous to Alice in the long run due to the inflation difference, making it more likely she'll accept. 
    *  The message aims to frame the offer as a compromise and appeal to a sense of fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has improved slightly, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially when considering the rapidly increasing inflation for Bob.  It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially given the inflation we both face. Let's end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the inflation significantly erodes Bob's potential gains. A more assertive approach is needed.
* **Fairness Appeal:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. By framing this as his ""final offer,"" Bob adds weight to his proposal. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the shared experience of inflation, hopefully pushing Alice to accept a reasonable deal now rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
