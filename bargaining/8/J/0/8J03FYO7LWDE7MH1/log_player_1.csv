Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob $1000. I think this is a fair offer, as it gives him a small amount of money, but still leaves me with the majority of the share.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, as I don't want to risk losing money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation means my offer is now worth less, and Bob's offer is likely the best I can get. It's better to accept and get something rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
