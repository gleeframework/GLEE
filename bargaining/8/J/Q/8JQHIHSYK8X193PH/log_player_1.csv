This seems like a good starting point.  I'm being very generous to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end this quickly.  After all, inflation is a real threat!  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'd prefer more of the money, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Inflation is a serious threat, and Bob's offer is at least fair. It's better to accept now and secure half the money than risk getting nothing in the future."
