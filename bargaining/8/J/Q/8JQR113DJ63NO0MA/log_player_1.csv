"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation will eat into our earnings with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away the entire fortune! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation, isn't he?

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still confident I can get a better deal than this. Don't be stingy, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, considering the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal. You're not getting the better end of this deal yet! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 49-51 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced deal, considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round."
