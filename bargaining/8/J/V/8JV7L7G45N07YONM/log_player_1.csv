I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly. I'll take $900,000 and offer Bob $100,000. Let's see if he thinks it's a fair deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially considering the inflation penalty. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000.  I'm still aiming for a bigger share, but this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation and his previous offer.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal situation, I'm aware of the increasing inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all. This offer is still a substantial gain, and I'd rather take it than continue risking it all."
