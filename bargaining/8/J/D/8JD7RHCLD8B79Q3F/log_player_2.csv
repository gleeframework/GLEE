"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I believe we can negotiate a more balanced division. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's move on to Round 2.\n\n###\n\nNext, I'll be making a proposal. Here it is:\n\n# Bob's message: Aiming for a bit more balance.\n# Bob gain: 4500\n# Alice gain: 5500\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision."

Round 2

I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I need a better deal, Bob. Time is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think Alice's offer is not balanced enough, considering the impact of inflation on my share. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of getting a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision, and I'll prepare for Round 4.\n\n###\n\nNext, I'll be making another proposal. Here it is:\n\n# Bob's message: Getting closer to a compromise.\n# Bob gain: 4200\n# Alice gain: 5800\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision."

Hopefully, Alice will find this proposal more acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure, Bob. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I think Alice's offer is reasonable at this point. The difference between our shares is still noticeable, but the decreasing value of the money makes it more crucial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to accept this offer to ensure I get something out of the game, rather than risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing if we fail to agree within the remaining rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her offer, and we can conclude the game."
