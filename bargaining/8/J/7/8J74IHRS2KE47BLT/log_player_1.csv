"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me $999,000 and Bob $1,000. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as even though it's a small amount for him, it's better than nothing. If he rejects it, the inflation will kick in, making it even more difficult to get a fair deal in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous proposal, it's still not a fair division. Inflation has devalued my gains, but I'm not ready to accept such a lopsided arrangement. I believe I can still secure a more equitable share if I make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Inflation has made the game less favorable for both of us, so I believe a fair and equal division is the best way to end this round."
