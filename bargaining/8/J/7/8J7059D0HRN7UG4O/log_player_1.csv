"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair and equal share of the money."

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than 40% of the original amount, while still leaving some room for Bob to accept the offer."

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than 60% of the original amount, which I think is a fair compromise considering the inflation."

# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this deal, as it's getting closer to a 60/40 split, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the future."
