"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me.  Let's meet in the middle - this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
This offer is slightly better for Bob than the first, and worse for me. I think I can get a better deal if I hold out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Okay, let's try this. I recognize the need to be fair, but time is money!  This offer benefits us both.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is the fairest offer and it benefits us both equally. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This offer is now close enough to an even split after inflation. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, whereas continuing the negotiations carries a significant risk that we won't reach an agreement and both get nothing."
