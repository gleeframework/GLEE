Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money's value has decreased by 20% each round, so it's now worth 36% less than in the first round. This means the actual value of the $100 is $64.

### Step 2: Review previous offers and decisions
In Round 1, Alice offered a 50/50 split, which I rejected. In Round 2, I offered a 60/40 split in my favor, which Alice rejected. In Round 3, Alice offered a 45/55 split, again in her favor, which I also rejected.

### Step 3: Determine the next offer
Given the decreasing value of the money and the previous offers, I need to consider how to balance my desire for a larger share with the risk of further devaluation if the game continues. Since Alice has shown willingness to adjust her offer but still wants a larger share, I should aim for a compromise that reflects the current value of the money and is more likely to be accepted.

### Step 4: Calculate the new offer
Considering the money's current value and aiming for a compromise, I'll offer a split that slightly favors me but is closer to Alice's last offer than my previous one. A 52/48 split could be seen as a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value and the need to reach an agreement before the money loses more value.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message
I will offer a 52/48 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Alice to accept this compromise given the decreasing value of the money and the benefits of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle before the money loses more value. This is a fair compromise.""}"
