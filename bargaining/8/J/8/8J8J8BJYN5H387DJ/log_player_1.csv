I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,500, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still significantly less than what I offered in the first round.  This reflects the inflation impact on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm still not happy with this offer, even with the inflation penalty. I need to see a more equitable distribution of the funds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

Given the inflation, I'm offering Bob $2,500, which is still more than his last offer, but significantly less than what I originally offered. This is my final offer, and if it's rejected, I'm prepared to accept the consequences of the next round."
