"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 45 dollars and keep 55 dollars for myself. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly, as we're both playing the game. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 5% less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 48 dollars and keep 52 dollars for myself. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'm willing to compromise a bit. My message to Bob suggests meeting in the middle, hoping he'll accept this revised offer. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle and avoid further losses to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer of an even split. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money, so I'll settle for 50 dollars. It's time to end the game!"
