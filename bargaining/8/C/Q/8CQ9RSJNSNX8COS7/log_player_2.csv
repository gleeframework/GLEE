Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice claims to be compromising, the offer is barely better than her previous one considering the rapid devaluation of her share.  We're now past the halfway point, and Alice needs to understand the urgency.  It's time to push a bit harder and see if we can get a more favorable response in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer now, or we risk walking away with nothing!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't be intimidated 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's time to be realistic.  Alice is clearly digging in her heels, and the value of the money is plummeting. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll walk away with even less in the remaining rounds. This isn't ideal, but it's better than nothing."
