"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
This offer is designed to maximize my gain while giving Bob a minimal amount. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to ensure I get as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it's a significant improvement from Bob's first offer, I believe I can still get a better deal. Inflation is only affecting Bob's gains, so I have the advantage in negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 90 for myself, giving Bob a small increase to 10. This is still heavily in my favor, and I'm hoping this will be enough for Bob to accept, considering the inflation is working against him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is starting to feel the effects of inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. The offer is still significantly lower than my previous proposals, and I'm confident I can secure a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to get closer to a deal. While inflation is working against Bob, he's still likely to accept this offer as it's better than his previous offer. I'm confident this is a good balance between maximizing my gain and avoiding another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. Bob is clearly feeling the effects of inflation, and his offers are getting progressively worse. While it's not my ideal split, it's better than risking further rejection and ending up with nothing."
