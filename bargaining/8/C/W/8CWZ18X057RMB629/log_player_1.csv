"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer!""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the total amount and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest way, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer and got a worse deal. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal after considering the initial offer I made.""}

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, with me getting 60% of the total amount and Bob getting 40%."
