"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob would get the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $8000 I would get in the first round is now worth less, and the $2000 Bob would get is also worth less, but I don't know the exact effect on Bob's side.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a slightly more generous offer than the previous one, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is becoming less valuable, and I need to adjust my strategy.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. I don't think I can do better than a 40-60 split, and the money is becoming increasingly worthless.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
