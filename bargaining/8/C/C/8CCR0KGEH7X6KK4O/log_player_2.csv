Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her offer, hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress and the inflation eats into my potential gains. However, 40% after inflation is still a significant loss. I need to hold my ground a bit longer to show I'm serious about a fairer split."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the circumstances. Let's end this now before inflation hurts us both further.""}"
