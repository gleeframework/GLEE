"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10 and keeping $90 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to consider accepting the offer and ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I think I deserve more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to calculate the actual value of the offer in the first round's currency, which is $100. Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the equivalent value of Bob's offer is:

$50 * (1 / 0.9) = $55.56

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in the third round, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself, hoping that this will be more attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. You're getting a bit greedy, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less in the fourth round, I'll need to calculate the actual value of the offer in the first round's currency. Since the money is worth 27.1% less, the equivalent value of Bob's offer is:

$55 * (1 / 0.713) = $77.01

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less in the fifth round, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself, hoping that this will be more attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about dividing the money fairly, Alice. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 40.95% less in the sixth round, I'll need to calculate the actual value of the offer in the first round's currency. Since the money is worth 40.95% less, the equivalent value of Bob's offer is:

$60 * (1 / 0.596) = $100.83

I'm surprised that Bob's offer is actually equivalent to more than the original $100! I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and take the higher value.
