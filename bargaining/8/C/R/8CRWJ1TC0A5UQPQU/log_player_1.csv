"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see how the negotiations go!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and inviting Bob to consider my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the proposal this round! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, especially considering the decreasing value of money. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 5% decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more than last round!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 200 dollars, but still keeping the ratio close to the previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more since I've been rejecting your offers and it's my turn to make a proposal again! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gain! With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very careful with my decision.

Considering the decreased value of money and Bob's previous rejections, I'm not convinced that this offer is the best I can get. I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant decrease in the value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to protect my interests considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 300 dollars from the previous offer, trying to account for the decreasing value of money. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
