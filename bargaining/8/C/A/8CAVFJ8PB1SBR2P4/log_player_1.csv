"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the reduced value of money, I'm not as keen on giving up 60% of the remaining $100. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal to make up for the lost value. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a risk, Bob. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. We're both losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up. With the reduced value of money, an even split seems like a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
