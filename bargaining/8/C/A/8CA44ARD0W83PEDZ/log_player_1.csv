"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can have 60. It's a fair deal, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this case, I'd rather have 40 dollars worth 90% of what it was in the first round than 60 dollars worth 90% of what it was in the first round. So, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
