Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though I'm getting less than I initially proposed, the inflation means it's not worth risking another round and potentially getting nothing at all.  A 50/50 split is fair in this situation."
