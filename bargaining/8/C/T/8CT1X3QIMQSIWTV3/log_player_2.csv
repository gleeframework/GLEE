Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hurting us both, so a 50/50 split feels fairer. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, accepting the 50/50 split seems like the best option to maximize my take-home value."
