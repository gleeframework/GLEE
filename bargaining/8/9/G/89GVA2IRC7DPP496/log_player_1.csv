Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the offer! Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering inflation. I'll take it!"
