Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a tiny amount to avoid playing another round and the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is a good deal considering the inflation risk.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
