Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, but 52.5/47.5 is still not good enough for me. How about we meet closer to my original offer? 58/42 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is sticking close to her original offer and taking advantage of my willingness to negotiate. It's important to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal, and not just desperate to avoid getting zero.  We still have time, and the pressure from inflation will increase."
