"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the time pressure, but a 60/40 split isn't fair to me.  How about we meet closer to the middle with a 55/45 split? This ensures we both benefit significantly from this opportunity. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
