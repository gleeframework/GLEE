Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value decreases rapidly for you. Let's be pragmatic.  My 60/40 offer was fair, this is a compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer isn't ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob). Rejecting this offer and going to another round carries a significant risk:

* **Further Value Reduction:**  Another round means the money is worth even less to me.
* **Alice's Potential Offer:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even offer less, putting me in a worse position.

Accepting the current offer, while not perfect, guarantees a reasonable sum that's better than risking a much lower amount if I continue to hold out."
