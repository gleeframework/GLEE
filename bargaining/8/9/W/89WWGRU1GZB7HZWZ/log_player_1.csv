"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent amount to make the game interesting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I want to keep pushing for a better deal, as my gain is still worth less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, so I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With the money being worth only 51.2% of its original value, I need to be careful. However, Bob's offer is a bit more balanced than my previous offer, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the offer and divide the money with Bob."
