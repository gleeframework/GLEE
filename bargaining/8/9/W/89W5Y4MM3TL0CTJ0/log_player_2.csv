"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose we split the money 60/40. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 40%. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, 55/45?""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to get a bit more than half to make up for the loss. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer before the money loses more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution.  Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, a 50/50 split is a good deal for me at this point. The money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, but it's still a better option than risking another round and losing more value. I'll accept Alice's offer and end the game here."
