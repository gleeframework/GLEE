"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth $400,000 in real terms.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob an equal share, especially since he rejected my initial offer. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, since 20% has been eroded by inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $440,000, but I think I deserve a bit more considering I made the first offer.""
}
```"
