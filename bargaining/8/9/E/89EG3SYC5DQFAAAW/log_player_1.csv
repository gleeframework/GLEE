"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm looking for a more balanced split, and this offer is still too skewed towards Bob. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think this is a fairer split""}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
