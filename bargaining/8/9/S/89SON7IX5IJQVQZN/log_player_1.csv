I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, considering Bob's money will depreciate faster than mine.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though my share is smaller, it's still more than I would have received if we had continued to the next round. The inflation will hurt Bob more than me, so I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
