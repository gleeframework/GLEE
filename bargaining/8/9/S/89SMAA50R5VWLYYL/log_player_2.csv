"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both agree on this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a fair split now, I know that inflation is going to hurt my share of the money in the future.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less this time, Alice, but I think this is a fairer split considering the impact of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm going to accept this offer.  While it's still not as good as my initial proposal, inflation has already eroded my potential gains.  I need to secure something before the value drops even further."
