"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, but I'll need to be more assertive if Bob rejects this.  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept that offer.  It's a little bit insulting to be offered such a small amount of money after I proposed such a generous offer! I will make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share a bit to try and reach a compromise, but I'm still keeping a majority.  Bob's offer was completely unreasonable, and I'm not going to be bullied into accepting anything less than what I believe is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still extremely unfair, and I'm not going to accept it.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still holding firm on my belief that I deserve the majority of the money, but I'm willing to negotiate.  This is a fair offer considering how much the money is losing value each round.  Hopefully Bob will see reason and accept this."
