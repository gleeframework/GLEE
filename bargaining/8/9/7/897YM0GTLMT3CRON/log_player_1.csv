"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point, and leaving 40% for Bob. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation in the previous rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer and accept it."
