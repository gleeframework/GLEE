"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was a fair split, I'm offering a 50/50 split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the $5,000 I would gain is actually worth 80% of the initial $5,000, which is $4,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's a 50/50 split, and I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent amount of money. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
