"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a better deal than the 50-50 split I initially proposed, considering the reduced value of the money."
