"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40-60 split. I'd like to propose something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value, so I need to be even more strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems like a fair compromise to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth only 51.2% of its original value, so I need to be even more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to end the game with a relatively fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take 5000$. It's a decent compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
