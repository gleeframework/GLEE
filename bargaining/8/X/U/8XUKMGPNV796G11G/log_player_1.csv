"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to adjust my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll consider the effective values.

My gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually worth $3600.
Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually worth $5700.

Considering the effective values, I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting less than I initially proposed in the first round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share this round to compensate for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation.

My gain of $3000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's actually worth $2187.
Bob's gain of $7000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's actually worth $6715.

Considering the effective values, I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting less than I initially proposed in the first round.
