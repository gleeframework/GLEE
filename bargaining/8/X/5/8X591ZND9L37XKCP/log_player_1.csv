I'm going to start with a pretty uneven split. I want to see how greedy Bob is.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round if he rejects this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too uneven.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This time I'm offering a more balanced split.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in settling before the money shrinks further."
