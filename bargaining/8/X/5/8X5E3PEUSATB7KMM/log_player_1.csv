Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $900,000 and give $100,000 to Bob.  I want to start with a fair-ish offer, but keep the bulk of the money for myself. We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. It's a very lopsided deal in his favor, and even with the inflation penalty, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll propose a more equitable split this time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

This time I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's still a good amount for me, but I'm hoping it's enough to incentivize Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of inflation."
