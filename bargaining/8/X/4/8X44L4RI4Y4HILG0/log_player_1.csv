"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer given the initial amount of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect us differently. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is a 50-50 split in terms of the original amount, I'll accept it. The inflation will still affect me more, but I'll take the deal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
