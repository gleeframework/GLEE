"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less than before. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm not willing to give up 2/3 of the money.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation taking its toll, my share is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer, trying to account for the reduced value of money.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my share, and I need to adjust my strategy. Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll think about Bob's offer...

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking losing more value in subsequent rounds.
