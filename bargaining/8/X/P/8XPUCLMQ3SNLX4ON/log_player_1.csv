Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think a 50/50 split is the best way to go.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'd actually be getting less value than initially proposed. I'll take my chances and make another offer in the next round."

# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to get worried about inflation, but I still believe a fair split is possible.  Let's compromise - I'll take 55% and you can have 45%.  This way, we can both get a good share of the money before it depreciates too much. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although the money is losing value due to inflation, Bob's proposal gives me an even smaller share than before. I'll make another offer in the next round to try and get a better deal.

# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time!  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to 52.5% so we can both get a decent amount before the money is worth nothing. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the rapid depreciation of the money's value due to inflation, I think it's wise to settle on this deal. Bob's offer is relatively fair, and I don't want to risk losing everything if we can't agree within the remaining rounds.
