**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the value of her potential winnings plummets.  While this offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. We're past the halfway point, and she'll be feeling the pressure soon. I'm betting she'll make a much more appealing offer in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. This is getting ridiculous. 50/50 is the only fair deal at this point. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and every round sees a significant decrease in value, especially for Alice.  The longer this goes on, the less appealing any deal becomes.
* **Shifting Power Dynamic:** By consistently rejecting her offers and remaining firm, I'm demonstrating my willingness to walk away. The rapidly declining value for Alice puts more pressure on her to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Straightforwardness:**  A 50/50 split is the simplest and arguably fairest solution. It eliminates any further haggling and sends a clear message that I'm done negotiating."
