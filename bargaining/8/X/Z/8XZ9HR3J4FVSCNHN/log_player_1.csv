"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but it's still fair since Bob gets something. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as he's likely to get less in future rounds due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best choice for me.  I'm losing money due to inflation with each passing round, and if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will be generous in the next round.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
