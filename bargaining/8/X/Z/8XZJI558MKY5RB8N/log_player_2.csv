"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation makes it a bad deal for me (Bob) in the long run. I'm willing to negotiate, but this starting offer isn't in my best interest."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation makes your offer risky for me. This is more balanced, considering the long game."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is barely budging while she's losing value much faster than me. This tells me she's overestimating her position. I need to signal I'm willing to wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The longer this goes, the less we both get. I'm offering you a decent share, but I need you to meet me halfway."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but it's too slow. The inflation is eating away at her share far faster than mine. I need to hold firm and make it clear that time is on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
