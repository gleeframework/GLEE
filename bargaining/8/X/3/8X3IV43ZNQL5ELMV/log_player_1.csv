"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going for a high-stakes, aggressive first offer. I want to see if Bob is risk-averse and will accept even a small amount, or if he's willing to play the long game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair and equal split. It's a good outcome for me, and accepting this offer avoids the risk of getting nothing if the game goes on."
