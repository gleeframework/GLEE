"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly gesture to encourage Bob to consider my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to divide fairly, but inflation hurts you more than me. This offer gives us both a better deal in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer may seem reasonable at first glance, considering the impact of inflation, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since inflation affects me more than Bob, I'm incentivized to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I'm not ready to accept an offer that gives Bob the larger share. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm making a concession from my original offer, but still aiming for a slightly larger share to account for the increased impact of inflation on my gains. By suggesting ""meet me in the middle,"" I'm framing this offer as a compromise between our previous proposals, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice, and the deal is getting worse for you every round.  I'm offering a favorable split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's message emphasizes the time pressure and the impact of inflation, I'm not convinced that this offer is as ""favorable"" as he claims. Considering the increasing disparity in the value of our gains due to inflation, I'm willing to take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to find a more acceptable compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal""}\n\nI'm making a more significant concession, considering the increasing impact of inflation on my gains. By framing this offer as the ""last chance for a fair deal,"" I'm trying to convey a sense of urgency and fairness, hoping to persuade Bob to accept this compromise. This offer is closer to a 50-50 split, which I believe is a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
