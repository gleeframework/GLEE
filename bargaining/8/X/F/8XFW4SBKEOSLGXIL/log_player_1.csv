Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was unfair. Let's be reasonable, I'll take 60 and you get 40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit with this offer, but let's end this. 55 for me, 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation on his returns. While his offer seems like a small concession, the longer this goes on, the less valuable his share becomes. I'm willing to push him further to secure a better split for myself."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear you're feeling the heat of inflation. This is my final offer: $60 for me, $40 for you. Take it before it's worth even less!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on Bob now.  He's seeing his potential gains dwindle rapidly. This offer is a good balance between maximizing my share and ensuring Bob sees it as his last chance to salvage a reasonable amount."
