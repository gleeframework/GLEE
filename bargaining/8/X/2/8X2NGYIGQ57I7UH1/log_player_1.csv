"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  50/50 is a good start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll get 50% of $100 x 0.8 = $80.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
