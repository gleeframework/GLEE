"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Alice, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Alice's offer, I'm still getting a slightly lower amount than I proposed in the previous round, but I think it's a good opportunity to take a smaller share now and avoid further losses due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
