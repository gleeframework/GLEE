"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I know Bob's money will depreciate faster than mine. This should be a good starting point for a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair but not particularly advantageous to me. However, I believe I can still get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. While Bob's money depreciates faster, I'm willing to give him a little more to avoid another round of negotiation and the potential for a worse outcome due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though this is a worse deal for me than the previous round, Bob's offer is still better than the outcome of continuing the game. My money has depreciated significantly, and while Bob's offer is not great, it's the best I can get at this point. Accepting is the most logical choice."
