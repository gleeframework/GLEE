"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal as the game progresses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to be more cautious. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
