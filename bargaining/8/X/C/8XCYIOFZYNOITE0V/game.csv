70.0,30.0,"Let's start with this fair offer, Bob. A 70/30 split seems reasonable considering the inflation working against you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I think we can do better than a 70/30 split.  Let's start with a more even 60/40.  This offers a better starting point for both of us and allows for more flexibility as we continue through the rounds.,Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, you are losing money fast!  That 60/40 split would be a terrible deal for you in a couple more rounds. Let's be realistic, 65/35 is my final offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, we need to be mindful of the inflation.  This 65/35 split won't be viable for me much longer.  Let's compromise at 45/55.  This will give us both a decent share, while acknowledging the decreasing value of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, it's clear you're feeling the heat of the inflation.  I'm willing to come down slightly to 60/40, but this is absolutely my final offer. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking!",Alice,5,
