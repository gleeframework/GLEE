Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI will reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but 19% less to Alice, I have more negotiating power. I'll try to make a more favorable offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger share since the money is worth less to you now.""}\n\n###\nI'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money to Alice. Since the money is worth 19% less to her, I'll try to get a bigger share. I'll offer 65 to myself and 35 to Alice, with a message explaining my reasoning."
