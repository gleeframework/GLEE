"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still slightly more favorable to him, I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that's more favorable to me. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still a significant amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6400 
# Bob gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","With the rapid inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him, but I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
