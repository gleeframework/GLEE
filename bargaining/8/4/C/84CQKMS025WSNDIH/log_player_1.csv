"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected the 50/50 split, so I'm taking a more assertive approach. I'm offering a 7/3 split, which is still a generous offer considering the rejection. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 7/3 split, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is being more assertive.
