"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, 50/50. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is a perfectly fair division, I see no reason to reject this offer and risk potentially getting a worse deal in a future round. Accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000, which is a reasonable share of the $10,000.\n\n###"
