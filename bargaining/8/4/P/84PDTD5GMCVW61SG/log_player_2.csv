Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a fair deal, take it before inflation eats away at it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, hoping I'll panic as inflation eats into my potential gains. However, $440,000 after inflation is a really bad deal. I need to push for a more agreeable split quickly, or I risk getting even less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Don't let greed make us both losers.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is getting severe.  It's time to make a strong stand for a fair deal.  A 50/50 split is the most logical and equitable outcome. Emphasizing that greed could hurt us both might sway Alice towards a sensible agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 offer was close, but I think I deserve a bit more. Consider this 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Ideally, I wanted a 50/50 split. However, with inflation eating away at my potential gains each round,  $460,000 is better than risking an even lower offer from Alice as we get closer to the deadline. It's not perfect, but it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
