"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant advantage but still leaves Bob with a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 92 
# Bob gain: 8 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is less generous than my initial proposal, it's still a significant gain for me, and I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation.  Accepting this offer secures a large portion of the money."
