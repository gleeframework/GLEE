Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's not how we start, Alice. I'm being more than fair here, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with the rounds progressing, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm willing to take a slight hit to push for a more equitable split as the devaluation will hurt him more in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting desperate, but his offer is still not reflective of the increasing devaluation. I need to hold strong and make it clear that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
