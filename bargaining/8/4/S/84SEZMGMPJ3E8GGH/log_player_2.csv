Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. She's barely budging from her initial offer while my potential gains are steadily decreasing. Holding out might force her to make a more serious offer in the next round, especially as we approach the halfway point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a fair split that saves us both from losing out to inflation.  We're past the halfway point - it's time to make a deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out. Alice is stubbornly refusing to offer a fair deal. While accepting this means I'm losing out compared to earlier rounds, rejecting it risks us running out of rounds and getting nothing. It's better to take a smaller share now than gamble on getting nothing at all."
