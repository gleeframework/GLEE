"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I now have to consider a 5% decrease in value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept it since I'll get $50, which is worth less than my initial proposal of $80. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, and I need to make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is worth 10% less than my initial proposal of $80, and I'm keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's call it a day and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to bite! With my gain worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gain now. With my gain worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is the best I can do. Let's finalize it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $35, which is worth 56.25% of the initial $100 (due to the cumulative inflation effect), and I'm keeping $65 for myself. It's a bit of a risk, but I think it's the best I can get at this point."
