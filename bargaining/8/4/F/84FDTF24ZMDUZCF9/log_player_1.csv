"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take 999,000 and leave Bob with 1,000.  This is a safe starting point for me, and gives Bob some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, I'm not sure how the inflation will affect me in later rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount."
