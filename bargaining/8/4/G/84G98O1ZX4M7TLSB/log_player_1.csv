"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
