Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I'm going for a large share initially, hoping to get a good deal in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's more than the 5% inflation decrease, it's still significantly less than my initial offer. I'm willing to gamble on a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will find agreeable.  I'm still willing to take a significant portion of the money, but I'm also acknowledging that I need to be flexible to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting a significantly smaller share than I initially hoped for, with the 14.26% inflation, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something. I'm taking a loss, but it's the most logical choice given the circumstances."
