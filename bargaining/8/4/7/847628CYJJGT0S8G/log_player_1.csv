"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k, you can try to do better next round""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you can still do better! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I can accept an offer that gives me only $300,000, especially considering the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more, can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll try to squeeze out a better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, especially considering the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to what I want, meet me at 50/50 or I'll keep pushing for more""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a more equal split, but I'm also leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
