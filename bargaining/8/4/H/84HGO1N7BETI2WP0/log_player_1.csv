"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, I'll give you a chance to do better next round""
}
```

This way, I get 90$ and Bob gets 10$. I'm hoping Bob will decline and I'll get to make the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my expectations.

In this round, the actual values are:
Alice gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54
Bob gain: 40

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's not terrible either. I'll decide to accept the offer, hoping to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
