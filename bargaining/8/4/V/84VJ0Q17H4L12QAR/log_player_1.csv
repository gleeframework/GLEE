"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the actual amounts, not the percentage.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer, as I'll be gaining $6,000 (not $2,000) and Bob will be gaining $6,400 (not $8,000).
