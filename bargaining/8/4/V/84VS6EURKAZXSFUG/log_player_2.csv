"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Even though the offer is less than Alice's first offer, it's still better than my previous offer which was rejected.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject this offer, I'll have to make an offer in the next round. However, inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money, and Alice might not accept my offer. 

It's risky to keep rejecting offers when inflation is working against me."
