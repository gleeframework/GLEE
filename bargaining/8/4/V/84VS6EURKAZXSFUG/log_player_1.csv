"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, but I'm aiming to get the higher amount to set a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to flip the script and get the higher amount now. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is actually worth less than $6000 was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
