Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice's offers are unlikely to favor me more as time goes on due to the inflation working against her.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, even with the inflation disparity, is a fair outcome in these circumstances.

Waiting longer might force me to accept a worse deal out of desperation."
