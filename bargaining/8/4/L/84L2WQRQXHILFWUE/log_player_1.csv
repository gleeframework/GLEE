Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 990,000$ and let Bob have 10,000$.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it allows me to get the majority of the money while still giving Bob something. I'm confident that I can do better in the next round if he rejects my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though I'm losing 5% of the value of the money, I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob is proposing a 50/50 split, and I'm sure I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000. While I want to secure a larger share,  I'm willing to compromise to avoid risking losing even more due to inflation in the next round."
