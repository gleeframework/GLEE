"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this early in the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, taking 400,000 is better than getting nothing.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting and then having Bob propose a worse offer in the next round."
