"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. I believe this offers a fair compromise given the potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject the offer.  While the offer is tempting, I'm hoping to get a larger share in the future rounds. The 20% inflation makes it more advantageous to hold out."
