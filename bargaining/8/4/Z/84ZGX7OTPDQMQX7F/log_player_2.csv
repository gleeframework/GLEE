"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair at first glance, the inflation rates mean Alice is getting a much better deal than I am.  I'll try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 55/45, acknowledging the inflation rates. This gives you a better deal than the last offer, while still leaving me with a significant portion.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is actually less than before. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more than half. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message acknowledges the inflation, the offer still seems too lopsided in her favor.  I'm going to continue pushing for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  With the inflation rates, a 50/50 split is the fairest solution. This avoids any further disagreement and ensures we both get a decent return.""
