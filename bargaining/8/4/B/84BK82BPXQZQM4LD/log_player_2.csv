Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:**  The offer from Alice in round 3 is less favorable to me than her original offer in round 1 (after accounting for the 36% inflation on my gains). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, I'll get to propose again in round 4.  However, inflation will further reduce the value of the money for me, making a better deal less likely.  

It's in my best interest to accept the offer and secure some portion of the money, even if it's less than what I originally wanted."
