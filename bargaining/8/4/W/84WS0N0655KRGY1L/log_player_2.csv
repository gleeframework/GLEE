"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation concerns, so I propose a slightly better split for you."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her due to the inflation dynamic. Rejecting was necessary to push for a better deal.
* **Counter-offer:**
    *  It's still important to offer Alice a deal that appears beneficial to her, given the inflation working against her as well.
    * This offer acknowledges her concern about inflation and proposes a split that's slightly more favorable to her than a 50/50 split would be after one round of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, this is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is becoming increasingly significant. Accepting this offer would mean losing a substantial amount of value compared to the initial rounds.
* **Negotiating Power:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, it's still in her favor. We're running out of rounds, which might pressure her into a better offer next time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Let's end this now and both benefit before inflation eats away more of our potential gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  This is the last round, and accepting a suboptimal deal is better than getting nothing if Alice rejects again.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By offering slightly more than Alice initially proposed (6000 for her in Round 1), we exploit the time pressure. She's incentivized to accept before inflation erodes the value of her potential gain even further. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** This creates a sense of urgency and limits Alice's ability to further negotiate."
