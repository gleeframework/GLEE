"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll be eager to accept and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better deal, Alice! This offer is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and get a slightly better share for myself, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to get closer to the middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up that much more to Bob, especially since the money is worth less and less with each round. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it almost exactly in half, Bob. It's time to wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm trying to get closer to the middle ground, but with a slight bias towards my gain, considering the inflation."
