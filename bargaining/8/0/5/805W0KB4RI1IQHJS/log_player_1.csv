"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small taste of the pie, but I'm keeping most of it for now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no tricks, just a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with less valuable money."
