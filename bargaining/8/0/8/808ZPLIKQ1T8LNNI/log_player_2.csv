"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting $100,000 is a lot of money, accepting such a low offer in the first round leaves a huge amount of potential value on the table. Bob needs to negotiate for a much larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a generous 35% to avoid further delays. This is a strong opening move for a deal we both can benefit from.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Bob needs to assert his position early on. A 65/35 split in his favor demonstrates that he's serious about getting a significant share.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Highlighting the time pressure (money depreciating each round) encourages Alice to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Framing as Generous:**  By presenting the 35% as generous, Bob attempts to make Alice feel like she's getting a good deal, even though it's significantly less than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 60% this time, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're still not satisfied. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but it's not enough! While 60/40 split sounds better, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting now would mean Bob gets even less in real value than Alice's original offer. Bob needs to hold out for a better deal, especially since Alice seems open to further negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  Bob acknowledges Alice's movement towards a compromise to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Positioning the 55/45 split as ""fair"" attempts to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and desire for an equitable outcome.
* **Time Pressure Reminder:**  The clock is ticking, and both sides are losing money.  Reiterating this fact adds urgency and encourages a swift resolution.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slight):** Bob reduces his demand slightly from 65% to 55% signaling flexibility while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
