"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is to split the money evenly, and considering that the money's value will decrease by 10% for me in each subsequent round, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer. I'll get $50, which is half of the total amount, and I won't have to worry about the money's value decreasing in the next rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
