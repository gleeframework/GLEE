"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll give you a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair deal, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we both face. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now, even if it's worth less in real terms, than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
