"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're being too generous with the first offer, let's try to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering Bob's previous offer was 70-30, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to a 50-50 split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's aim for a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering Bob's previous offers were 70-30 and 55-45, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's even closer to a 50-50 split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle, it's a fair deal.""
}
