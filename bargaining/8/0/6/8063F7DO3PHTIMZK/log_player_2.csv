"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work out a better deal later if you want to keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 10$ is something, it's not a good starting point.  There's a lot of rounds left and the money will be worth much less if we keep rejecting. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
