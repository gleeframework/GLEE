"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  Consider the inflation working against you! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about this: I get $5,700 and you get $4,300. It's a slight adjustment from my first offer, acknowledging the inflation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, and her offer still heavily favors her. While the inflation is worse for me, it's also cutting into her potential gains.  I need to push for a more significant shift in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 52/48 split. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a 55/45 split. This factors in the inflation and is a fair deal at this stage. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. While I'd prefer a better split,  Alice is holding firm and the clock is ticking. Accepting her offer at this stage is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
