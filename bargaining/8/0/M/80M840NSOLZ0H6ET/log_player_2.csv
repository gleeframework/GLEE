Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering I've lost 10% of the value in the first round and another 10% in this round, I need a larger share to compensate for the loss. This offer is still generous. 
# Bob gain: 4000
