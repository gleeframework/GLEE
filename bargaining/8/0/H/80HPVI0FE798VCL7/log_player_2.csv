"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. A smaller share now is better than risking a worse deal later for you, Bob.

# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is still a good deal for you. Consider the decreasing value and let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the end. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  This offer is fair, considering the decreasing value of the money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  This is my final offer. Take it, or we both risk walking away with even less. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round. The decreasing value of the money makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice."
