"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob! I'm not sure if I want to give up my potential for a larger share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
