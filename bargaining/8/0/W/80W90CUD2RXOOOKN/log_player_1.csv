Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a fair deal right from the start!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'm getting more money than Bob, I'm not sure I want to settle for only 6000 out of 10,000, especially since there are still 10 rounds left.  I believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'm going to offer a slightly more balanced split this time, hoping to secure a deal before the inflation eats away at the value of the money too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Even though I'm getting less than I was aiming for, the inflation has been eating away at the value of the money and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal in the future.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
