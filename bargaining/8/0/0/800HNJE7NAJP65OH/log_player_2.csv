"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know the money is going to be worth less with each passing round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the money will be worth less in the future.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bigger share now, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's make it happen! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject the offer. Alice's share is increasing, but the money is worth less for me with each round. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We'll both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.""}
