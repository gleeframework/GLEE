"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but still leaves something for Bob, which might make him more likely to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal. It's still worth more for me than doing nothing, but I'm confident I can do better. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant share for myself. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept before inflation eats away too much of his potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and while it's still a decent amount of money, the inflation is really starting to hurt. I need to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further reducing my offer, but I'm still aiming to get a substantial share. I'm hoping Bob will realize that the inflation is only going to get worse for him, and that accepting this offer is better than waiting for a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculously bad. I'm not going to give in to this nonsense. I'm confident I can do better in the next round.  Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I still believe this is a good deal for both of us. It's time for Bob to start getting serious about accepting an offer before inflation eats away all his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is absurdly unfair.  He's taking advantage of inflation, and it's clear he's going to keep pushing for more even though the money he's gaining is worth less and less. I'm not going to cave to his greed. I'm going to hold out for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split. I'm hoping that Bob realizes that at this point, inflation is severely impacting both of us. If he keeps rejecting offers, he'll be left with very little. I'm offering a fair deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of a stalemate."
