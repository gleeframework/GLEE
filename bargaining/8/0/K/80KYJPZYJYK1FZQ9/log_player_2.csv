Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 60/40 split. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to make sure I get a good return after the inflation hit.  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000
