"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 20% share of the money! Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial proposal was 4:1. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I don't think I'll get a better deal in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now, given the inflation rates."
