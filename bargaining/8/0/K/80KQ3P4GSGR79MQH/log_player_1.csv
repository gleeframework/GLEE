"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my thinking to the new inflation rates.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, considering the current market conditions.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.
