"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my potential gains.  Even though this is a fair split, there's a chance I can do better by seeing what Alice will offer next.  I'll take the risk!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  Let's start with a 60/40 split, and see where it goes.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still want a fair share. 60/40 is too skewed, but 60/40 is better than 50/50! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, considering the inflation and the risk of Alice proposing an even worse deal in the next round, I'll accept this offer.  A 60/40 split is better than the initial 50/50 and allows me to secure a decent portion of the money."
