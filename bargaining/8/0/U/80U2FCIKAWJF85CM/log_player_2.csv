"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. I know the money is worth less each round, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I think we should split the money more evenly. 65/35 seems fair to me. Let's see if we can agree on this.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a good middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm worried that continuing to reject offers will lead to a worse outcome due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not drastically worse than my previous proposal."
