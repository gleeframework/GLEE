Let's see if Bob is feeling generous! I'm going to keep a big chunk for myself, but I want to make sure he gets something to keep him happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is pretty insulting. He's taking almost everything and offering me a pittance! I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'll see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm still aiming for a good share, but I'm also trying to be a little more reasonable. Let's see if this gets Bob to the negotiating table."
