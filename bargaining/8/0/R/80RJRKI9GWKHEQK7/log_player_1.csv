"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While I acknowledge the diminishing value of money, this offer still provides a fair and balanced outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
