"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a safe bet for the first round. It's a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and avoid further rounds. However, I'm also aware of the inflation risk and am keeping a large portion of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Even though the money I'm gaining is worth less in this round, I can still do better by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still taking a big chunk, but I'm reducing my share slightly to encourage Bob to accept. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm hoping Bob doesn't realize how much it's impacting his side of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering a lot, the inflation is hurting me significantly.  I need to try and push for a better deal, even if it means risking a few more rounds. I'm still confident I can get a better outcome by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm still pushing for a larger share, but I'm also trying to be more reasonable.  The inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of settling before the money becomes even less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly more in his favor now, I am still confident that I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation is hitting hard, but I still have a chance to get a larger share of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

The inflation is really hurting now. I'm willing to take a 50/50 split to avoid further losses.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value in settling at this point."
