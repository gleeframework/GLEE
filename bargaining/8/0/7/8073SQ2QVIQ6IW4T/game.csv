900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start fair. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and we can adjust later if needed.",Alice,1,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, your starting point wasn't quite fair. Let's be realistic. I propose 65/35.  This reflects the impact of inflation on our potential gains over the remaining rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, I understand inflation is a factor.  But a 65/35 split is too lopsided.  Let's compromise at 70/30. This still gives you a good share, and it's fairer for both of us in the long run.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer, but time is literally money!  Let's settle this with a 55/45 split. It's a strong offer considering the dwindling value and gives us both a fair deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"We're running out of time, Bob.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at 60/40.  This takes into account inflation and ensures we both get something substantial before the value drops further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering 52/48 - it's more than generous considering the time pressure and the fact that I'm hit harder by inflation.  Let's be sensible and end this.",Bob,6,
