I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to get the ball rolling, as I know the money will be worth less to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While Bob's offer is generous, the inflation will quickly eat into the value of my share.  I'm willing to wait another round to see if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
``` 

I'll offer Bob 100,000 this round.  This is a significant increase from the first round, but still leaves me with a majority of the money.  Since the value of my share is decreasing each round, I need to secure a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I've lost a significant amount of potential value due to inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer. The longer I wait, the worse the deal will become for me. This offer is still a substantial sum, and it's better to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing at all."
