Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 52.5/47.5 split is fairer, considering the inflation that will affect you more than me in the next round.  Let's end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
