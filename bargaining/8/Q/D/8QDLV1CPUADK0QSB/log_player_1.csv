"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
