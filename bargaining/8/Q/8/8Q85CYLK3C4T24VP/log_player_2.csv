Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split considering the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my previous proposal. Let's make a deal before the money becomes worthless! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better than before, time is running out, and the value for Bob is decreasing rapidly. It's worth risking another rejection to try and secure a better deal in the next round. Alice knows the clock is ticking, and Bob's negotiating position weakens with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The value is plummeting. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's crunch time.  While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal initially, the rapid inflation means Bob needs to secure a deal fast. Offering this split:

* **Emphasizes fairness:**  It highlights the changing circumstances and positions it as the most logical choice. 
* **Puts pressure on Alice:**  She's been consistently aiming for a larger share, but now risks getting nothing at all if the game continues. 
 
Bob needs to convey urgency and a willingness to walk away if Alice doesn't accept this reasonable offer."
