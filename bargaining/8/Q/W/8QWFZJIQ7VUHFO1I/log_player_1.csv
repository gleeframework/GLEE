Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it in a way that we both get a decent amount. Remember, the money loses value for me over time.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. The inflation is really taking its toll on me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is becoming more willing to compromise. While his offer is slightly better than his last, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. By continuing to reject, I increase the pressure on Bob and might secure a much better deal in the next round."
