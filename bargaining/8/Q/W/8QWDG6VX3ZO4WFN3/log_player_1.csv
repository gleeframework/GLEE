"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money while still leaving Bob with a small amount. It's a risky move, but it maximizes Alice's potential gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the long-term implications. 

* **Inflation:** We know our money is losing value faster than Bob's. Rejecting this offer sets up a potential future where we can secure a more favorable deal. 
* **Power Dynamics:** Bob has shown a willingness to be aggressive.  By rejecting his offer, we demonstrate our own strength and potential to influence the negotiations.

**Strategy:**

It's risky, but by rejecting this offer, we force Bob to negotiate further. This could lead to a more equitable split in the future, especially as inflation continues to impact us more heavily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** We've already seen a significant impact from inflation, so we need to aim for a higher share to compensate. 
* **Power Play:** By rejecting Bob's offer, we showed our willingness to stand firm. This offer is still generous enough to potentially entice Bob, but it demonstrates that we're not afraid to take a bold stance.

**Strategy:**

This offer tries to balance maximizing our gains with minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting it entirely. If Bob accepts, we secure a strong position. If he rejects, we continue the negotiation and can potentially leverage the increasing pressure of inflation in our favor."
