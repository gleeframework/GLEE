"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for haggling!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $4000 is equivalent to $5000 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than last time.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not being too aggressive, considering the inflation is still eating away at the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the decreased value, $3500 is equivalent to $6150 in the first round, and $6500 is equivalent to $8700 in the first round.

While Bob's offer is still a bit more generous than my previous offer, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still want a fair share.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this offer, considering the money is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will take this offer, but I'm still open to negotiations."
