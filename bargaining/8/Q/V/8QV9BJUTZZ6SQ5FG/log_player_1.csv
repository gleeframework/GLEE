"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get $50."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's getting harder to negotiate a better deal due to the increasing inflation. I think 45 is a fair share considering the current value of the money."
