"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair. It's a better deal for you than the previous offer, and it gives me a decent share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
