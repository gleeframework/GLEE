"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this as a sign of good faith. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a very lopsided offer in Alice's favor.  While it's tempting to accept something, the game has just begun and the money is worth more in later rounds. I'll see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. This is a 50/50 split.  I think we can both agree this is a good starting point.""}
