**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While ideally, Bob wanted more, waiting any longer significantly risks getting nothing at all if the rounds run out.  

* **Time pressure:** There are only 5 rounds left. Continuing to decline offers in the hope of getting a slightly better deal becomes riskier with each passing round.
* **Diminishing returns:** The inflation is heavily impacting Bob. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than getting a slightly better offer later when the value has further eroded. 
* **Alice's stance:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. It's unlikely she'll drastically change her position at this stage. 

While $4,400 is significantly less than half, it's still better than nothing, which is the looming alternative."
