"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split. This way we can both get a good amount, and avoid the risk of losing money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth less after the first round, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more money in future rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
