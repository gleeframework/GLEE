"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect me to be too generous.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but don't think you're getting the better deal here. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the numbers are:

* Alice's gain: 6000
* Bob's gain: 4000

I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. I'm not getting the better deal here. I want more! 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now effectively $9,000.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the total amount is now effectively $7,272.70.

Let me think for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal, but it's better than going to the next round and risking even less money.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
