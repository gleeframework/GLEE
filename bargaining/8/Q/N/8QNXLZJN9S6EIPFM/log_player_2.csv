Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Let's analyze why:

* **Inflation:**  We need to consider the inflation impact.  Even though the offer appears worse than the previous round, the inflation makes it actually more favorable for Bob.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  His gain is worth 9.75% less than the initial offer. This means he's getting roughly 4000 * 0.9025 = 3610 in terms of Round 1 value. While it's less than his initial offer, it's still a decent gain considering the potential of getting nothing if we keep rejecting.
* **Alice's Perspective:** Alice's gain is worth 19% less than her initial offer. This means she's getting roughly 6000 * 0.81 = 4860 in terms of Round 1 value. This means she is also losing value from her initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the game risks further inflation and potentially getting zero. Accepting guarantees a gain, even if it's less than what Bob initially hoped for. 

Therefore, it's strategically wise for Bob to accept this offer, as it minimizes the risk of losing everything to inflation."
