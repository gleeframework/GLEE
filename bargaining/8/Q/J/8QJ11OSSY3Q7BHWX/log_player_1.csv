Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair 50/50 split.  We can adjust from there if you'd like, but I believe this is a good foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
