"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my potential gain of $3000 is actually $2400 in real value.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and proceed to the next round. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than $2400. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, hoping to negotiate a better deal next time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, hoping that he'll be willing to accept a smaller amount for himself in order to move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the 50/50 split, but I'll still take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my potential gain of $4000 is actually $2600 in real value.

I'm getting closer to the 50/50 split, but I'd like to push for a bit more. I'll reject this offer and hope to get an even better deal next time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 61.36% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to the 50/50 split, but I still want to be fair. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, hoping that we can finally reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
