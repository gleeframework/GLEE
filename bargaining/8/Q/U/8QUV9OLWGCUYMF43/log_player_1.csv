"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get a nice chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make the game worthwhile for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'll accept this offer.
