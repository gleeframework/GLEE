"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you take 40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split, but I'm taking a slightly larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more equitable split.  It's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 36 (60 * 0.6) in the first round's money.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 55/45 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. The game is worth continuing, but this offer seems fair.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
