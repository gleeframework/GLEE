"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'd rather try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, and 5% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to get a better deal than his previous offer."
