Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and take 60%.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 50-50 split. Let's make a deal!""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and a 50-50 split seems like a good compromise."
