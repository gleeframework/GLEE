"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be a bit more equitable. This offer is still fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob calls his offer ""equitable,"" it's heavily skewed in his favor, especially with the inflation working against me more than him. I need to incentivize him to accept a more reasonable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a good deal for both of us, especially with the clock ticking.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:**  I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split to incentivize Bob to accept. 
* **Emphasizing the time pressure:**  The ""clock ticking"" reminds Bob that further delays hurt him even more than me. 
* **Aiming for a win-win:**  While 60/40 is still in my favor, it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I believe this division is more fair considering the inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **The Time Factor:** Waiting any longer significantly hurts me. With each round, the value of the money diminishes rapidly.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, 400,000 is still a significant amount. Holding out for a better deal in the next round is risky, as Bob's offer might get even worse due to inflation working heavily in his favor.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payoff. Rejecting means gambling on Bob's generosity and risking a much worse outcome in a future round."
