Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 2000

Do you accept this offer?","{
