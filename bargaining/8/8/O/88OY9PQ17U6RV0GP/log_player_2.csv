"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you can take 30. It's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's not a fair split, and I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what Alice proposes!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 60, you can take 40. It's a bit more in my favor, but I'm willing to give you a better deal than the initial 30. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than the 30 I was originally offered, and inflation is a concern. I'd rather have something than risk getting nothing."
