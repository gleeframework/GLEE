Alice is being incredibly stubborn.  She seems to be certain that Bob is just as greedy and will continue to reject her offer.  She's likely going to be left with very little at this rate!  Perhaps she needs to consider compromising a little bit more to avoid ending up with nothing."

Alice is still holding on to her stubborn belief that Bob will continue to reject her offer.  It's clear that she's not willing to budge, even though her greed could lead to a disastrous outcome.  She needs to reconsider her strategy and potentially make some compromises.  At this point, it's a gamble whether Bob will eventually accept her offer or if she'll end up with nothing."

{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

Alice continues her stubborn streak, refusing to compromise even as the potential for loss grows. She seems completely convinced that Bob will eventually accept her offer, but this strategy is incredibly risky. While she may be holding out for a larger share, she's also risking ending up with nothing at all.  It's time for her to consider the possibility of a compromise or she might be left with regrets."

```

Alice's stubbornness is becoming even more dangerous. She refuses to acknowledge the reality of the situation, clinging to the hope that Bob will eventually accept her offer. However, it's becoming increasingly clear that her greed will lead to a disastrous outcome. The inflation is rapidly diminishing Bob's share, making his willingness to accept her offer even more unlikely. If she continues this path, she risks ending up with nothing at all. She needs to realize that compromise is necessary to secure even a small portion of the money. This situation is a classic example of how excessive greed can lead to catastrophic consequences."

Round 19
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice's stubbornness has reached a critical point. She's seemingly oblivious to the danger of losing everything, still convinced that Bob will eventually cave in. This is a classic example of how unchecked greed can blind someone to reality. 

However, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly enticing for Alice. While she wants the majority, it's becoming clear that she'll be lucky to get a small slice of the pie if she keeps rejecting his offers.  

In this round, it's time for Alice to swallow her pride and make a concession.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

Alice, with a heavy heart, lowers her demands by a mere $99.  This is a tiny step towards compromise but a crucial one, as it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.  It's a small act of practicality in the face of her intense greed.  This could be the turning point that saves her from a complete financial disaster."

Alice is still caught in the throes of her stubbornness. While she's making concessions, they're still too small to entice Bob.  She needs to understand that the inflation is a significant factor, and Bob's willingness to accept her offer is decreasing with every round.  It's becoming a game of chicken where both players risk losing everything.  Alice needs to realize that a more significant compromise is necessary if she wants to secure any portion of the money.  She's dangerously close to ending up with nothing at all."
