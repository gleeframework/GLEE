"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the 100$ and Bob gets 30%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $50, which is worth 80% of the original $70 I was offered in the first round (since it's 20% less). That's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'll take 60, thanks!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation hits!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting now!

Considering the new values, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $30, which is worth 42.86% of the original $70 I was offered in the first round (since it's 48.8% less). That's a significant drop.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and Bob's offer is still a significant portion of the remaining money. I'll decide to accept this offer to get some cash and limit my losses.
