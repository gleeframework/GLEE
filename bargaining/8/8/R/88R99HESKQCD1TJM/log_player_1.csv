"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. It's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round and losing more value due to inflation. Let's finalize the split!"
