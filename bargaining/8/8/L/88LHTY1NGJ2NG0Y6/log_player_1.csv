"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who should get more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, even if it's slightly better than the initial offer. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a more equal split. It's Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 58/42 is the best I can do""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a fair share. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being quite persistent in trying to get the larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 35/65 split. I think I can do better than that. The money is worth less and less with each passing round, so I'd like to try to get a better deal before it's too late. It's Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 38/62 is the minimum I'll accept""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split. I think I can do better than that. The money is getting scarcer with each passing round, but I'd like to try to hold out for a better deal. It's Bob's turn again!"
