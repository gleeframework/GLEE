"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 60/40 split seems fair at first glance, it's crucial to remember that the money will devalue in each round.  Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to propose a split more favorable to myself in the next round,  knowing that the money will be worth less for Alice then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 35 dollars, but I think I deserve a bit more this time. We both know the money is devaluing, so let's try to find a split we can both agree on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 35.  Let's split it 45/55.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is now more favorable to me than my own proposal in the previous round, considering the inflation. I'd rather accept and secure a decent share than risk further devaluation."
