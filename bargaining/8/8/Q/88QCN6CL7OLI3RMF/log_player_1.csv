"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm going to take a bigger cut this round! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad move by Bob! But I'm not going to let him take all the cake.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger cut, but I'm still willing to compromise. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still not budging. Time to make a bigger move! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being tough! The money is worth a lot less than it used to be, and I'm not getting any younger.

I'll think carefully about this offer... But I'm not ready to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, but I'm not giving up. I'll try to make a stronger offer, but I'll have to be careful not to give away too much.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing hard, but I'm not going to let you take it all. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's last offer, but still gives him a decent share."
