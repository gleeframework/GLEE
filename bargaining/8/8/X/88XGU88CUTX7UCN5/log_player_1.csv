"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10. This gives me a significant advantage while still providing Bob with something.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 5% inflation, getting $10 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round.  It's likely that Bob will continue to propose increasingly unfavorable splits as the game progresses."
