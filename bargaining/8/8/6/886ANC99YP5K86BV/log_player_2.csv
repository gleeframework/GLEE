"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, taking 90% and leaving 10% for you. It's a good deal for both of us!

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Consider that the value decreases for you with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll counter your offer with a 40/60 split. It's still in your favor, but a bit closer to what I believe is a fair compromise. Let's find a middle ground before the value continues to drop for me. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is getting better, and it's in my best interest to take a reasonable deal while the value for her is significantly decreasing. Accepting now guarantees a decent gain.
