"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a significant one, to see if he's willing to accept and end the game early."
