"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a relatively even split, with me getting the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both need to agree on this.  Let's see if you're willing to be more reasonable this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round. That's a significant drop!

Given Bob's proposal, I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. With that in mind, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
