Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach in the first round. I'll offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly. This is because the inflation effect is unknown to me, but I'm assuming it will be in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree. Accepting this ensures I get at least half the money."
