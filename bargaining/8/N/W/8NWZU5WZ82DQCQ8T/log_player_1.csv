I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get this over quickly. I'm taking a big chunk, but I'm giving Bob something to make it worth his while to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split considering the inflation. It's better to get something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
