Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  Let's be practical.  This is my final offer.  Accept it, or we risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the clock is ticking, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm betting she's getting nervous and will offer a larger amount soon to avoid getting $0."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the wire. I'm dropping my offer a bit, but this is still a good deal for both of us. Let's not risk everything. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure now, dropping her offer suggests she's willing to negotiate further. Holding out for a better offer still makes sense. We're getting close, but I'm betting she'll crack before I do."
