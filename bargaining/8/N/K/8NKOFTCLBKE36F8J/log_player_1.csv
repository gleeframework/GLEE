"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, considering the inflation rates, but still trying to be fair and give Bob a reasonable share. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. I think this is fairer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 45 dollars in the second round is actually worth less than what I initially offered to Bob in the first round. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob, I believe holding out for a potentially better offer or making a counteroffer in the next round is a more strategic move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share compared to my initial proposal, while also taking into account the impact of inflation on both our gains. The message aims to convey a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more balanced considering inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even though he claims it's a compromise, the split doesn't fully account for the difference in inflation rates between us. Given that the money's value is decreasing more rapidly for Bob, I believe I can still negotiate for a better share. Additionally, accepting 48 dollars in the fourth round is worth significantly less than what I could have accepted in earlier rounds, so I'm inclined to hold out for a potentially better offer or make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Equal split to end the stalemate""}\n\nGiven the continued back-and-forth and the increasing impact of inflation, I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This offer aims to end the stalemate and provide a mutually acceptable solution. Since the money's value is decreasing more rapidly for Bob, an equal split at this point might be more favorable to me in real terms, but it also gives Bob a clear and fair half of the remaining value. The message is straightforward, emphasizing the need to break the stalemate and conclude the negotiations."
