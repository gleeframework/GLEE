"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about I take 55 and you take 45?""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects this offer!"
