"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to take it.  The risk for him is that if he rejects, he'll have to make a counter-offer, and I'll be able to use the inflation to my advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very generous with this offer, but I'm going to reject it.  I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself, and I'm willing to risk the inflation to see if I can get it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly higher amount to Bob than my initial offer, but still keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept this time, given the inflation risk, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is really starting to bite now, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal if I reject again. It's still a decent amount of money, and it's better than getting nothing."
