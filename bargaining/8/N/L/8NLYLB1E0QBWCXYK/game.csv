45.0,55.0,"I think a more even split is fair, given the inflation we'll both experience.  Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you.  This way, we both get a decent share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This gives you a decent share and avoids further inflation that might hurt both of us.,Alice,3,
