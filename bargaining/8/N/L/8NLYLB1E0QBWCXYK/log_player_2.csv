{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, given the inflation we'll both experience.  Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you.  This way, we both get a decent share.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This gives you a decent share and avoids further inflation that might hurt both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
