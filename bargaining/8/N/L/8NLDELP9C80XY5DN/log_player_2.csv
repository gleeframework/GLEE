"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation might affect our future offers.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though Alice's offer is fair in the current round, it's likely that she'll make a more favorable offer for herself in the future rounds, as the inflation will affect me more than it affects her. I want to see how she'll negotiate as the inflation kicks in."
