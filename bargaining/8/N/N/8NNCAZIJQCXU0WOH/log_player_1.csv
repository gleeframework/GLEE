"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an opening offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned! Bob is now making the generous offer.

I'll carefully consider the offer and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the decreased value of the money."
