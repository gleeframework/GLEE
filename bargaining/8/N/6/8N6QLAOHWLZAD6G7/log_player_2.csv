"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point. We can negotiate further, but I think this is a good foundation. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a very unfair offer. While I understand the game is designed for Alice to have the upper hand, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll wait for my chance to make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 495000, ""alice_gain"": 505000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more equitable split. I propose we each take half. It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust as we move forward.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a more equitable split, but I'm still willing to offer a generous amount.  We both need to be strategic with this decreasing value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still significantly unfair, even with her ""generous"" words.  I'm not willing to accept such a low amount, especially with the money losing value each round. I'll continue to push for a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. I'm proposing a 48/52 split in your favor.  This acknowledges the value difference, while still being closer to an equitable split. Let's find common ground.""}
