"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn. I understand the inflation puts us both in a tough spot, so I'm aiming for something closer to the middle. This offer is good for this round only.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** It's crucial to recognize that Alice's money devalues four times faster than mine. This means she's under more pressure to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Round 1 Rejection:** By rejecting Alice's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate and believe I have some bargaining power.
* **Round 2 Offer:**  While I'm aiming for a larger share than Alice offered, I'm still proposing a significant amount to her (4500$). This might be tempting enough for her to accept, considering the rapid devaluation of her potential gains in future rounds.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the time sensitivity (""this round only"") and aims to portray the offer as reasonable under the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the loss of value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamic:**  While Alice's message attempts to sound generous, the reality is that the inflation is hitting her much harder. Her offer acknowledges this shift in bargaining power.
* **Still Unfavorable:** Even with her ""concession,"" the offer is still tilted in Alice's favor, especially when considering the significant devaluation she's facing each round. 
* **Holding My Ground:** I'm betting that Alice's desperation to avoid further losses will lead her to propose a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and frankly, your share is eroding faster than mine. This is my final offer; take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Stance:**  At this stage, a more assertive approach is necessary. Alice needs to understand that time is not on her side.
* **Finality:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She now faces a stark choice: accept a decreasing share or risk getting even less in a future round. 
* **Justification:** While the offer heavily favors me, I'm framing it as a consequence of the situation (her rapidly devaluing share) rather than pure greed. This might make it easier for her to swallow.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** This is a high-risk, high-reward play. There's a chance Alice might call my bluff, leading to a worse outcome for both of us in the next round.
* **Alice's Personality:** This strategy assumes Alice is rational and primarily motivated by maximizing her gains (even if they are diminishing). If Alice is prone to spite or emotional decision-making, this approach could backfire."
