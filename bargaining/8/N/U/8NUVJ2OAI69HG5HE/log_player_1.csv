"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, my gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, which is $270,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $665,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
