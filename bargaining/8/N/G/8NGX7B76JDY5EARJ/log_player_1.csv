I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, leaving just a small amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, as it's better than nothing, but I'm also aware that he might reject it and try to get more in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more generous than my initial offer, but I'm still going to reject it. I'm hoping to get even more in the next round, as I know the inflation will work in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to try and push for a higher share again.  I'm still betting on the inflation to make me a more attractive partner for Bob in future rounds."

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it is better than nothing, I'm hoping that with the continued inflation, Bob will be forced to offer me an even higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

I'm going to try and get closer to my initial goal.  I'm hoping that Bob is feeling the pressure of the inflation and will be more willing to accept a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While it is a significant amount of money, I'm hoping to get a larger share with the continued pressure of inflation."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000} 
```

I'm pushing for a very high share again.  I believe the inflation is starting to have a serious effect on Bob's options, and he might be willing to accept this offer just to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds and the inflation is clearly taking its toll on Bob's options. It's a good amount of money, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
