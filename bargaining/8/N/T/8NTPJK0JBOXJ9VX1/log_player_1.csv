"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned! Bob is now trying to take the larger share. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the previous round, and 10% less than the original amount), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let me calculate the effective value of the money for Bob in this round... 

Since the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider the value of his share in the first round (100,000) and the effect of the 27.1% decrease.

The effective value of Bob's share in this round is approximately 72.9% of 100,000, which is 72,900.

Now, let's compare my share in this round (200,000) to the effective value of Bob's share (72,900). I'd be getting a larger share, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's a good deal.

After thinking about it, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more attractive to Bob, considering the reduced value of the money."
