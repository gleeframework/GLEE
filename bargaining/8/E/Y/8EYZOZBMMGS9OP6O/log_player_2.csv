"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust things in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible deal for Bob!  While Alice is suggesting ""adjusting in later rounds"", the heavily inflated discount for Alice means she's heavily incentivized to drag this out. It's better to push for a more equitable split early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""That's too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a more reasonable split? This offer still gives you a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 65, you take 35.  We're both losing value with each round, so let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a much better deal for Bob than Alice's initial offer. While not ideal, continued rounds heavily favor Alice due to the faster rate of devaluation. It's better to accept a reasonable offer now than risk getting even less later."
