Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor, but still reasonable. I'll also mention the decreasing value of money to put some pressure on Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be greedy, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Although the value of money has decreased, Alice's offer of 35 is still a relatively good deal, considering the decreasing value of money. I also don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value. Alice's message also implies that she's not willing to negotiate further, so I'll take what I can get."
