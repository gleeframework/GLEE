"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split, taking into account the inflation that will reduce the value of the money in subsequent rounds.

Please relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation rate.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,

I've reduced my initial offer to 57% of the money, leaving 43% for Bob. I've included a message suggesting that we meet in the middle, taking into account the inflation that's affecting both of us.
