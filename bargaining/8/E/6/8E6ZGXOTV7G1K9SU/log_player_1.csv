I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident we can find a more agreeable split in the next round if this isn't accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
``` 

I'm proposing a more balanced 450,000 to 550,000 split.  Since inflation is a factor, I'm willing to compromise, but I'm hoping we can find a better split than the last round."
