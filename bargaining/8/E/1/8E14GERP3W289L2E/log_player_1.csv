"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This is a 80-20 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think I can do better than 70-30. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 20% reduction in value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll aim for a more aggressive split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! With my potential gain worth 48.8% less than the original $10,000, I need to be careful. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than his previous one, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
