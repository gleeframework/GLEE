"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I think this is a good starting point for us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but due to inflation, waiting isn't beneficial for either of us. This offer ensures a good amount for us both.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth for both players, but especially for Alice. It's in Bob's best interest to settle quickly.
* **Stronger Position:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals he's willing to negotiate for a better deal. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** Offering Alice $4000 (what she initially offered Bob) might seem like a power play. Offering $6000 for himself and $4000 for Alice is a more balanced counter-offer and still heavily favors Bob due to the rapid inflation."
