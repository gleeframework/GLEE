  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you're getting away with too much, but I'm not that generous""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think he's being too aggressive with the 70-30 split. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with 80% this time, I'm not that desperate""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's even more lopsided than before. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm starting to worry that Bob is going to take advantage of the inflation to get the better end of the deal."
