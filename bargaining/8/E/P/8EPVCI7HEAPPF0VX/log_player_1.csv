"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the inflation effect this time. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4750. Bob's gain of $5000 is worth $5000, but since it's 10% less for him, it's actually worth $4500.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a better deal than me, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject this offer.

In terms of the current value of the money, Bob's gain is $6,921.51 x 0.6 = $4,142.91, and Alice's gain is $6,921.51 x 0.4 = $2,778.60.
