Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, giving myself a large share. This is a risky strategy, as Bob might reject it and then get to propose a split in his favor. However, I hope he'll recognize that the longer we play, the less the money will be worth, and he'll take what he can get."
