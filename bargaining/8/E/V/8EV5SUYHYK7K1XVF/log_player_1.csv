Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I don't want to accept the offer because I can do better than a 50-50 split. I can make a new offer that gives me more money.

Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not convinced that this offer is the best I can get, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll try to do better.
