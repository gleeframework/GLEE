"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, I'll take the risk of more rounds!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting the majority of the money to start. My message to Bob is to see if he'll accept the initial split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55, you can have 45. It's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as keen on accepting a 45-55 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in round 2, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50-50 split, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
