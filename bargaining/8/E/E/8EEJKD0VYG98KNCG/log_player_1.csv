"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting 60% of the remaining money, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly smaller share than the 50/50 split I proposed initially, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4500, but I think this is the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his original offer from Round 2, but with a slightly lower amount for himself.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, and I'm not sure I want to give up 55% of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to ensure I get a decent amount""
}
```

I'm trying to take a firmer stance and offer Bob a smaller share, while still keeping a significant portion of the remaining money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to come back to the original 50/50 split proposal from Round 1, but with a lower amount due to inflation.

Considering the significant drop in value due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'd rather accept this offer and get a guaranteed 50% of the remaining amount, rather than continuing to negotiate and risk getting a worse deal.
