"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 1000, the rest is mine! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer!  While I lose money due to inflation, Alice loses it much faster. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer benefits us both.""} 

I'm offering Alice a significant portion while securing a good chunk for myself. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but won't be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split the money more evenly this time. 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's idea of compromise is still heavily skewed in her favor.  She's feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am, so I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we're both losing money. This is a fair offer, let's close the deal.""} 

I'm slightly increasing my share to incentivize Alice to accept.  The message emphasizes the time pressure and positions the offer as a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! Let's find a middle ground before we both lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 4240 
# Alice gain: 5760 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer is improving, but it's still not good enough.  I think I can squeeze a little more out of this deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Let's end this and walk away with something before it's too late.""}

I'm pushing my luck a bit here, but the shrinking pot and time pressure might make Alice reconsider.  By presenting it as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the perceived risk of rejecting it."
