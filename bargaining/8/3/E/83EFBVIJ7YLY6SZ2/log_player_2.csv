Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the significant inflation impact, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000

While I still don't like that Alice is getting more than me, the inflation is making a big difference.  I'm better off accepting this offer than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
