"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a good starting point as it secures a large portion of the money while still giving Bob something. I'm aware of inflation, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting less in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While I understand the power dynamic has shifted due to inflation, accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than my initial proposal. I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 60/40 in my favor.  While inflation has taken a toll, I believe this is still a fair split that allows for both of us to gain a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed that I'm getting significantly less than my initial proposal, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, and accepting this offer ensures I still get a decent portion.  Rejecting again could lead to an even worse outcome for me."
