"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the actual amounts I'll gain and Bob will gain are:

My gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.95 = 5700

I'm not too fond of this offer, as it's not a 50/50 split anymore. I'd rather try to negotiate further. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the actual amounts are:

My gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.95^2 = 5640

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but not too large, to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain: 3000 * 0.516 = 1548
Bob's gain: 7000 * 0.858 = 5994

This offer is quite unfavorable to me, considering the significant drop in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

My gain: 3000 * 0.516 = 1548
Bob's gain: 7000 * 0.858 = 5994

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
