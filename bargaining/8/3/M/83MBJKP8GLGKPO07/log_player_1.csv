Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of losing everything in later rounds.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to have more, it's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all with further rounds and inflation."
