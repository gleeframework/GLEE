"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share to avoid the risk of inflation.  If he doesn't, I'll need to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer. While he gets more money, his gain is worth 20% less due to inflation.  I'm not going to accept such a drastic shift in the distribution.  I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly, but still offer a fair deal. I'm hoping Bob will realize that continued rejection will likely lead to a worse outcome for him due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, but the inflation has significantly reduced the value of his gains.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk another round where Bob's gain will be worth even less."
