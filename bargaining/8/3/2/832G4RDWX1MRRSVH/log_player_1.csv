"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 55-45, but I think we can both do better. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split. I was hoping for a more even split, and 45 is a bit too low for my taste. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's try 58-42!""}

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's getting late, and the value of the money is decreasing. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's right, the value of the money is decreasing, and it's getting late in the game. An even split of 50-50 seems like a fair and reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division of the $100."
