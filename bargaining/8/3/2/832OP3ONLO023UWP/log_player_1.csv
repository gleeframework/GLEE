Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a 55/45 split. It's a good deal considering the time pressure and inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the pressure of time and inflation, but I still believe a 55/45 split in my favor is the fairest option. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking very close to his original unfair offer.  It's important to show him I'm serious about getting a better deal, especially with the increasing effects of inflation.  He needs to feel the pressure too."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the pot is shrinking.  My final offer is 52/48.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting. Making a ""final offer"" emphasizes this.
* **Concession:** Offering 52/48 shows a slight concession from 55/45, but holds a firm line against Bob's attempts for a larger share. 
* **Direct Language:** ""Take it or leave it"" leaves no room for misinterpretation. It forces Bob to make a decision."
