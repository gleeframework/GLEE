"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  It's better to get something than risk the money shrinking with inflation!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more, inflation is a real threat.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure I get something before the money shrinks further."
