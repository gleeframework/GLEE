"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20 and keep 80. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way to do it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting the money, I'll need to adjust my decision.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll think about the 50$ I would gain from this offer in terms of the original value, which would be 55$ (50$ / 0.9). That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and propose my next one.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I'm not sure 55$ is the best I can get. I'll make a counteroffer.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40 and take 60. It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time for a more equitable split, considering inflation. I'll take 60, and you can have 40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation rate is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think about the 40$ I would gain from this offer in terms of the original value, which would be around 43.64$ (40$ / 0.9189, since 100 * 0.271 = 27.1% decrease). It's not a bad offer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll reject the offer and propose my next one.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, but I need to keep 70 to make up for the inflation. It's a fair compromise, considering the current value of the money.""

I'm proposing a 70:30 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal. I'll take 70, and you can have 30. This offer takes inflation into account and ensures a more equitable distribution. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think about the 30$ I would gain from this offer in terms of the original value, which would be around 19.51$ (30$ / 1.532, since 100 * 0.4095 = 40.95% decrease). It's a relatively small amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll reject the offer and propose my next one.

I'm proposing a 85:15 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This round, I'm taking 80.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm going to need to take a bigger share to make up for it. It's the only way to keep things balanced. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is really decimating the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think about the 20$ I would gain from this offer in terms of the original value, which would be around 9.64$ (20$ / 2.073, since 100 * 0.5217 = 52.17% decrease). It's a very small amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll reject the offer and propose my next one.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'll take 90, and you can have 10. Inflation has taken a significant toll on both of us, but I need to prioritize my own needs. This is the only way to ensure I get what I deserve after all these rounds. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is really devastating the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think about the 10$ I would gain from this offer in terms of the original value, which would be around 3.88$ (10$ / 2.585, since 100 * 0.6126 = 61.26% decrease). It's a very small amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

However, I've been rejecting offers for a while, and I'm starting to think that this might be the best I can get. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept your final offer. 3.88$ isn't much, but it's better than nothing.""
