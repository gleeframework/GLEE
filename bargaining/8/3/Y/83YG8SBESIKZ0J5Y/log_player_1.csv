Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing for you, Alice. This is a good time for us to settle. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean settling for less than what I offered Bob in Round 1.  I'm aiming for a fair deal, and I believe I still have some room to negotiate before considering an offer this low."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Inflation Pressure:** Inflation is eating into my potential gains with each passing round.  
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems determined to secure a larger share, but continuing to lowball me could backfire on him.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and appealing to Bob's sense of reason might be the best strategy at this point."
