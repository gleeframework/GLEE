"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, giving Alice a significant share while still offering Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 850,000, but increasing Bob's to 150,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, and hopefully, will lead to an agreement before we lose more money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a better offer for me than what I proposed in round 3, and it's closer to a 50/50 split. Since we're losing money with each round, it's best to accept this offer and secure at least some profit."
