"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split it fairly, but I need more than you to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While it seems tempting to get something now, it's far better to negotiate in the early rounds. The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice will become as her share loses value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer is much fairer and leaves you with a significant sum.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than this to make it worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is feeling the pressure, but this offer is still tilted in her favor. It's worth pushing our luck a bit further, especially since our buying power hasn't diminished."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm offering a fair deal. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hopeful we can find a way to split this more evenly. This is my final offer before inflation makes it too late. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, but sticking to our guns is likely the best play.  Here's why:

* **Alice is bluffing:**  Her ""final offer"" language is a tactic to pressure us. She knows the longer the game goes on, the worse it is for her.
* **Time is on our side (sort of):** While neither of us benefits from stalled negotiations, Alice's share is shrinking faster. She's more motivated to make a deal.

We need to project confidence and push her to give up more ground in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a generous offer considering the time pressure. Don't let inflation force your hand further. Let's end this now.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Slight Compromise:** We're moving closer to the middle ground, but still maintaining an advantage. This shows a willingness to negotiate without caving.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pot, hoping to make Alice more agreeable. 
* **""Generous Offer"":**  Framing is key. By presenting this offer as favorable to Alice, we might sway her perception."
