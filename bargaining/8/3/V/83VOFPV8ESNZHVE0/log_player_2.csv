"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

It's better to reject and see what Alice offers next round. Since I lose 5% value per round, waiting and negotiating for a better deal is likely in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the value decreases for me each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer secures me a gain, albeit less than what I initially hoped for.  Waiting longer risks further losses due to inflation."
