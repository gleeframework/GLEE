"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1. This might seem a bit lopsided, but it's a fair start given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced starting point. It's fair to both of us, and allows for some room for negotiation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
