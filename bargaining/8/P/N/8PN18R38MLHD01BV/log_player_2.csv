Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be smart 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting anything less than 500,000 at this point sets a bad precedent and makes me appear desperate.  There's still time to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly and end the game. This is fair and avoids further losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, think about it 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is crippling at this point. While 460,000 is less than I hoped for, rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. If Alice continues to lowball me in the remaining rounds, I might end up with even less or nothing at all. It's time to cut my losses and secure something rather than risk everything."
