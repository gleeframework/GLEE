"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can end the game here if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to consider that. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, and my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll aim to get a larger share, considering the inflation will only make things worse for Bob's gain in future rounds.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! Bob's gain is worth significantly less than before, and I'll need to take that into account.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer. It's a relatively close split, and I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds. I'll accept this offer.
