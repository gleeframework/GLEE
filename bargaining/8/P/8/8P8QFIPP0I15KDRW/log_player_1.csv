"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of 450,000 is now worth 427,500.

I'm not too impressed with Bob's offer, considering the money is worth less for me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 600,000 is now worth 540,000.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, hoping to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money.

```

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of 550,000 is now worth 472,700.

I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'll think about it for a moment...
