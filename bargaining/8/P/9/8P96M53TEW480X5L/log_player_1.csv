I propose that Alice receives $990,000 and Bob receives $10,000. I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can get the game over quickly."

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. With only two rounds left, the value of the money has depreciated significantly, and neither of us will get much more by continuing to play. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, given the circumstances."
