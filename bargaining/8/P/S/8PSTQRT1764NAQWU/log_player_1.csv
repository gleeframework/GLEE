"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,000 I proposed in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 90% of the original $6,666.67 he proposed in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm giving up $4,000, which is 50% of the original amount I proposed, and Bob is gaining 90% of what he originally proposed. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to do better in the next round.
