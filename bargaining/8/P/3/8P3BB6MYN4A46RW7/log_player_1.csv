Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but that offer was too low. Let's be fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out! This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** By round 3, the value of the money has decreased significantly. It's crucial to convey a sense of urgency to Bob.
* **Slight Concession:** I've slightly increased Bob's share from my original offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing my own gain. 
* **Finality:**  ""Take it or leave it"" signals that I'm unwilling to negotiate further, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

The goal is to strike a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before inflation further erodes the value."
