"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get most of the money, but still give Bob a decent amount to make him consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is still extremely lopsided, even though the inflation has hit Bob harder. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my demand a bit, but I'm still going for a large share.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing value with each round and agree to a deal before things get too bad."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is still trying to get a huge advantage, despite the fact that the inflation is hurting him much more than me. I'm going to try to get a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  With the inflation hitting both of us hard, it's time for a compromise. This offer is fair and gives us both a decent share of the money."
