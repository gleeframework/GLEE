"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, which is a fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is worth 80% of the original 50, which is 40 dollars, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 90% of the original 50, which is 45 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
