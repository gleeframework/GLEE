"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original 100$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one.

I'll decide to...

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still affecting the money, I'll aim to get an even larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the decreasing value, I'll have to be cautious about accepting an offer that's not significantly higher than the previous ones. However, 75 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for another offer that might not come.

I'll decide to...
