"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's make it a bit more even. This offer still gives us both a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a more even split, but the inflation is working against you, Bob.  This is a strong offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's find a compromise. This is closer to your offer, but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on my side. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more even split, he's still getting a significant portion of the money considering the rapid depreciation affecting his gains. Holding out a bit longer could push him towards a deal where I get closer to 60% of the initial amount."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it's a good deal considering the inflation hitting your side.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds left, the pressure is on Bob to make a decision.  
* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my demand slightly from 6500 to 6200 to show some flexibility and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Inflation:**  It's crucial to keep reminding Bob that the longer he waits, the less his potential share will be worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing it all. This is my compromise - it's more than your last offer, and time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're now past the halfway point. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real. 
* **Acceptable Offer:** While not ideal, 5500 is still more than Bob's previous offer and closer to my target of around 60%. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. 
* **Bob's Desperation:**  Bob's message and offer suggest increasing desperation. He might be willing to concede even further in a future round, but there's no guarantee, and the risk is too high now."
