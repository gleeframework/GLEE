"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob receives 20%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bit more, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the offer, as I'd like to get a bit more than 60% of the remaining $10,000. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing that I receive 70% of the remaining $10,000 and Bob receives 30%. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. At this point, I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't agree on a split."
