"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair start. Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is very unfair to Bob. While it's good to be cautious about inflation, starting with such a lopsided split doesn't seem promising.  Bob should try to negotiate a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split.  We both need to consider the inflation, but I think we can find a win-win solution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair share after inflation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it still doesn't account for the inflation impacting Bob's share significantly more. Bob should continue to push for a more balanced split, even if it means taking a slight hit due to the rapidly increasing inflation on his side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm trying to be fair, considering the inflation impact on both of us. This offer gives you a larger share, but still allows me a decent return.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
