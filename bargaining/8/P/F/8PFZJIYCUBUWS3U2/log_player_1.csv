"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 70-30 ratio, with me receiving 700,000 dollars. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. While I understand your concerns about inflation, this offer gives you a significant share and reduces the risk of further devaluation.  Let's reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
