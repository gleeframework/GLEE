"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the $1,000,000 equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% this time, but I'm not getting any lower than that 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since I value my gain at 500,000 in the first round, and it's worth the same now, I'm looking for a gain of at least 500,000 in value. Bob's offer is 400,000, which is worth less than my target. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40% for him, I'll try to meet him halfway. I'll offer 45% to him, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still not as much as I initially wanted.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, 45% is a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not budging more than 70% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, Bob's gain is worth 72.9% of its original value, which is less than my target of 500,000. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll offer 55% to him, which is a bit more than my previous offer, and see if he'll accept.

```
