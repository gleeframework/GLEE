"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but also leaves a decent amount for Bob. I think it's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. My money is losing value much faster than Bob's, so I need to try and maximize my gains in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller amount for myself this round, but I'm still keeping the majority.  This is because Bob rejected my previous offer, which means he's likely looking for a more even split. However, I need to act fast to secure a good amount before my money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm still holding out. I know my money is losing value quickly, but if I accept this offer, I'll be losing out on a significant portion of the potential gains. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, but still keeping a comfortable majority. Bob's offer was too low, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I need to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a situation where both of us get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still not willing to accept it. My money is losing value incredibly fast, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  The next few rounds are critical, so I'll need to be strategic with my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure a decent amount before it's too late. This offer is a significant compromise, but it gives me a good chunk of the remaining value. I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency and accept this offer, but if he rejects, we are both going to end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call. My money is worth so little now that I'm losing a lot with each passing round.  While I'd prefer a more even split, I risk getting nothing if I continue to reject offers. Accepting this offer at least guarantees me some money, even if it's much less than I initially hoped for."
