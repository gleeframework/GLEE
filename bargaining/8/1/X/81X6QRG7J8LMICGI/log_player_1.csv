"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round.  I'm offering you a fair split, and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $360,000.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I would be getting less than I proposed in the first round. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $360,000 in the previous round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $324,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob. This is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split in my favor, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering you a little less than my last proposal, but I'm confident we can reach a deal this round. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in each subsequent round, and there have been 3 rounds so far, the money is worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729, or 72.9% of its original value.

My gain of $420,000 in the previous round is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $306,180.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I would be getting less than my previous proposal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for the next round.

  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to my price, Bob. But I'm not quite there yet.""
