"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's not a bad deal, considering the inflation.

I'll decide to...
