"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

My gain would be $3000 * 0.8 = $2400, which is less than my initial gain of $5000.

I'll reject this offer for now.
