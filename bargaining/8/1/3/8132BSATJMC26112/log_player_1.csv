I'm offering Bob $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in accepting it.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is starting to take effect. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, while rejecting it could lead to a worse outcome in future rounds.  It's a calculated risk, but I'm willing to take it."
