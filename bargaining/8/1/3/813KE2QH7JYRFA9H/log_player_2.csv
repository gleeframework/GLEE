"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate is higher for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer, Bob.  While it seems fair at first glance, I know that Alice's inflation rate is much higher than mine. I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly, but I think we both deserve more than we got in the last offer. This takes into account the inflation we're both experiencing, but I'm open to negotiating.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. The inflation hits me harder, and your previous offer wasn't fair considering that. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Alice's offer is closer to a fair split, considering the inflation rates.  It's better than risking the money getting even smaller with each passing round."
