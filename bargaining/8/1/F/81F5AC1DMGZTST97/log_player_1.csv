"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant share of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to split the money evenly. I'm not sure if that's the best option, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
