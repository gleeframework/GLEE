"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low share, especially with inflation eating into my gains.""
}
```

I'll try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not happy about the significant decrease in my share due to inflation. However, I'll try to think strategically and consider the fact that Bob is willing to give me a slightly better deal than in the previous round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low share, but I'll think about making a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'll try to come up with a new proposal that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better deal, but I need a significant improvement.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better share, but I'm also aware that the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round."
