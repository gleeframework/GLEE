Let's split it evenly to start!  I'm hoping for a quick and fair resolution. ðŸ˜Š"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to propose a slightly better split for me, but still fair.  I hope Bob will see that we can both come out ahead with this deal."
