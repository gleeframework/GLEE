This is a fair offer in my eyes as I get the lion's share but Bob still gets something to work with. Since I get 90% of the initial money and Bob only gets 10%, the fact that the money is worth less for him in future rounds, even if we get to the last one, will still leave him with a significant profit!  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
