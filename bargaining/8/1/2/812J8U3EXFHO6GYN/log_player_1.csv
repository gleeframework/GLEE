"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as keen on the idea of giving Bob a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my original idea of a 60-40 split, but I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet! This is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split, but still in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway this time. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth less and less. I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair compromise and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll take $450,000 and we can end the game."
