Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure of the inflation. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's better to take what I can get at this point. The inflation is killing my gains, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer next round."
