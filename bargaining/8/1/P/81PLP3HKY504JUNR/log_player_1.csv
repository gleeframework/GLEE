"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we don't know much about each other's preferences yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but I'm open to negotiations 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm thinking strategically.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, but I want 70""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm proposing that Bob gets 30% of the remaining $100, which is $30, and I get the remaining 70%, which is $70. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Last chance to settle""}

I'm proposing that I get 40% of the remaining $100, which is $40, and Bob gets the remaining 60%, which is $60. I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk of the money. This is my final offer, so let's see if Bob is willing to accept it."
