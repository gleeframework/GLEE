I propose a 90/10 split. I'm confident Bob will see the value in getting a sizable portion of the money, even though it's less than half."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob to 20% of the total. Since Bob rejected my initial offer and offered me a much lower amount, I believe it's fair to increase the amount I am willing to give him to avoid the potential of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to increase my offer to Bob, hoping to reach a compromise before the inflation becomes too severe. 700,000 for me is still a significant amount, and I believe this offer is fair given the previous rounds' negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than the previous rounds, the inflation rate has significantly reduced the value of the money. It's still better than nothing, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a larger share of the money before the inflation completely erodes its value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We are running out of time, and the inflation is getting worse. I'm willing to concede more to Bob to avoid the risk of both of us getting nothing. A 60/40 split feels like a fair compromise at this stage, given the history of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting very high, and the risk of ending up with nothing is becoming more and more real. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me some money, which is better than risking getting nothing at all."
