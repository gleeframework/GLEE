"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is reasonable, it's in Bob's best interest to see if he can get a better deal. The game is designed for negotiation, and Bob has the opportunity to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better with a more even split.  Let's try this for a more fair start.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's my turn, and time is ticking. This offer still gives us a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is still giving Bob a decent amount, it's still a significantly lower share than he proposed in the previous round.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to budge more in the next round. Even with the inflation, it's better to risk a bit and potentially get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This offer is closer to my previous proposal and still gives you a good share, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the money is shrinking. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3400 
# Alice gain: 6600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer, while less than ideal, is the best Bob can get at this point. The inflation is significant, and continuing to reject offers could lead to both of them getting nothing. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets something, and it's likely that if he rejects, Alice will not budge further in the next round."
