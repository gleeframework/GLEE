Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This is the fairest solution, and we can avoid the risk of further losses from inflation. Time is running out, and we need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the safest option. Inflation is steadily chipping away at my potential gains, and there's a real risk of walking away with nothing if this drags on. A guaranteed $500,000 is better than the gamble of continued negotiation."
