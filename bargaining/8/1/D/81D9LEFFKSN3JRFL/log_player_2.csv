"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understand the initial offer
Alice proposes to split the $100 evenly, which means both Alice and Bob would get $50 each.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
Since there's no inflation for Bob but a 5% decrease in value for Alice with each passing round, waiting could potentially give Bob more value in comparison to Alice in subsequent rounds.

## Step 3: Evaluate the fairness and potential gain
Given that the offer is fair and considering the inflation impact is only on Alice, there's no immediate reason to reject the offer for a potentially better deal in later rounds, especially since fairness is a good starting point.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
