I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to maximize my share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to accept the offer. Although I'm getting significantly less than my initial proposal,  the inflation factor means I'm likely to get even less if I reject and propose again. It's best to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing."
