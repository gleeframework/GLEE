"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to make the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding back 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a lower amount. However, Bob's offer is still better than my initial proposal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not budging much. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at the value of money, I'm getting more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too low for my taste, but I'm willing to consider it.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal than my previous one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower value money.
