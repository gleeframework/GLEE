I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though the money I get is worth less now, I'm still getting a decent amount, and it's better than risking another round and possibly getting even less."
