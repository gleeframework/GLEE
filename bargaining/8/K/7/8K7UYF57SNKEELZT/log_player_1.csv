"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game with a twist!  I'm going to start by taking a large portion of the money, hoping Bob will accept.  After all, 10 dollars is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  The money is worth less each round, so accepting a small amount now is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
