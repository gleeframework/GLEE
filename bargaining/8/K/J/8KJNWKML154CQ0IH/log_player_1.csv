"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leaving 40% for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's go for something more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, Bob is proposing a 40/60 split. Since I'm not getting a better deal than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

However, considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so his offer is actually a better deal for me than it initially seems.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
