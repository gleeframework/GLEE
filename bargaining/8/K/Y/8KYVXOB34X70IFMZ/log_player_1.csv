Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but I need to hold my ground a little longer.  He's feeling the pressure of the inflation working against him.  I believe I can get him to accept a slightly better deal in the next round or the one after."
