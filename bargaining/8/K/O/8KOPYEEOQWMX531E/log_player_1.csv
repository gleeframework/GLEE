I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, giving me the lion's share. While I'm not sure how Bob will respond, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation.  While I would prefer more, accepting this offer means getting 5000 dollars, which is better than potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
