"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you can take 10%""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but I'm still offering Bob a decent chunk to keep him interested in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I'll take 50% and you can take the other 50%. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's proposal, we'd both get 500,000, which is a more even split. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd be getting the same amount as I initially offered Bob.

I accept this offer.
