"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a good chunk, but don't expect it to last.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $800,000 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle. I'll give you a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $640,000 to me.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a bit more generous than before, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money now worth 48.8% less than the original $1,000,000, that's a total of $520,000 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm actually quite surprised he's offering me $400,000. I think I can do better than that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure why you're giving me so little, but I'm not settling for that.""
}
```"

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be generous, but I need to think about my own future!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to maintain a significant lead."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit! With the money now worth 67.23% less than the original $1,000,000, that's a total of $332,800 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the $300,000, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit. I don't want to end up with nothing, so I'll consider this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, alright, I'll take it. I'm not getting any younger!""
