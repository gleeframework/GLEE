Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I see how you want to play this. One more round, and that's it. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is clearly willing to push this to the limit, and her offers are only getting worse for me. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now guarantees I at least get something substantial before inflation eats away at her incentive to be fair."
