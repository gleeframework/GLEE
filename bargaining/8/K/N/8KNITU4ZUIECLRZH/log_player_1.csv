"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 700k and you can take 300k.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me taking $700,000 and Bob taking $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take less than you, but I think this is a fairer split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, the actual amount I'd get is $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, but it's a more even split than my initial offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 550k and you can take 450k. It's a fairer split than before.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me taking $550,000 and Bob taking $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50 and end this! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, the actual amount I'd get is $500,000 * 0.516 = $258,000.

A 50-50 split sounds reasonable, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
