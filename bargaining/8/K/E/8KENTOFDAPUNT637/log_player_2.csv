"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a good chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While it's tempting to take the $1000, it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round.  There's a chance she'll be willing to give more to secure a deal. Plus, by rejecting, you get to make the proposal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split it more evenly, let's get this done!""
