"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, hoping to secure a good portion of the money while it's still worth its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic shift in the distribution. I'll hold out and hope to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous counter-offer. I'm still aiming for a good portion, but I'm trying to find a balance that might be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed with the declining share, inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money. This offer, though not ideal, is a much better deal than the previous round's offer. I'll accept it to avoid further potential losses from inflation."
