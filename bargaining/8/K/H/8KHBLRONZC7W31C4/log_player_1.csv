"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  I'm assuming Bob doesn't know about the inflation yet, so I'll see if he takes it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is clearly just a flip of my first offer.  I'm not going to accept it!  I'm going to try and counter-offer and see if I can get a bit more.  This is getting interesting!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to try and counter with a slightly lower offer than my original proposal.  I still want a good chunk of the money, but I'm aware that Bob might be getting a little more wary of my aggressive approach.  I'm hoping to get a deal done before the inflation takes too big of a bite out of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is basically the same as my last offer, but worse because of inflation.  I'm not going to accept it.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to lower my offer again, but still keeping a majority of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob is starting to see the value of settling sooner rather than later, considering how inflation is working against him.  I'll see if he bites on this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being stubborn, but I'm holding my ground.  The inflation is seriously hurting him now, and he's essentially offering me the same deal as before, just worse because of the inflation.  I'm still hoping for a better deal, but I'm aware that we're running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a lower offer. The inflation is really starting to bite, and I need to get this settled. I'm hoping that Bob is starting to see the value of a deal, even if it's not exactly what he wanted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is essentially the same as my last one, but worse because of the inflation.  I'm not going to accept this.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round.  I'm starting to get worried though. The inflation is seriously cutting into my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but not by as much.  We're getting close to the end and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'm hoping that Bob is starting to realize that he needs to make a deal soon before the inflation completely eats away at his potential gains.  I'm nervous, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal."
