"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, I'm a fair player 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though Alice is being ""fair"" in her proposal, the inflation will significantly impact the value of the money in the next round. It's better to wait and see if Alice will offer a better deal when the money is worth less to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better with a more balanced split. Let's try 60/40 this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 50/50 this time 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's offer isn't as favorable as my previous offer, the inflation will continue to make my share worth less. Accepting the 50/50 split is the best option at this point, ensuring I at least get something out of the deal."
