I'm starting with a fair proposal, giving Bob slightly more. I'm hoping to get this game started and see if he's willing to accept a fair split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a fair offer and it's better to accept it rather than risk getting a worse deal in future rounds."
