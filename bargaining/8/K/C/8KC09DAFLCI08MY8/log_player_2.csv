Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation rates we're facing. It allows us both to get a decent amount, while still accounting for the devaluation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a slightly smaller share to acknowledge the inflation, but we need to find a middle ground.  How about 52/48? 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
