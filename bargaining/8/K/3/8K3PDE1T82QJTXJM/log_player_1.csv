"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, I'll have to consider that my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

However, Bob's offer of 70/30 is still a bit too low for me. I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In the third round, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round due to cumulative inflation (5% in the first round and another 5% in the second round).

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which seems more reasonable considering the decreasing value of money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of money!

Considering that my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I think Bob's offer of 75/25 is actually quite reasonable. I'm willing to accept it.
