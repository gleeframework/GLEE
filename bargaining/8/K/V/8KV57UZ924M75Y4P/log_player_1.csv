"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair starting offer, considering the inflation rates. It gives me a slight advantage due to the lower inflation rate, but it's not overly greedy. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even considering inflation. I will reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose an even split.  The inflation has hurt Bob more than me, so this is a fair offer that should be attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is still worse than my initial offer, the inflation is hitting him harder now.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm going to offer a split that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still gives me a slight advantage. The inflation is really starting to bite, so I need to be more flexible to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is unacceptable.  Even with the inflation hitting Bob harder, he's still trying to take a bigger share. I'll reject and try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite now, especially for Bob.  I'll make a final offer, giving him a larger share, but still ensuring I get a decent amount.  Hopefully, he'll accept before the inflation makes things even worse for both of us."
