I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he'll take it or try to negotiate for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge drop from the previous round, and I'm not going to accept it. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a split that's more even than Bob's offer, but still gives him a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll realize that he's not likely to get a better deal in the next round."
