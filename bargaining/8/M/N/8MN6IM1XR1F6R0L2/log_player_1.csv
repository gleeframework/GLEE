"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I'm hoping Bob will be surprised and accept quickly.  The inflation is a wildcard, but I'm assuming it will affect him more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer.  It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further inflation."
