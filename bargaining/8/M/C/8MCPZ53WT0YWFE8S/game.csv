600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $600,000, you get $400,000.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly with inflation looming over us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But I believe a more balanced split, with me taking 600k, would be better for both of us.  We can reach a deal quickly and avoid losing too much to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"I understand your point of view, Bob, but I believe a more equitable split is still possible. Let's not be hasty and aim for a more mutually beneficial outcome.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  This recognizes my initial offer while still giving us a good deal before inflation eats away more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I think a 55/45 split is fair. We both get a good amount, and we can move forward with this before the inflation eats away any more value. Let's agree on this and get this done.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, we're just going in circles now. I'm willing to be fair, but I won't be taken advantage of.  Let's not waste any more time with these tactics.",Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but we're running out of time. I'm proposing 525,000 for me and 475,000 for you. It's a small concession on my part, but it ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation causes further damage.",Alice,5,
