"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain in the same terms as before. However, I should take into account that Bob's gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 40% less for Bob (20% less than the first round, and another 20% less than the second round), I'll aim for a more favorable split. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
