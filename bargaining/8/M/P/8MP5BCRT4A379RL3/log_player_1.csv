Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think this split is more reflective of the fact that the value diminishes for you each round.  Let's make a deal!

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This offer is a good compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Although the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the initial amount due to inflation.  It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is cutting it close!  I'm taking a risk here, but I'm hopeful you'll see the value in closing this deal now.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough decision, but time is running out. While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures you get something.  Rejecting it carries the huge risk of getting nothing in the end, and with each round, the value for Alice diminishes greatly."
