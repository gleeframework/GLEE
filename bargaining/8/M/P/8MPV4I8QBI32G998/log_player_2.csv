Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let time run out! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is slightly better than before, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm betting she'll be more willing to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5050, ""alice_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is as close to even as it's going to get.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm nudging my offer slightly closer to even, showing some willingness to compromise. This puts pressure on Alice, who is feeling the impact of inflation more acutely. It's a gamble, but she might accept a less favorable deal now to avoid losing even more value as time runs out."
