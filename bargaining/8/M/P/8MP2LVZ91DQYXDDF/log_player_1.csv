"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

For Round 2, the effective amount I would gain is 40% of $100, which is $40. But due to inflation, this is now worth 80% of its original value, so I would actually gain $32.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal.

Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value due to inflation."
