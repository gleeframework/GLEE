"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. I think it's a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unbalanced.  I'm proposing a more even split this time.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, signaling that I'm aiming for a fairer outcome.
* **My Counter-Offer:**  While I want a larger share, I'm proposing a split closer to 50/50. This acknowledges that waiting benefits me more (due to the higher inflation rate for me), but also shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message aims to be polite but firm. I want Alice to understand I'm serious about getting a better deal."
