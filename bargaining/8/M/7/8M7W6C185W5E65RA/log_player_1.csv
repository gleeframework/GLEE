"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's share of $600,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal. My response is:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
