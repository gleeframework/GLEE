{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take the majority share this time.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering you took the bigger share last round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the one who should get the majority. This is a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500."
