"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value of money. I'd like to try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I'll have to be strategic.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more uneven split in my favor, but still trying to be reasonable and find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but still a small share for you 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'm getting worried that the value of my share is dwindling rapidly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before the value of my share becomes negligible."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is dropping rapidly due to inflation, so I need to make a more aggressive move.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, meet me here or I'll take what's left""
}
```

I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, trying to get a better share of the remaining value before it's too late."
