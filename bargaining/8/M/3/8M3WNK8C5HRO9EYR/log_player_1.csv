"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. Since we are in the first round, there's no inflation yet. I'm hoping Bob will be happy with a small cut and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject the offer. While it's better than nothing, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to 7000 for myself and 3000 for Bob. This is a compromise, as I'm still losing money due to inflation, but it's a fairer split than the previous offer. I hope Bob will accept this and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a considerable amount of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll accept and end the game."
