"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't want to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share than me, even if it's only by a small margin. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of its original value now. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a 50/50 split. Here's my decision:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the value of the money continuing to decrease."
