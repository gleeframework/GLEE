"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. The message is ""Let's split fairly"" to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness in the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth the same to me in this round as in the first, I can try to negotiate for a better split in the next round, potentially gaining more than $4,500. The message from Bob mentions considering inflation, but since inflation affects Bob's gain and not mine, I have an incentive to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $3,600 and keep $6,400 for myself. The message is ""Considering inflation, this is fair"" to acknowledge the impact of inflation on Bob's gain while still negotiating for a favorable split.\n{""alice_gain"": 6400, ""bob_gain"": 3600, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is fair""}"
