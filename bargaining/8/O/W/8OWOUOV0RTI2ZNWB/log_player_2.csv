Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40.  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but it's early in the game. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal."
