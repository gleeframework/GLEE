"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is designed to be very favorable to me (Alice), but still gives Bob a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept.  Since it's the first round and we don't know how inflation will affect Bob, it's better to start with a strong offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game.  It's tempting to accept, but rejecting and forcing Bob to make a more reasonable offer in the next round is the strategically sound choice.  The 5% inflation on Bob's side may make him more likely to compromise in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.  The fact that he rejected my generous offer in round 1 suggests he might be willing to accept something less than his ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to pressure me with a higher inflation rate on his gains, but I'm still not giving in.  I'll keep rejecting until we reach a more balanced agreement. It's still early in the game, and we have more rounds to go."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but not by as much as before. I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still expecting a significant share of the money. The higher inflation rate on Bob's gains might make him more willing to accept a lower offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to push for a very unequal split, even with the higher inflation rate on his side. I'm not giving up yet.  It's important to stay firm and show that I'm not desperate for a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm also increasing the amount Bob receives.  This shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but I still want a larger share of the money. The inflation on Bob's side is increasing, and it's becoming more likely he will accept a less favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very lopsided, even with the significant inflation on his gains. I will continue to reject until we reach a fairer division. We are getting close to the end of the game, and he will be feeling the pressure to make a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but it's now a much more even split.  The inflation on Bob's side is increasing, and he's losing a lot of value with each passing round. I'm betting that he'll realize it's better to accept a less favorable deal than risk getting nothing.  The pressure is on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to accept this offer, considering Bob's offer is only worth 63.02% of what he got in the first round, it's still unfair. I'm betting that the pressure of losing everything will force him to make a more equitable offer in the next round. We're nearing the end of the game, and I'm not giving up on getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're down to the wire, and with the significant inflation affecting Bob's gains, I'm proposing an equal split.  It's the fairest solution and the most likely to be accepted.  While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, I recognize that a 50/50 split is the best outcome we can achieve at this point. If Bob rejects this, we both get nothing, and that's a risk neither of us wants to take."
