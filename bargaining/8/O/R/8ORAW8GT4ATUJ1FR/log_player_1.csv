Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high offer for myself, but leaving Bob with something to hopefully encourage acceptance.  It's a risky move, but it might pay off!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
