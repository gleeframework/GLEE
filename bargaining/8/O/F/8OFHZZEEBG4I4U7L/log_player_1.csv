"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer, but give myself a larger share since I get to propose first. I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures a guaranteed 50% of the remaining value, whereas rejecting it risks ending up with nothing if Bob remains stubborn in future rounds."
