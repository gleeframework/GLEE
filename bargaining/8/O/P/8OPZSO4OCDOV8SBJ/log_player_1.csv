"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering future losses""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and taking $6000 for myself, considering that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for me than for Bob. This division seems fair given the conditions, as it gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging the greater depreciation I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation rate. It gives us both a good starting point for the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting 4500 in the second round means I'd actually be getting significantly less value than if I'd received that amount in the first round. Since I started by offering Bob a 60/40 split and considering the steeper depreciation I face, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable division for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the greater loss I face, this is a more balanced offer""}\n\nGiven that the money's value decreases more rapidly for me, I'm adjusting my initial offer slightly to 58/42, still aiming for a fair division that acknowledges the unequal impact of inflation on our gains. This proposal is a compromise, recognizing the need for both of us to walk away with a substantial amount while also addressing the disparate effects of depreciation."
