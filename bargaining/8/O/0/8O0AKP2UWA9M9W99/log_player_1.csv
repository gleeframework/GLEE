"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. We can both get a good amount, and it's better than taking a smaller percentage later due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
