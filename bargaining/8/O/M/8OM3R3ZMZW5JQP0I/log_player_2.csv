"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in both our best interests. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The current proposal gives me 30% of the money, but I think I can negotiate for more. Since the money loses value over time, I need to balance the potential gain with the risk of losing value in subsequent rounds. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a significant share, and we don't lose too much value due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The offer is getting worse for you, Bob. Time is running out. Let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer has increased from the initial 300,000, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is significantly less than in the first round. Given that we have multiple rounds left, I'll continue to negotiate for a better deal, hoping that Alice will be willing to compromise further as the rounds progress. The pressure of potentially losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds might prompt her to offer more in subsequent rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss of value over time. This offer is still reasonable and gives you more than half the total amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is almost the same offer as before but with inflation, it's actually better for you! Take the deal while you can. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's message tries to frame this offer as better due to inflation, the fact remains that the actual value I would gain continues to decrease significantly with each round. At this point, the money I would gain is worth nearly 60% less than in the first round. Given the substantial loss in value and the fact that we are not yet halfway through the negotiations, I will continue to push for a better deal. The risk of walking away with nothing is still not as pressing as the potential reward of securing a more favorable offer in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""We're halfway through the negotiations, and the impact of inflation is becoming more significant. I propose we split the amount equally to simplify the process and ensure we both get a substantial share before the money loses even more value.""}"
