I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping to secure a quick agreement. I think it's better to get a smaller amount now than risk losing more to inflation later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would have preferred a larger share, I think accepting this offer is the best option.  There is no guarantee that I will be able to get a better deal in the next round, and the inflation risk means that my share will decrease with each round.  5000 dollars is a decent amount, and it's better to secure it than to risk getting nothing."
