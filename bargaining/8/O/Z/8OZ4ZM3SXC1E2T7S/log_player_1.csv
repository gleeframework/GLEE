"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems fair to me for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $50 is worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
