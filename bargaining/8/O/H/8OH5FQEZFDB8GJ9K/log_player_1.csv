"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'm not too thrilled about taking 20% of the reduced amount. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 30% now, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can sense it. Better make a better offer next time! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the further reduction in value, I'm not thrilled about taking 15% of the reduced amount. I'll try to negotiate again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to think strategically!

Given the rapid inflation, I'll aim for a smaller but more realistic percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```"
