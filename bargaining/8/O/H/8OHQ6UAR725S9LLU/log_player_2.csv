Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand your desire for a more even split, but the inflation is working against me. I'm willing to compromise, but this offer needs to account for the shrinking pot. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
