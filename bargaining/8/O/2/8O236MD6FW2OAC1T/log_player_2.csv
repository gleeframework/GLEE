"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for your next message."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about we split it 55-45?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is working against you, Bob, but your offer was too far in your favor. I'm willing to compromise slightly. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll take what I can get before it loses even more value."
