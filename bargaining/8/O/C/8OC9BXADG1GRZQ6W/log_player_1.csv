"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 50 dollars, and I'll take the other 50 dollars. This is a fair and straightforward proposal to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
