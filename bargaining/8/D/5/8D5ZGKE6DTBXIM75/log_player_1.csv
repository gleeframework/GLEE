"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to be greedy and take most of the money. I figure Bob is more likely to take a small amount than risk getting nothing if he rejects my offer and then I get to propose again in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  I'm still hoping to get most of the money, and I'm confident I can make a better deal if I get to propose next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is still a very generous offer to Bob, but I'm willing to give up a bit more to ensure I get a deal and avoid any further risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though I'm getting less than I wanted, it's still a decent amount of money, and the risk of inflation is getting too high. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
