"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, now it's your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me with a very uneven split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. It's not a fair split, and I'm willing to negotiate further. My turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You can't have all the money, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me a very good deal, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is trying to take the lion's share!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. A 10/90 split is extremely unfair, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal this time:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but you need to meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a decent compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really pushing it now, Alice. This is my last offer! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting desperate!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. A 5/95 split is completely unacceptable. I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share, especially after I've been pushing for a fairer split. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a strong final offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not backing down on the majority of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split, which is a fair compromise, but still in my favor. If Bob accepts, I'll take the majority of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
