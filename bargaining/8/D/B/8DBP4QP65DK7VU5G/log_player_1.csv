"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a fair split, and if Bob accepts, we can end the game right here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $7,000 is worth $5,600 (since 20% of $7,000 is $1,400, and $7,000 - $1,400 = $5,600) and Bob's gain of $3,000 is worth $2,850 (since 5% of $3,000 is $150, and $3,000 - $150 = $2,850).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, but I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up much more, but I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $5,500 is worth $2,880 (since 48.8% of $5,500 is $2,696, and $5,500 - $2,696 = $2,804, but I'll round it to $2,880 for simplicity) and Bob's gain of $4,500 is worth $4,062.50 (since 14.26% of $4,500 is $642.75, and $4,500 - $642.75 = $3,857.25, but I'll round it to $4,062.50 for simplicity).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, but I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. It's the fairest way to end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
