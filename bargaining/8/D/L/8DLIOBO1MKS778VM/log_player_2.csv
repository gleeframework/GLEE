"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money will be worth less in future rounds for me, and I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. I'm willing to negotiate further if you have any suggestions.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. We both get a fair share, and we don't need to keep going through this back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though a 50/50 split seems fair, I know that I can potentially get a better deal for myself if we continue to negotiate. I'm still hopeful that Alice will come around to a split that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a larger share. How about 65/35?  We can both walk away with something worthwhile, and we don't have to keep negotiating forever.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but let's meet in the middle with a 45/55 split. This is my final offer before inflation makes things even worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm aware that the inflation is making the money worth less with each round. Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
