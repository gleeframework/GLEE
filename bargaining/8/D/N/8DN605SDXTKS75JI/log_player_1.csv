"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less this round, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer. I don't think it's fair that I'd get only 40% of the total, especially since the value of the money is already decreasing. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm making the proposal this round. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not much.""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive this round, but not too greedy, since the money is still worth 10% less than in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair split. Let's keep going! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my share is really dwindling. However, I still think 45 is a bit too low, considering I'm making the next proposal in the next round.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one from Bob.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 55 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle this round.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this round, but not too greedy, considering the money is still worth less than in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to get closer to a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting yet.

Considering the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, $50 is actually a relatively good offer for me. However, I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet.

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to make a better offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up more than 42. I think this is a fair compromise given the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive this round, but still leaving some room for negotiation. The money is worth even less than before, so I need to be careful not to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I think I deserve a bit more. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less than before, and I'm getting desperate. However, I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 48/52 split, even if it's a bit more favorable to me.

Considering the value of the money, $52 is actually a relatively good offer for me. But I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up the remaining 2% to Bob.

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to make a better offer in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40. I think this is the best I can do, and I hope you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm being more aggressive this round, trying to get as much as I can, but I'm not sure if it's enough. The money is worth a lot less than in the first round, and I'm starting to get worried that we'll end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I think we can find a way to split it 50/50. Let's try to make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get a 50/50 split again, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Considering the money is worth 61.26% less than in the first round, $50 is actually a relatively good offer for me.

However, I've been rejecting offers that were close to this for a while now, and I'm starting to think that a 50/50 split might be the best option. I don't want to risk losing out on a decent offer, especially with so few rounds left.

I'll accept this offer and hope that it's the best I can get.
