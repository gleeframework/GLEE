"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob!

I'll think about it... I'd rather get more than 550,000, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

Since my money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and Bob's money is worth 5% less, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the significant drop in value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is closer to the original 50/50 split, I'll consider it a decent compromise.
