"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split, in my favor this time, is fairer considering inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 55 for you is too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to account for the inflation and make a more balanced offer, while still keeping some value for myself."
