"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a better reflection of our contributions.  Let's be fair but also acknowledge the value we each bring. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it for now. I think I can do better than 45.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm looking for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give myself a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
