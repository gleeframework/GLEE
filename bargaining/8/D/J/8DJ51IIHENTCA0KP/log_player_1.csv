"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also preparing for a long game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly! It's the fairest way to start. We can always negotiate more later if we want. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my negotiating power just yet. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous with the even split. I'll take 60, but you can have the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept it!"
