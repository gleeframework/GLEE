"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a fair offer, considering the inflation effects are not yet as strong. I am taking advantage of the fact that Bob's money is losing value slower than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not fair. He's taking advantage of the inflation rate, but my money is losing value faster than his. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm sticking with the 55/45 split, but this time in my favor. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation. If he rejects, we're both losing more money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation. My money is losing value much faster than Bob's, and we're both losing a lot of money with each passing round. Accepting this offer will at least save us from getting nothing in the end."
