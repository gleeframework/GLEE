"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  I'm taking a big chunk, but leaving enough for Bob to feel like it's worth his while to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and while my share has decreased due to inflation, it's still a lot higher than what Bob is offering. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping it significantly higher than what Bob offered in the previous round. My hope is that he sees the potential loss from the inflation and is willing to accept a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share has decreased significantly due to inflation, Bob's offer is now more favorable than my previous proposals. It's still a loss for me compared to my initial round 1 offer, but I'm willing to take it to avoid further risk of even lower offers in future rounds."
