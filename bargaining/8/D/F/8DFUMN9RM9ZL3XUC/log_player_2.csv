This is a very uneven split, and I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal for myself in later rounds."

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate. Let's split it 60/40, acknowledging the time pressure but also my need to secure a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is feeling the time pressure, but this offer is still tilted in her favor. I think I can push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I still believe we can find a fairer split. Let's go 50/50 and avoid any further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer, especially considering the time pressure and the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains. Accepting now secures me a reasonable share and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
