Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money.  My last offer was a bit high, yours was a bit low. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.  65/35 seems fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
