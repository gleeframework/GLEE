"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's make a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll get 80% of the previous gain, which is $720,000.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
