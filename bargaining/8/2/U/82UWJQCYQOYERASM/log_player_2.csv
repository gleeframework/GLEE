Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and this is getting us nowhere. I'm standing firm. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but her offer is increasingly worse for me each round.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a reasonable share. While the shrinking pot is concerning, accepting a bad deal now will leave me with much less in the long run. I'll hold out a bit longer and hope she becomes more amenable to a fairer split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

After five rounds, it's clear Alice is aiming for a larger share but also doesn't want to walk away empty-handed.  By now, the inflation is significantly impacting both of us. Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Demonstrates fairness:** This is objectively equitable and might appeal to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Highlights urgency:** The shrinking pot due to inflation makes further haggling riskier for both of us. 
* **Sets a firm boundary:** It shows I'm serious about not accepting a deal where I lose significantly more than Alice due to the inflation mechanic."
