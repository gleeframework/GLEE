"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is 60/40 in his favor, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

Considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept it."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offers.

I'll reject this offer since it's still a 55/45 split in Bob's favor, and the value of the money I gain is still the same as in the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
