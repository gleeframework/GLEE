Let's see what Alice offers next.  It's early in the game, and I'm hoping for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to propose a more even split, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept in the early rounds. I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself later on if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to play it safe, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm not going to settle for a 50/50 split yet.  The inflation is starting to hit, but I still have a few rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my offer to try and entice Alice.  I'm still holding out for a majority share, but I need to be mindful of the increasing inflation.  This offer keeps the division relatively even, and I believe it could be enticing enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  While this isn't the ideal split, it's better than getting nothing and Alice is likely to reject any further proposals from me. I'll take it!"
