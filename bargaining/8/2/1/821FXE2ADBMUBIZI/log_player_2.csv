Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  But let's be realistic - this back and forth is costing us both money! I propose a fair 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
