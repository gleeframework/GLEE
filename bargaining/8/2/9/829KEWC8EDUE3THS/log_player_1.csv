"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we can both get a good chunk. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the fairest way, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to propose a different offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think it's fair considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob receives 40%, which is $4,000."
