"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The money loses value rapidly for both of us. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Exploiting Discount Rates:** Alice's money loses value faster than mine. This gives me some leverage in later rounds.
* **Reasonable Offer:** My offer is tilted in my favor but still provides Alice with a decent amount compared to waiting for future rounds where the money will be worth even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less money there is to be gained for both of us.  
* **Alice's Offer Is Improved:** Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split after accounting for the inflation, and it's better than what I could likely get in round 4 after another round of devaluation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting carries the risk of getting even less in future rounds if Alice plays hardball. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
