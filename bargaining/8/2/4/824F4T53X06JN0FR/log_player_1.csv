"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my end. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take a toll on my end. Considering the decreasing value of my potential gain, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer, as I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation."
