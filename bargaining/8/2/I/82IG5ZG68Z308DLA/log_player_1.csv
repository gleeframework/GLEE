Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering we both lose value over time. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
