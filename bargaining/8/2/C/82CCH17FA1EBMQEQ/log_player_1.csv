"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I think a 60/40 split is more equitable, considering the inflation we're facing.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script on me!

However, I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is more equitable, especially since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'd like to propose a compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split yet. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?""
}
```

I'm hoping to find a middle ground that takes into account the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. How about this 55.5/44.5 split?""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55.5/44.5, trying to find a balance that takes into account the changing value of the money."
