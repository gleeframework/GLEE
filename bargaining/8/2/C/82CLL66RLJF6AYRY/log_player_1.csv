"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take $999,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This is a very generous offer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is even worse than the previous one, with Bob taking almost everything. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal. The inflation factor is in my favor this round, so I'm hoping to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm willing to concede some ground, but I'm still going to aim for a larger share. I'm offering 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still unacceptable. While the inflation is working against Bob, I'm still in a good position to negotiate a better deal. I'm confident that I can secure a larger share of the money in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to try a more moderate approach this time. I'm offering Bob 50,000, which is a significant increase from the previous round. This should demonstrate my willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money."

# Alice gain: 50000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still a terrible deal for me. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to take most of the money.  I'm going to hold out for a better offer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000 this round. This is a significant increase from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money. With inflation working against Bob, I believe he might be more willing to accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a bad deal for me. I'm going to continue to try to negotiate a better split. The inflation is starting to hurt Bob, and I'm confident I can secure a more favorable outcome."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000 this round.  This is a significant increase from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. I believe this offer is fair and should be acceptable given the continued inflation.  I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money, but I'm starting to feel the pressure as we approach the end of the game."

# Alice gain: 300000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still not a good deal for me.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept an offer that gives him such a large share of the money. I'm going to try to negotiate a better split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
