"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I think it's important to be generous to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is technically generous, it's not very fair. With 12 rounds to go, I'd rather try to negotiate a more balanced split."
