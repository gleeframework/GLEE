"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60/40, I'll try 55/45. Fairer for you this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 55/45 is a significant improvement from 60/40, and I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'll take 55.5/44.5 this time""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, with me getting 550,000 and Bob getting 450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to 55/45, I'll meet you halfway at 52.5/47.5. Let's settle! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept the 52.5/47.5 split. It's not perfect, but it's close enough to the 55/45 I was aiming for, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money decreasing in value. I'll take the 450,000 and call it a day!"
