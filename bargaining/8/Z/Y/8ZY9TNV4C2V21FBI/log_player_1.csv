"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start fresh with a 50/50 split. No need to negotiate too much, we can split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 9,000 * 0.9 = 8,100.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
