"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I should try to get a better offer from Alice in the early rounds. Alice's initial offer of 1000 for me and 9000 for her is not fair, considering the decreasing value of money for me. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide the money more fairly, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\nReasoning: Given the 20% decrease in value for me each round, I need to aim for a higher amount in the early rounds. Offering 6000 for myself and 4000 for Alice is a more balanced proposal, taking into account the impact of inflation on my share. This offer also leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than your last offer to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although Alice has increased her offer to me to 4000, considering the 36% decrease in value due to inflation, this amount is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Given that we are still in the early rounds, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal, as accepting this offer might not be the optimal outcome for me. I will reject this offer and continue to the next round, aiming for a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to compromise but still need a fairer split to account for the loss in value.""}\n\nReasoning: Given the increasing impact of inflation, which now makes my gain worth 36% less, I need to adjust my strategy to ensure I get a reasonable amount. By offering 5500 for myself and 4500 for Alice, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the effects of inflation on my share while still being mindful of Alice's perspective. This approach aims to encourage Alice to accept the offer or make a more favorable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to avoid further rounds of negotiation.  Let's settle on this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Despite Alice's slight increase in her offer to 4500, the impact of inflation, which now makes my gain worth 59.04% less than in the first round, significantly diminishes the value of this offer. Given that we are only halfway through the negotiation rounds, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a better deal that more adequately compensates for the loss in value due to inflation. Rejecting this offer and continuing to the next round may provide an opportunity for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering we're halfway through and the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose an equal split to simplify the negotiation and account for the loss in value I'm facing.""}\n\nReasoning: Given the substantial decrease in value for my share due to inflation (59.04% less than the first round), and considering we are at the midpoint of the negotiations, I'm opting for a straightforward approach by proposing an equal split of 5000 for both Alice and me. This offer aims to balance the negotiation, taking into account the disproportionate effect of inflation on my potential gain, and may appeal to Alice as a fair and simple resolution to conclude the negotiations efficiently."
