"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. This is a relatively equal split, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiation."
