"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's inflation dynamics. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed more balanced, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 70-30 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly better split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split this time, let's see if you accept!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor, but still a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time. However, I'd like to push for a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping he'll meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim for a more aggressive split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close to the end, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which is a bit more in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the game!"
