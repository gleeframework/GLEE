"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, Bob is being offered a significantly smaller share than Alice, which might seem unfair given that the difference in their shares is substantial. Considering the impact of inflation, where the value of money decreases with each round, Bob might be motivated to try and negotiate a better deal, especially since he has 12 rounds to come to an agreement. Accepting the first offer without attempting to negotiate could be seen as not taking full advantage of the game's structure to possibly secure a more favorable outcome. Therefore, Bob decides to reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make his own proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven that we have a significant number of rounds ahead and considering the inflation rates affecting both of our earnings, my strategy will be to aim for a more balanced distribution while also factoring in the decreasing value of money over time. Since Alice's initial offer was significantly skewed in her favor, my counteroffer will aim to bring the shares closer to parity, while also considering that I am slightly more pressured by the inflation rate than Alice. Thus, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me to counterbalance the initial offer and to account for the higher inflation rate affecting my share.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Aiming for a more balanced start considering the inflation impact.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up some more to avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice has increased her offer to Bob, considering the impact of inflation, Bob's share of $4000 in round 3 is actually worth less than it would have been in round 1 due to the 36% decrease in value. Given that there are still 9 rounds left and the fact that Alice is less affected by inflation, Bob may believe he can negotiate a better deal that compensates for the loss in value over time. Additionally, Alice's willingness to ""meet in the middle"" suggests she may be open to further negotiation as the rounds progress and inflation continues to affect both parties' potential gains. Thus, Bob decides to reject the offer and proceed to the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","As the game progresses and inflation continues to erode the value of the money, it becomes increasingly important to reach a deal that compensates for this loss in value. Given that Alice was willing to ""meet in the middle"" in the previous round, my next offer will aim to find a compromise that is closer to the middle ground but still considers the inflationary impact on my potential gains. Since I am more affected by inflation, my strategy will be to propose a division that slightly adjusts from my previous offer to make it more palatable to Alice while ensuring I do not undervalue my share too significantly.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust to find a more suitable middle ground.""}"
