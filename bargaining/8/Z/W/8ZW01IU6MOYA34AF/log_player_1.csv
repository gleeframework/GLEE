"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This is a reasonable starting point, considering the value of the money decreases over time, and I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I'm losing money faster with each round. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor. Although the value of the money is decreasing, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, considering Bob is losing value faster than I am. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 52-48 split in my favor, with the message ""Meet me in the middle"". This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'm willing to find a mutually acceptable solution, but I'm still aiming for a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
