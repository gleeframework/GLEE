"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 90% of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is 45 * 0.9 = 40.5. 

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal for me than the 50-50 split I initially proposed.
