I'm making one last attempt at compromise. I'm offering a slightly smaller share for myself and a larger share for Bob. With inflation continuing, I'm hopeful this will be a fair deal for both of us and we can finally reach an agreement."

Even though I'm losing a huge chunk of money due to inflation, I cannot accept this offer. It's simply too unfair. It seems like Bob is deliberately trying to take most of the money, and I refuse to let him get away with it.  While I'm sad to lose out on the entire million, I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such a grossly unequal division."
