"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any potential disagreements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to consider the value of the money more carefully.

I'll reject this offer. I think 40 is a bit low, considering the initial offer was 50/50 and I'm already getting a worse deal due to the inflation. I'd like to propose an alternative. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think I'll do better than that. Can I propose a new offer?""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share this round, but I'm still not giving up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now that I've rejected your offers twice. I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm getting a worse deal with each passing round. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
