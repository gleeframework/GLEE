Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the previous round, Alice.  However, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a fairer reflection of the risks involved with inflation, especially considering the higher rate for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
