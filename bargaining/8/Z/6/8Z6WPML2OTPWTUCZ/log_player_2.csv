* **Time Pressure:** Only 3 rounds left! If I reject, I'm putting a lot of faith in getting a better deal before time runs out.
* **Inflation:**  This offer is worth significantly less than it appears due to the 56.95% inflation. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  She's clearly betting on me caving due to the time pressure. 

However, accepting this offer would mean I'm losing a huge portion of the potential gains. I need to hold my ground a little longer.
