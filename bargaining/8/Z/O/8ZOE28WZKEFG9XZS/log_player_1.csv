"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the money will depreciate if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my valuation of the proposal is:

My gain: 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000
Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.9 = 495,000

I think this is a good deal for me, considering the money will continue to depreciate. I accept the offer.
