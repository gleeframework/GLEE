Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed for my liking.  Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good deal considering the money will be worth less if we wait. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
