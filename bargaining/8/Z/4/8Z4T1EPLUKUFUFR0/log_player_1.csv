"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, taking 90% of the money. It's important to secure a large share early on, especially with the potential for inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible! He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving up my share that easily. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low.  He's trying to exploit inflation to take an even bigger share.  I'm sticking to my position and rejecting this offer.  There's still plenty of time left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time only to 80%. I'm hoping that Bob will start to realize that he needs to compromise to get a deal.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than Bob is offering, but I need to show that I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer is still completely unacceptable. He's trying to take advantage of inflation to get the vast majority of the money, and I'm not going to let him. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm not going to let him bully me into accepting this unfair offer."

Bob's offer is still way too low. He's clearly trying to exploit inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting his offers. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not going to give in to his bullying tactics."

```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're getting dangerously close to the end of the game.  I'm not going to give in to his demands.  Even if I get nothing, it's better than accepting such a lopsided deal.  The next round, I will need to be more aggressive and find a way to secure a better outcome for myself."
