I'm going for a greedy start, aiming for the majority of the money!  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's still a decent amount considering the inflation."
