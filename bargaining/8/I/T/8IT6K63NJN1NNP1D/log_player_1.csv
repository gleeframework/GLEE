"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2,500. I believe this is fair given the risk and uncertainty of future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. I'm offering a more balanced 2:1 ratio. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
