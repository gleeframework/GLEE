I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking a larger share due to the greater inflation rate I'm facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than the last round's, it's still not fair considering the inflation difference. I'm going to try and push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor, which is closer to a 50/50 split than Bob's previous offer. This takes into account the inflation differential, and I believe it's a fair compromise."
