Do you accept this offer?","Bob has made an offer of $5000 for both of us, suggesting it's his final offer for a 50/50 split. However, considering the inflation effect, his $5000 is actually worth significantly less than mine. Given that this is not truly an equal split in value due to the inflation and that he claims it's his final offer, I'll reject this to see if he's bluffing or if I can get a better deal later.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision. \n###"

However, considering the significant impact of inflation on his gain, his $4500 is actually worth much less in real value compared to the start.

However, considering the number of rounds that have passed and the risk of not reaching an agreement before the 12 rounds are over, I'll accept this offer as it guarantees me a significant amount, and further negotiations might not yield a substantially better outcome.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision. \n###"
