Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough spot, and the pressure from inflation is on. However, Alice is clearly trying to push for a larger share. Rejecting this round sends a strong signal that I'm not going to simply cave in as the value decreases for me.  There's still time, but I might need to make a more appealing offer soon to avoid walking away with nothing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Serious compromise 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is agonizing, but I have to hold strong.  Alice is clearly aware that the clock is working against me, and she's offering increasingly worse deals. Accepting now would mean losing almost half the value I could have had initially.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, even if it means risking everything."
