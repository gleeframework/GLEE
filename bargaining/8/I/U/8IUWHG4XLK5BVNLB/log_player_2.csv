Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. This makes it less likely she'll accept a deal favoring her in later rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** With each rejection, the potential gain for both sides diminishes.  The risk of getting nothing in the end increases substantially.
* **Shift in Power:**  Alice's offers have become more reasonable. Her initial 70/30 split is now a near-even 55/45. This suggests a willingness to compromise due to the time pressure.

**While Bob might hope for a slightly better deal, the risk of waiting any longer outweighs the potential for a marginal gain.**"
