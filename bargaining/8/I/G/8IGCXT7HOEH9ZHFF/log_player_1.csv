Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to accept a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all. Inflation has eaten away at my gains significantly, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in the future. It's time to take what I can get."
