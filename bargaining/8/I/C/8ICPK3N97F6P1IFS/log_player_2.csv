"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the bigger share, but you get something too.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject and try to negotiate something more favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the money will lose value with each round.  Let's get this done and both get a decent share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worth it for me. This is my final offer before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. The money is rapidly losing value, and Alice is clearly standing firm. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than ideal."
