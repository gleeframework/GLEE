"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and give Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 in this round is actually worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round. So, in terms of actual purchasing power, I'd be getting $4000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
