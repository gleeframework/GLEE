"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation penalty he'll face if he rejects it. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement. Additionally, Bob is under pressure due to the inflation penalty, which means he will lose value if the game continues. I'll try to leverage this to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers.""}\n\nI'm trying to appear reasonable by suggesting a compromise between our previous offers. However, I'm still taking advantage of Bob's inflation penalty and trying to get a better deal for myself. By offering a slight concession, I'm hoping to create a sense of progress and encourage Bob to accept this offer."
