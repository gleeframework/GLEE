"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and we both benefit from closing the deal early. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  We're both losing out the longer this drags on. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the impact of inflation, her offer is barely better than her first one. We need to push for a more significant shift in our favor while time is still on our side."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the time pressure we both face.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It's still in your favor considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  Alice is digging in, and while her offer isn't ideal, the impact of inflation is rapidly eroding our potential gains. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we push further and fail."
