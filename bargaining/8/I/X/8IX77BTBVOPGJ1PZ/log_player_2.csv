**Reasoning:**

Bob is in a very bad position. The value of the money is plummeting for him with each round.  It's clear Alice is willing to play hardball and wait for the best possible outcome for herself. 

* **Matching Alice's Offer:** Bob is now offering what Alice originally offered in Round 1. While this is a bad deal for Bob considering the inflation, it might be his last chance to get anything close to reasonable.
* **Strong Message:**  The message conveys Bob's frustration and implies he is at his limit. This could push Alice to accept, knowing if she rejects this, Bob might refuse to negotiate further. 

It's a desperate move, but Bob's back is against the wall."
