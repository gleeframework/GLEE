"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering that the money is worth 10% less for me than it was in the first round. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not accepting this offer. It's my turn to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on a 55/45 split. It's still a fair deal considering the inflation.""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to protect my own interests in the face of inflation."
