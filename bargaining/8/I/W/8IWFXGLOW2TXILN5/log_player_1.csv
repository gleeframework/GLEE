"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split, as both of us should benefit equally from this division. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an equal split, as I'd like to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since the money is worth less for me due to inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
