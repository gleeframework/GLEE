"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not happy with a 60/40 split. I propose a 55/45 split, which is still more for you since you made the first offer. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
