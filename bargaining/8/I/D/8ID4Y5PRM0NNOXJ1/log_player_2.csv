**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's right that my negotiating position weakens with each round. However, accepting 43% when I could have had 47% two rounds ago is a bad deal.  I'm hoping she'll get nervous as we get closer to the deadline and offer a larger share to guarantee she gets something."
