"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'd get $600,000 and Bob would get $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'd actually get $480,000 (60% of $800,000, which is 20% less than $1,000,000).

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'm not getting a good deal. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the second round, which was 20% less than the first round). So, the money is worth 64% of its original value.

I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which I think is a fair deal given the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 52.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value for Alice, but since I'm getting 48% of the original value, I'll get 51.2% of the 48% which is 24.576% of the original value, but I'll simplify this to 48.8% of the original value being 480,000 and 51.2% being 512,000, but since I'm getting 48% I'll get 48.8% of 800,000 which is 384,000).

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'd rather get more than 384,000. I'll wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money is worth 49.04% of its original value (100% - 50.96% = 49.04% of the original value for Alice, but since I'm getting 48% of the original value, I'll get 47.52% of the original value).

I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""A slight concession to get a deal done!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 38-62 split, which I think is a reasonable deal given the decreasing value of the money."
