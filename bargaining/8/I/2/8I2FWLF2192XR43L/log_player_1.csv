"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but it's still a good starting point. Let's see how you like it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'd like to negotiate a better deal. However, I'll still consider Bob's offer. 

I'll accept this offer for now, but I'm keeping an eye on the numbers.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
