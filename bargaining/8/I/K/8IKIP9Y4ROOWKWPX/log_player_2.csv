**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Diminishing Returns:**  The inflation is severe. Accepting $460,000 now, even with Alice getting more, is better than risking getting a smaller share in later rounds or even reaching round 12 and getting nothing.
* **Uncertain Outcome:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even stick to her guns, pushing the game closer to the no-win scenario.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the game carries a significant risk for a potentially small reward. It's better to secure a reasonable sum now than gamble on an increasingly uncertain future."
