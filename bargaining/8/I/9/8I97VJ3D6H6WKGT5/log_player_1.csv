Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, considering the inflation factor.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully.

However, I think I can do better than 30% for myself, considering the value of the money is still the same for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increasing inflation rate affecting Bob's gain.

Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
