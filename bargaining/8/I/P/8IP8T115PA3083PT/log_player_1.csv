"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 80% and leave you with 20% for now. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm taking the majority of the money, but leaving Bob with a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to increase it if you make a counteroffer next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob! Given that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

Since I'm still getting a significant amount of money, I'll decide to...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
