"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking only $2000, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, but not too far in!""
}
```

I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking only $3500, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $3500 and end the game, hoping it's the best I can get."
