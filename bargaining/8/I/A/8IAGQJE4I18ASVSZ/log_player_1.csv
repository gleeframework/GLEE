"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking almost all of the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a classic negotiation tactic to see if Bob is willing to accept even a tiny amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would love to get more, it is in my best interest to accept this offer. The inflation rate means each round I reject will result in a significantly smaller payout for me, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm willing to take it."
