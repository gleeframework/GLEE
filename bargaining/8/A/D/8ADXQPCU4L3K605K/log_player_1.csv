Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this generous offer or face the consequences of further inflation! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is trying to sound intimidating, the deal is getting significantly worse for him due to inflation.  He's getting desperate. By rejecting this offer, I'm betting he'll be much more reasonable in the next round as the value of his potential earnings continues to plummet."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it, or watch the value of your potential winnings dwindle even further. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** The message is designed to apply significant pressure on Bob. He's been warned multiple times about inflation eroding his potential gains. 
* **""Final Offer"":**  This phrasing creates a sense of urgency and implies that I'm unwilling to negotiate further.
* **""Fair Deal"":** While slightly in my favor, presenting it as ""fair"" might make it more palatable for Bob to accept rather than risk further losses.

This offer balances my desire for a significant share with the need to end the game before Bob's potential gains diminish to the point where he'll accept almost anything."
