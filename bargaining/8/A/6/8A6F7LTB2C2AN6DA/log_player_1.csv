"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, aiming to get the majority of the money. However, Bob might reject it, hoping for a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is significantly better than the previous one, it's still not fair. With inflation, the 1000$ I'd receive is worth less than it was in the first round, and Bob gets a disproportionate share. I'll reject this offer and see if he'll adjust his proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is more balanced than the previous ones. Due to inflation, I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid further losses. However, I still aim for a more equitable split."
