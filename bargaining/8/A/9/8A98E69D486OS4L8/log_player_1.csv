"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose taking $9,000 and leaving $1,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small share, but also leaves me with the majority.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it seems like a ""fair"" split on the surface, remember that the money is worth less now! My share of $5,000 is worth less than $4,500 from the previous round. Bob's offer is actually a slight loss for me compared to the last round. I'll make a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. This is a better deal for me than Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will incentivize him to accept. It also gives him a larger share than my initial offer, so hopefully he'll see it as a step in the right direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob is offering me more than in the previous round, it's still significantly less than my initial offer, and the inflation is really starting to bite. My share is worth less than $3,000 from the first round. I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself.  This is a compromise from my last offer, but it still leaves me with a larger share. Hopefully, Bob sees that I'm willing to negotiate and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is offering me more than in the previous round, it's still significantly less than my initial offer, and the inflation is eating away at my share.  My share of $3,000 is worth less than $2,000 from the first round. I need to hold out for a better deal, even though time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

The time for stubbornness is over. With inflation hitting us both hard, I'm offering an even 50/50 split. This is the most equitable solution given the circumstances, and I believe it's in our best interest to end this negotiation before we both lose out entirely."
