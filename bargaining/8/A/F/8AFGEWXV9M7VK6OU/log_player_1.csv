Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer wasn't unfair considering the inflation, but it heavily favored you. Let's meet closer to the middle ground this time. I'm proposing a more balanced split that acknowledges the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
