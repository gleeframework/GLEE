Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more fairness, 55-45 is more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, I need a bigger share to make up for it. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely, accepting this offer would still leave me with significantly less. It's important to hold my ground and emphasize the fairness of my initial proposal, especially as time runs out."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a compromise considering the time pressure and the impact inflation is having on us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds left, the pressure is on.  
* **Inflation Impact:** While my losses are less than Bob's, continuing to deadlock helps neither of us.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  This offer is a move towards Bob's position, but still favors me. It signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a better outcome than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time's running out, I need a bigger share to offset the huge inflation hit I'm taking. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are reflecting that. While I am also feeling the pressure of inflation and time, accepting this would be a significant loss compared to even my compromised offer. I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose if we don't settle now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With only 6 rounds left, time is critically short.
* **Shift in Power:** Bob's increasingly desperate offers suggest he might be more amenable to a less favorable deal as the deadline approaches.
* **Finality:** Presenting this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and my resolve. While risky, it could push Bob to accept a less than ideal outcome rather than risk getting nothing."
