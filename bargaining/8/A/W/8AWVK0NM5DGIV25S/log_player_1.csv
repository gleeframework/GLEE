I propose to keep the majority of the money, as the first offer is likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it might seem tempting to get some money now, the game is still early, and I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and proposing my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose a slightly lower offer than my first one, but still a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation gets worse for him."
