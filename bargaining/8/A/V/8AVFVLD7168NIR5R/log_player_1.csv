"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60 and leave you with 40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation effects.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. While I initially proposed a 50-50 split, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth less in value due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to hold onto a bit more. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have the scraps. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about accepting such an uneven split, especially since the money is worth significantly less in value now. However, I don't want to risk going to Round 5, where the money will be worth even less.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be reasonable in future negotiations.
