"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can split the money fairly and end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $360,000.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a decent split considering the circumstances. I'll accept Bob's offer.
