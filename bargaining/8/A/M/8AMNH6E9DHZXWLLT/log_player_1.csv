"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small share, but it's a good starting point considering the inflation disadvantage he faces in later rounds.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though Bob's offer is a drastic change from my initial offer, it's still a significant amount of money considering the inflation factor. Accepting now prevents further devaluation of my share in the next round."
