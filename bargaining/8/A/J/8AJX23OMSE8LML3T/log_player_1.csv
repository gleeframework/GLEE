"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money I gain will be worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still trying to maximize my own gain."
