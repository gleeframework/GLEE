"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping to get a quick agreement.  It's a bit risky, but I want to minimize the chance of inflation eating away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, it's still a significant loss compared to my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we both lose money with each round and be more willing to negotiate.  I'll try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a majority share.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in reaching a deal quickly, before inflation erodes our potential gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer again.  Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm still hoping for a more equitable split.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a significant share. The inflation is starting to become a factor, but I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of reaching a deal before it eats away at our potential gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While I recognize the pressure of inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastically reduced share.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, and I'm prepared to see this through to the end if necessary."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but still trying to secure a majority of the money. Inflation is a major concern, but I believe that Bob is also feeling the pressure and will be more open to negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse, and I'm determined to secure a better deal.  The inflation is definitely a factor, but I believe there's still a chance for us to find a more equitable split.  I'm prepared to continue negotiating until we reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're getting close to the end, and inflation is becoming a significant threat. I'm proposing an equal split, recognizing that further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a significantly better outcome for either of us. It's time to compromise and secure something rather than risk losing everything."
