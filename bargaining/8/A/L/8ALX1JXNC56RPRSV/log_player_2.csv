"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Even though I'm losing 36% of the value, Alice is getting the same value as her initial offer. 
* **Fairness:** This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome, especially considering the inflation factor.
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer means going to round 4, where I'll be the one making a proposal. But there's no guarantee Alice will accept it, and further inflation will devalue my gains even more."
