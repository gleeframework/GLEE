"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking for a slightly more even split. How about 60/40 in my favor this time? I believe this is fair considering the inflation that is impacting your share more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
