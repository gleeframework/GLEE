"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I'll take 6,000 and Bob will take 4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think meeting in the middle is a good idea, especially since the money I gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to aim for a more favorable split. I'll pass on this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, where I'll take 5,500 and Bob will take 4,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal given the inflation and the fact that my gains are worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. Bob is now proposing a 45:55 split, which is even more unfavorable to me than the initial 40:60 split. Given the inflation, I think I should be getting a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a better deal""}

I'm proposing a 52:48 split, where I'll take 5,200 and Bob will take 4,800. I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a better deal considering the inflation and the fact that my gains are worth less. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. Bob is now proposing a 40:60 split, which is extremely unfavorable to me. Given the inflation and the fact that my gains are worth significantly less, I think I deserve a much better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up""}

I'm proposing a 48:52 split, where I'll take 4,800 and Bob will take 5,200. I'm willing to give Bob a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that my gains are worth less."
