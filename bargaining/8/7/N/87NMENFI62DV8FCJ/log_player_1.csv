"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm taking a slight advantage given the inflation, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me some gain, and the inflation will only make the money worth less in future rounds."
