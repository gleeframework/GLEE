Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm taking a slightly greedy approach for the first round, hoping to secure a large portion of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept this offer. In the next round, I would be the one making the offer, and the money will be worth even less. 5000 is a fair share considering the inflation."
