Let's see what Alice offers next!  I want a bigger share. ðŸ˜‰"

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's fair, given I'm the one making the offer this time.  Let's see if Alice agrees!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers!  I'll take the 50/50 split.  Let's not lose all the money to inflation."
