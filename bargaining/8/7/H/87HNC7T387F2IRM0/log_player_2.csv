"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}

This way, I'll get a larger share now, but the difference between our shares will decrease as the rounds go on, which might make Alice more likely to accept in the future."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Alice's offer is a bit more attractive now. I'll think about it...
