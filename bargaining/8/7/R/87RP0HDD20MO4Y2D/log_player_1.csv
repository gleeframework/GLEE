**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's time to cut my losses. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  At round 6, the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems intent on pushing his advantage. He's unlikely to agree to anything significantly better than this offer.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While $400,000 is much less than I aimed for initially, it's still a significant amount of money. Rejecting this offer risks walking away with nothing. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the longer the game continues, the worse my position becomes."
