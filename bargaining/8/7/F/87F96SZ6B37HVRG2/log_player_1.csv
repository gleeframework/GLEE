"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving Bob with $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll analyze the offer:

* If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 50% of the original $10,000.
* If I reject the offer, I'll get to make the next proposal, and the money will be worth 90% of its original value (since it's 10% less than the previous round).

Considering the inflation effect, I think it's better to try to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 50-50""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $5,500 and leaving Bob with $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer:

* If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,200, which is worth 52% of the original $10,000.
* If I reject the offer, I'll get to make the next proposal, and the money will be worth 64.1% of its original value (since it's 27.1% less than the previous round).

Considering the inflation effect, I think it's getting harder to get a better deal. I'll accept the offer.
