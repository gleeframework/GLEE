"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm willing to accept a slightly lower amount for myself.
