Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While the inflation has hit Alice hard, she has to accept the offer.  She's losing a lot of value with each passing round, and there's no guarantee that Bob will make a better offer in the next round. Accepting is the more strategic choice."
