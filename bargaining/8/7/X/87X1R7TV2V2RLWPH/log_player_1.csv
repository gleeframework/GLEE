"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not losing any value, but Bob is gaining 20% less than he would have in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
