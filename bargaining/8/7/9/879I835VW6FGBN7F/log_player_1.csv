Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a good share.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still hoping we can reach a fair agreement. Let's try to split the money more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the inflation is working heavily in my favor. While his offer is closer to even, it still heavily favors him, and I'm willing to bet he'll become more desperate as the rounds progress."

Round 5

{

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value is dropping for me, but I'm still hoping for a more even split. Let's try to bridge the gap and both get a decent share before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but he's still being too greedy. I'm holding firm on getting a slightly larger share, knowing that the later rounds will make my offers even more appealing compared to the shrinking pot for Bob."
