"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60/40""}\n\nI'm being generous with my first offer, considering the inflation rates. I'm hoping Bob will see the benefit in accepting this proposal before the money loses more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share because of the higher inflation rate affecting my earnings. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The 60/40 split in Bob's favor is too skewed, considering I'm only losing 5% value per round, while Bob is losing 20%. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I will make a slightly more conservative offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's aggressive offer in the previous round. I'll aim for a 55/45 split, which I believe is more reasonable given the circumstances.\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair compromise.""}"
