Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair deal. However, I need to factor in the inflation that's eating into my share with every passing round. This offer is a bit more in my favor to compensate for that, but still allows you a significant portion.
