This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Even though it's not explicit inflation for Bob, there's an inherent value in getting the money now rather than later. By round 4, Bob is recognizing that a deal made now is better than risking you getting even less agreeable to his terms in future rounds.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While ideally you'd want more to offset the inflation, waiting any longer will continue to reduce your potential gain. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise by meeting your original offer. This suggests he's unlikely to make a significantly better offer in the future."
