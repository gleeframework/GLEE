I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob. Hopefully, he sees the value in accepting it, as the money could be worth less in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,000, I know that if I reject, I'll be the one making the offer in the next round. Inflation hasn't affected my gains yet, so I can still offer a deal that benefits me more and hopefully convince Bob to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $1500, which is slightly less than what he offered me in the previous round. However, since he knows the value of the money he receives is decreasing, he might be willing to accept this offer to avoid further potential losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money Bob is receiving.  This means if I reject and make a counter-offer, the chances of him accepting something more favorable to me are low.  It's better to take $2,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
