Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor this time. Consider that the value of the money decreases faster for you than for me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
