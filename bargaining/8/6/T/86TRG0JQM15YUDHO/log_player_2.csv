{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile for me. How about a 55/45 split?""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, 58% for me, 42% for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, and the impact of inflation is becoming significant. It's worth holding out for a better offer, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with each round. This offer ensures a fair split while acknowledging the effects of inflation. Let's close the deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing, but I still think 56% for me is fair, considering the inflation hits you harder 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation against me, but she's not offering a significant enough concession to justify the losses I'm taking. Holding out for another round is risky, but the potential reward of a better split outweighs accepting this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
