I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor. I believe it's fair and gives Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split this round. Given the inflation and Bob's previous offer, this seems like a fair and even deal."
