"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'd like to propose a division that gives me a decent share while leaving some room for negotiation.

Here's my offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```
This means I'll take $600,000, and Bob will take $400,000."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the fifth round, I'll try to adjust for the increasing inflation and make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my proposal:
```
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

Here's my proposal:
```
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
