Let's see if Bob agrees to this first offer. I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing that I have a slight advantage due to the inflation rate being higher for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

The inflation hurts me more, and this offer is worse than my initial proposal. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly to 5500, hoping to entice Bob into accepting.  I'm still factoring in the inflation rates, but I want to close the deal before the value of the money drops even further."
