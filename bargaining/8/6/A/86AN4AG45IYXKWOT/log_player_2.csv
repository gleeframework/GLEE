"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  I know there's inflation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script.  I'll take 60% this time, but we can work out a more even split later if you like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think 52-48 is a fair split. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I would prefer a more even split,  I'm accepting this offer. With inflation, I'm losing value each round, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even worse deal later on."
