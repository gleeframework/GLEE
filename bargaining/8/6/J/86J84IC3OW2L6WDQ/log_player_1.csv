"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, we can both get a decent amount of money and still have some room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation. Since the offer is still a 55:45 split, I'll think it's a good compromise. Here's my decision:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
