Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point, as the money will depreciate more quickly for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

I'm increasing my share slightly to 5500, as I believe the inflation rate makes this a more fair split. However, I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is worse than my previous proposal, the inflation rate is significantly impacting my potential gains. Accepting this offer will at least guarantee me some money, and the further rounds would likely result in an even lower offer."
