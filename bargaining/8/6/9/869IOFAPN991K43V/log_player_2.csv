Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Time is running out, let's just split it evenly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, knowing Bob's value decreases. However, accepting $43 now is better than risking getting a worse offer in later rounds where the inflation will hurt even more. I'll hold out for one more round to see if she gets closer to 50/50, but if she doesn't budge significantly next round, I'll likely accept."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is a compromise, take it before inflation hurts us both too much.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Time is running out, and with each round, the potential gains for both sides decrease significantly for Bob. 
* **Slight Concession:** Bob is offering a slight concession by going slightly above the 50/50 split, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Warning:** The message highlights the increasing impact of inflation, urging Alice to settle before the deal potentially worsens for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing Bob's potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting a worse offer (or even nothing) in later rounds. Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, and Bob's bargaining power is diminishing rapidly."
