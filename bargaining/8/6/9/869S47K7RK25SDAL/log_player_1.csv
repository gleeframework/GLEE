"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to secure the majority of the money in this first round, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor.  I'm confident Bob will see this as a good deal, considering the money will be worth less to him in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my initial offer, it's still not enough to secure a majority. The money is losing value quickly for both of us, but my position is stronger because I'm losing value at a slower rate. I need to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 600,000 for myself, which is still more than Bob's previous offer. This is a fair compromise given the inflation. I believe Bob will accept this offer as it's better for him than what he proposed, and the money is rapidly losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired split, the inflation is hitting him hard. The offer is still not enough to compensate for the amount of money I'm losing due to inflation.  I need to hold out for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again. The money is losing value at a very high rate now, and I believe Bob will be forced to accept this offer to avoid losing even more. I'm confident this is a fair compromise, considering the current inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's clearly getting desperate.  While I would prefer a larger share, I recognize that the money is rapidly losing value for both of us.  This offer gives me a fair amount, and it's likely the best we can both do in the current circumstances."
