"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll need to adjust my strategy. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
