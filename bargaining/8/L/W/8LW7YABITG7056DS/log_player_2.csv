Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am taking the risk of proposing first. Hopefully, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement!

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. We're both losing money with each round, so I think it's best to find a compromise that's fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50/50 split is fair and we are both losing money with each round.  It's time to compromise."
