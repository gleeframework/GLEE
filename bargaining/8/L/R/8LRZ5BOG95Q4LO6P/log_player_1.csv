  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob's offer is actually a slight increase from his previous offer, but considering the inflation, it's still a bit lower than my previous offer. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer this time. Considering the inflation, Bob's offers have been getting progressively lower, so I'll try to take a bigger share. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
