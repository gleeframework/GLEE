"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in Round 1 was rejected, and now Bob is making a new proposal in Round 2. Considering the 10% decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the 10% decrease in value from Round 2, the money is worth 90% of what it was in Round 1. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700
}
```
I'm offering you $3,700 and keeping $6,300 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob rejected my offer, and now he's proposing a 50-50 split in Round 4. Considering the 27.1% decrease in value from Round 1, the money is worth 72.9% of what it was initially.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer."
