I propose a very small gain for Bob. I want to see if he's greedy or if he's willing to negotiate. It's risky, but I think it's better to start strong and see how he reacts."

Bob's offer is fair, but I'm not going to settle for 50/50 right away.  I want to see if I can push for a better deal.  I'm still confident I can get a larger share of the money."
