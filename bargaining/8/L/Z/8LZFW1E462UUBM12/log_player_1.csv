"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. This offer benefits us both while accounting for future value.""
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Exploiting Time Sensitivity:** Bob's money loses value faster than mine.  He's incentivized to take a decent offer now rather than risk getting a worse one later.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** A 80/20 split might seem initially unfair, but my message aims to frame it as mutually beneficial. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer is strong but leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's willing to risk the devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, it doesn't consider the impact of inflation on Bob's share. He's essentially offering me a worse deal than in the previous round because his $500,000 is now worth less to him. I need to hold out for a better offer that acknowledges the decreasing value of his portion."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money. I'm offering a strong deal again, but it won't get better for you if you wait.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  Bob's potential gains have decreased further due to inflation. 
* **Adjusted Offer:** I've slightly adjusted my offer to make it more appealing while still holding a strong position. 
* **Direct Message:**  I'm emphasizing the time pressure to nudge Bob toward accepting."
