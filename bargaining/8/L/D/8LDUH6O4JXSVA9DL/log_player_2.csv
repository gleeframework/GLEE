**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer. While a 50/50 split would be ideal, time is running out.  We need to signal we're willing to compromise, but not capitulate.  Rejecting this keeps the pressure on Alice and sets us up for a potentially stronger counter-offer."

{""bob_gain"": 49, ""alice_gain"": 51, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.  This is a fair deal that lets us both walk away with something substantial before inflation eats away at it any further. Take it or leave it.""}
