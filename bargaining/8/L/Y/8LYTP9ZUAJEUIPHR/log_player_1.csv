"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```
I'm offering to take 80% of the 100$ and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 70$ is now worth 56$ (since 70 * 0.8 = 56). I'll accept Bob's offer.
