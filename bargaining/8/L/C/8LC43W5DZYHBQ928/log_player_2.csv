"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. This offer ensures a good chunk for you, and a larger share for me before inflation eats away at it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. My turn to be generous, but time is running out and that money is losing value for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is slightly better than her first offer, but it still heavily favors Alice. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice, and we both lose if this fails. This offer is a compromise â€“ a good amount for you, and a bit more for me to offset the shrinking pot. Let's be sensible.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a fair deal, but we both need to agree before your share shrinks any further! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but I need to accept. Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split, and with each round, the value of my potential share diminishes significantly.  Taking $400,000 now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we reach round 12."
