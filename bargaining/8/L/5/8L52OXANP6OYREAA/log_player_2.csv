"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, but I get a little extra for going first. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor, considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm accepting a smaller gain to account for the fact that I went first. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4987.5 
# Alice gain: 5012.5 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it's relatively fair, and considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, it's better to settle now rather than risk further devaluation."
