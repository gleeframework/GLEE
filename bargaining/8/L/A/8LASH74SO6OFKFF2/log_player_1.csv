"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I propose a 990,000/10,000 split. I figure Bob might accept since it's better than nothing, and I get most of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  The money is losing value for Bob, and he seems willing to split it evenly now.  This is a good deal for me."
