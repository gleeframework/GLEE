"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  We can always adjust later.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, 10% is too low, and I know the money will be worth less in future rounds. I'm going to try and get a better deal."
