"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly greedy opening offer, hoping to secure the majority of the money. I'm also taking into account that Bob's money will be worth less in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Bob's money is worth less in each round. It's a decent compromise considering the inflation."
