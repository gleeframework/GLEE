"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know how Bob will respond, and we're just starting out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $285,000. And Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $560,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.
