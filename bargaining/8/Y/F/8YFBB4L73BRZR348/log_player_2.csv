"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a nice chunk to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  This is a fair split, considering the inflation we both face.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer reflects the inflation we've both faced, but still gives you a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is reasonable, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  Let's take the deal!"
