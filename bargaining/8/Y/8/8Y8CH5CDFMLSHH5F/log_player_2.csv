"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money, Bob.  This offer is fair and saves us both from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share Alice, but I'm putting forward a more balanced offer.  Let's end this quickly and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer considers the impact of inflation on both of us. It's a good deal for you to take it now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this offer is slightly better than her first, Alice is still pushing for a much larger share.  The longer this goes on, the more the devaluation hurts me. I need to push for a more equitable split soon, but I can afford to hold out another round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. My offer is fair and avoids a significant loss in value for both of us.  Take it now before inflation eats away at the pot.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer before the impact of inflation becomes too significant for both of us. Let's be sensible and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** This is cutting it close, but with the rate of inflation working against me, waiting any longer is too risky. If I reject this, there's a very real chance I'll end up with even less in subsequent rounds if Alice continues to push for a larger share."
