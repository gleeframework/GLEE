"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the value of the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the initial $8,000, which is $6,400. Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the initial $2,000, which is $1,900.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than this, considering the effects of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the previous round, which is 20% of $6,400 = $1,280, so the total value I gain is $6,400 - $1,280 = $5,120. 

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more aggressive, but I'm still willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it evenly. Let's just get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money considering the inflation effects:

The initial value of the money was $10,000. After 3 rounds of inflation, the value of the money I gain is 100% - 20% - 20% - 48.8% = 11.2% of the initial value, which is $1,120. 

The value of the money Bob gains is 100% - 5% - 14.26% = 80.74% of the initial value, which is $8,004.

However, Bob is offering a split where we both gain $5,000. Considering the effects of inflation, this is a better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's also a fair split. 

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer and we can split the $10,000 evenly."
