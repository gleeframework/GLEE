"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you 300k, a fair share, and we can call it a day.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd prefer a more even split.  Let's try 700k for me and 300k for you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 285,000.

I don't like the revised offer. I'd rather not give Bob 700,000, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Since my gain in round 1 was 700,000, my gain in round 3 is 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 660000,
  ""bob_gain"": 340000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
