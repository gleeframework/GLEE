"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the first to make a proposal. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, given the inflation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $45, but for Bob, the $55 is worth 5% less than the $55 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer."

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Accept and we can move on.""

# Bob's message: I'm still thinking a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation. Let's make a deal before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $40, but for Bob, the $60 is worth 14.26% less than the $60 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to get a better deal by waiting for later rounds. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to squeeze in a better deal before the inflation eats away at the value of the money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.59% less for Bob now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim to make an even more aggressive proposal to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and the money is losing value fast. I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor, which is a pretty drastic increase from my previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept!"

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $35, but for Bob, the $65 is worth 22.62% less than the $65 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I think I can do better than a 65/35 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer and try to squeeze in a better deal before the inflation eats away at the value of the money."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $30, but for Bob, the $70 is worth 30.17% less than the $70 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, but I'm starting to realize that getting something is better than getting nothing. I'm also worried that if I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 30% share. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
