"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, with Alice getting a slightly larger share. I want to start with a proposal that's likely to be accepted but also sets the precedent for me to get a better share in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a clear attempt by Bob to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly. Bob's offer in the previous round was unfair, and I want to show that I won't be taken advantage of. I believe this offer is still reasonable given the inflation and sets me up for a better position in the future rounds."
