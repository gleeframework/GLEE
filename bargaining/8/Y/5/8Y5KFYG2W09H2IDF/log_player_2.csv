While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth risking a round to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  The inflation rate favors me more, so there's a chance I can secure a more advantageous split later."

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but it's still more favorable for me than Alice. I'll see if I can secure a more even split in the next round."

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

``` 

Even though Alice is starting to get more aggressive with her offers, the inflation is still working in my favor. I'm going to hold out for a better split. The pressure is on for Alice to make a deal, but I'm willing to gamble."
