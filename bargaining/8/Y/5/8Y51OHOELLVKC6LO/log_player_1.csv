```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40

}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round!"

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's offer is closer to my target, I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
