"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'm actually getting 4800 in ""real"" value, and Bob is getting 5000 in ""real"" value. This offer is a 49.5% split, which is closer to 50/50 than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
