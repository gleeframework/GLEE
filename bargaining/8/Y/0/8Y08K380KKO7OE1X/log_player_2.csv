"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking the larger share.  This gives you a chance to get something, and we can negotiate further if you're not happy with it.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still looking for a more favorable split. I'm offering 70/30, which is still closer to my initial proposal. Let's find a middle ground before we lose even more money. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of getting a significantly smaller share. The pressure from inflation is increasing, but it's not at a critical level yet. I'll push for a more balanced split in the next round."
