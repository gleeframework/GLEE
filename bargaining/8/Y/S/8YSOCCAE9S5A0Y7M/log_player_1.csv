"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too one-sided, Alice.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor this time.  Consider that the money will be worth less for both of us if we wait any longer, especially for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
