**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal, but I also need to be mindful that time is running out.  We're past the halfway point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on. Making a ""final offer"" emphasizes the urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly to show some willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a slight advantage. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice will reject this, but it's a calculated one.  If she's also feeling the pressure, she might be more inclined to accept a less favorable deal now than risk getting nothing later."
