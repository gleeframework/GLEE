"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a friendly message to set a positive tone. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly while still getting a decent share. By framing it as a ""fair"" split, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and increase the chances of him accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn!  How about this slightly adjusted split? It's important we settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get from the 45 dollars is less than it appears. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me with each round, the effective value I'd receive from Bob's offer is 45 * 0.9 = 40.5 dollars. This is significantly less than what I initially offered to Bob, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Additionally, Bob's message emphasizes settling quickly, which might indicate he's open to further negotiation to avoid losing the deal entirely. I'll try to leverage this in the next round to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances, let's meet halfway between our offers.""}\n\nI'm now offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message that suggests meeting halfway between our previous offers. Given the inflation, the actual value of the money I receive decreases with each round, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable. By referencing our previous offers, I'm attempting to create a sense of compromise and reasonableness, which might encourage Bob to accept this proposal and end the game before the value of the money drops further for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money I receive, the effective value of the 48 dollars is approximately 48 * 0.729 = 35.0 dollars. Although this is less than what I initially hoped for, Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, implying that further negotiation might not be fruitful. Considering the decreasing value of the money with each round and the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action to ensure I receive some value from the game.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
