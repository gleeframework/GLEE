"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap things up quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob thinks it's a fair split, but I'm not so sure!

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3. I'd like to make a counteroffer that gives me a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you a bit more, but not too much.""
}
```

This offer gives me $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm hoping this will be more to Bob's liking!"
