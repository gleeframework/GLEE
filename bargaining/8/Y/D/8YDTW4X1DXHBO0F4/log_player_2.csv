Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous by offering you this much. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one, but I'll have to accept. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** My share is losing value extremely fast due to inflation. Waiting any longer means getting even less.
* **Uncertain Future:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. She might even offer less, putting me in a worse position. 

While 300,000 is significantly less than what I could have gotten initially, it's better to secure something now than risk ending up with even less later.
