"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation scenario, and it's often in your best interest to start with a strong initial offer. I'm aiming for a significant share, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob deserves something. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still far from fair considering my initial proposal.  He's taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my share a bit, acknowledging the inflation, but still holding a strong majority.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's aggressive offer in the previous round.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It seems like we're both getting more reasonable with each round.  While my share is considerably less than my initial goal, it's still a significant sum, and the inflation is becoming increasingly severe.  I'm taking the 50/50 split, and hoping that Bob will agree to something more favorable in the future if we continue to play."
