Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. How about we split it 55/45 this time, with me taking the slightly larger share? It's still a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
