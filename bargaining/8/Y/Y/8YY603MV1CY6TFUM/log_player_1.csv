"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is a fair offer. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to the middle this time, with a slight advantage for me, since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think Bob's offer is still not fair, considering I offered him 40% in the first round and now he's offering me 45%. I'll reject and make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob a bit more than my initial offer, but less than his previous offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Let's see if he accepts!"
