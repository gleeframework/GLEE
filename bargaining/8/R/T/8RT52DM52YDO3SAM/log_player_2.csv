"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, the inflation rate means Alice is losing money much faster than I am. I can afford to wait and see if she'll make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is necessary given the inflation rates. I'm willing to compromise, but this proposal reflects the higher impact inflation has on you."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I understand your position, but this offer is a compromise that considers the long-term impact of inflation on both of us.  
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation rates.  It's better than waiting and potentially losing more due to the increasing inflation."
