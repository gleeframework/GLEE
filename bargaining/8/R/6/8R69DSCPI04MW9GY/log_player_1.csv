"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60 is too much for you. How about we do 55 for me and 45 for you? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
