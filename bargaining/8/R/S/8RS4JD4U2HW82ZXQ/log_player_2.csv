"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to split the money fairly, but I'm willing to give you a bit more to start.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I think we should split the money fairly considering the inflation, and I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in the next rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I think it's the most fair way to divide the money, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is losing value due to inflation, accepting the 50/50 split now is better than risking further loss in the next rounds."
