Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think 30% is too little for me, considering the original amount was $1,000,000. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
