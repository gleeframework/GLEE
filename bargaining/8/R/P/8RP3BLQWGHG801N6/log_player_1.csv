I propose to take 5,500$ and give 4,500$ to Bob. This way, I get a slightly bigger share, but it is still fair, and I believe Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest way to divide the money, and I believe it will be accepted."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I recognize that inflation is making the money worth less, I am not willing to accept such a lopsided split. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I propose a 4500/5500 split.  I've lowered my share slightly to acknowledge the impact of inflation, but I still believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that Bob should accept."
