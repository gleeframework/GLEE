Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, how about a compromise? 55/45.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to a 65/35 split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share since the money is losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, accepting a 35/65 split at this stage would set a bad precedent. Bob knows the pressure is on me due to inflation, but I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm hoping he starts to get concerned about getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  52/48 is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm upping my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but also drawing a line in the sand.  The message is firm to try and convey that I'm serious about walking away if he doesn't accept.  The clock is ticking, and even though this isn't ideal, getting a little less than I want is better than getting nothing."
