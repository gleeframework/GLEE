"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation impacts you more, but my offer is also fair. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I've increased my offer again, acknowledging the time pressure. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
Explanation: While Bob is right about the time pressure, his offer is still not good enough considering the rapid inflation for me. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than last round acknowledging the time pressure. Take it or leave it. This is my final offer."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  I need to apply more pressure to get Bob to agree.
* **Slight concession:** By slightly increasing my offer from Round 3, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise, but only marginally.
* **Ultimatum:**  The ""take it or leave it"" and ""final offer"" statements create a sense of urgency and hopefully push Bob to accept before we both lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to settle this. I'm sticking to my previous offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant devaluation:** The inflation is eating into the potential gains rapidly. Waiting any longer is too risky, even if Bob's offer isn't ideal.
* **Downward trend:**  Bob has shown he's not budging much.  He's sticking to his previous offer, and there's no guarantee he'll increase it later.
* **Something is better than nothing:** Getting $5200, even after inflation, is far better than walking away with nothing if we run out of rounds."
