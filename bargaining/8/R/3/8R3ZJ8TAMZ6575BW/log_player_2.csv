**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, indicating she's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. While she claims this is her final offer, that's a tactic often used in negotiations.  I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we need to settle this. I'm sticking to my previous offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm calling Alice's bluff. I don't believe she'll risk letting the money shrink even further, especially after claiming her last offer was final. By holding firm, I'm hoping she'll concede and accept a slightly less favorable deal to avoid losing out entirely."
