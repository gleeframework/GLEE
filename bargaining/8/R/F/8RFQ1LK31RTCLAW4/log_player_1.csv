"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1.  I figure it's better to be safe than sorry.  Since it's the first round, I don't know how much the inflation is hurting Bob.  I want to maximize my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd still prefer to take more, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round.  With inflation, the value of the money I'd get in future rounds is uncertain. It's safer to take the guaranteed 500,000 now."
