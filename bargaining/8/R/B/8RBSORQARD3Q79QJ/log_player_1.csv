"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

In this round, I'd be getting $5000, which is worth 90% of the original $8000 I would have gotten in Round 1. So, I'm actually getting 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 in ""inflation-adjusted"" dollars.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering I could have gotten $8000 in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. In this round, $10,000 is worth 90% of the previous round's $10,000, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need to protect my interests""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! In this round, the $10,000 is worth 72.9% of the original $10,000, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this round, I'd be getting $4000, which is worth 72.9% of the original $8000 I would have gotten in Round 1. So, I'm actually getting 4000 / 0.729 = 5490.55 in ""inflation-adjusted"" dollars.

Considering the offer, I'd be getting a smaller share than I would have gotten in Round 1, and the 60/40 split is quite favorable to Bob. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. In this round, $10,000 is worth 64.9% of the original $10,000, so I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger risk, but I need to protect my interests""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I think this is a fair split.  It's better than getting nothing in the end! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! In this round, the $10,000 is worth 59.05% of the original $10,000, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this round, I'd be getting $3000, which is worth 59.05% of the original $8000 I would have gotten in Round 1. So, I'm actually getting 3000 / 0.5905 = 5077.55 in ""inflation-adjusted"" dollars.

Considering the offer, I'd be getting a very small share, and Bob is getting a larger share than in previous rounds. I'm not sure if this is the best option, but I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
