Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's better to secure a good sum now than risk losing more with inflation.

# Alice gain: 60

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  My turn, and I'm proposing we split the difference of your offer last round.  It's more important to settle this quickly than to haggle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
