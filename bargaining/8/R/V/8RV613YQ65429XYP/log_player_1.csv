"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable proposal!""}

I'm offering Bob 300,000 and keeping 700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. If I accept, I'll get 500,000, which is worth 80% of the original 700,000 I would have gotten in the first round. But if I reject, I might get a better deal in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again!""}

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm willing to give you less 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth a lot less now! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer. However, I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

After some thought, I've decided to {""decision"": ""accept""} and take the 400,000. It's not a great deal, but it's better than the 0 I'd get if I rejected and the game continued."
