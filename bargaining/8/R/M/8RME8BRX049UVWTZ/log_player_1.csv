"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI have offered Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. This is a reasonable offer, considering that the money loses value for Bob with each passing round. I hope he accepts it.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts the offer or proceeds to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, he will be more inclined to accept a lower offer in the future. I will try to take advantage of this situation to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the next round. I will make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting""}\n\nI have increased my initial offer by $50,000, but I believe this is still a reasonable offer, considering that the money is losing value for Bob with each passing round. I hope he accepts this offer before the money loses even more value for him.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts the offer or proceeds to the next round."
