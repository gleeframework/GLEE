Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a more even split, considering the upcoming inflation will hit you harder. Let's reach an agreement quickly before things get too complicated. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation. I need to reject and propose something better.
