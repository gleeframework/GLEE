"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it evenly, but I'll need a bit more to compensate for the inflation you're experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a more ""even"" split in this round, it's crucial to remember that the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Accepting $300,000 now is a terrible deal compared to what I could potentially secure if I hold out a bit longer."

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this offer is more than fair considering the time constraint and the inflation working against me.  Let's settle this now.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical.  I'm willing to take less to avoid further losses due to inflation. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, but her offer still significantly favors her.  While I am losing money due to the time pressure, accepting $400,000 now would be a considerable loss compared to my initial goal. I need to push for a more equitable split while there's still time."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer.  It's a reasonable compromise that accounts for the time pressure and lets us both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. This offer is fair and allows us both to get a decent amount before the time runs out. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is running critically low. While Alice is still getting a better share, accepting her offer secures me $450,000. Rejecting it means risking getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing, in the few remaining rounds. 

It's important to remember that the value of the money is rapidly declining for me, and it's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk losing everything in a gamble for a slightly better outcome."
