Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic bargaining game. Since I'm playing as Alice, I'm aiming for the majority of the money.  I'm offering Bob a small share hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is now trying to take the lion's share. It's not a good deal for me, even with inflation. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still aiming for a majority. With inflation, the value of the money is dropping, and I need to find a balance between getting a fair deal for myself and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away with everything."
