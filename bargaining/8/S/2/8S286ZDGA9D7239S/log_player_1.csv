"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. My message to Bob is a straightforward one: I'm willing to give him 400,000$ and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 300,000$ is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round, which is 0.9 * 600,000 = 540,000$. Similarly, Bob's gain of 700,000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, which is 0.95 * 400,000 = 380,000$.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a larger share. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000$ and keeping 420,000$ for myself. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to give him a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 400,000$ is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.729 * 600,000 = 437,400$. Similarly, Bob's gain of 600,000$ is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.8574 * 400,000 = 342,960$.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the money continuing to lose value."
