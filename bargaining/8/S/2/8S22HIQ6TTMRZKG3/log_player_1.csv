"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 60-40 in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating with you! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 3000 / 0.9 = 3333.33
* Bob's gain: 7000 / 0.9 = 7777.78

I'm not happy with this offer. I think I deserve a better share. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in my favor, which I think is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small chance at a good deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 2000 / 0.727 = 2756.22
* Bob's gain: 8000 / 0.727 = 1102.77

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm getting desperate. I'll accept it.
