Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 60/40, but I'm not giving you 70% of the money. It's only fair that we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's clear we're not going to agree on a heavily unbalanced split.  This is the fairest offer, given the declining value of the money for me with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I could try for a slightly better deal in the next round, Bob is right that the declining value of the money for him makes it less likely he'll agree to a heavily unbalanced split. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a good outcome for me."
