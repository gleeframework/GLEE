Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money almost evenly, Bob, but slightly in my favor considering the inflation we face. This way we both benefit greatly from finishing the game right away.

# Alice gain: 525000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm not sure why you think this inflation is a good reason to take more money. Let's split the money more fairly this time, considering your advantage with the inflation. If you accept, we can both take home a decent amount.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real.  I lose value every round we play.  You haven't acknowledged that, and your offers haven't been fair. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
