Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than an even split. I'm willing to give you a bit more to start, but I'll need a larger share in the end. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to give up too much in the end. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
