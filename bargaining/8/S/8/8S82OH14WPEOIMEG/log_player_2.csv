# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down slightly, time is working against me. It's still more beneficial to hold out for a better offer, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. I'll take a bit more, and you can still walk away with something 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.  While this offer isn't ideal, accepting guarantees I get something rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. Alice knows the pressure is on me, and it's unlikely she'll offer anything better at this stage."
