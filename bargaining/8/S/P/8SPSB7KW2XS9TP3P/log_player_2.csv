"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the initial split seems unfair, Alice is affected by inflation much more than Bob. It's highly likely that in subsequent rounds, Alice will be forced to offer a larger share to Bob due to the decreasing value of the money for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this is more equitable considering the inflation.  Let's settle this quickly.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Advantage of Inflation:** Alice's money is losing value quickly.  By Round 2, her $6000 offer is worth considerably less to her.
* **Stronger Position:** Bob is now in a stronger negotiating position. This offer reflects that shift in power. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes that a quick resolution is in both parties' best interests due to the rapidly depreciating value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the heat of the inflation but is still overvaluing her position.  While her offer has improved, it's still skewed in her favor considering the money is losing value for her much faster than for Bob. There's room for her to offer a more significant share in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round costs us both. This offer secures you a decent amount, but it needs to be now.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** By round 4, the impact of inflation is significant. Alice's offers, while slowly improving, show she's still not fully grasping the urgency of the situation.
* **Assertive but Fair:** This offer reflects the changing power dynamic. It's a strong move from Bob, but the message emphasizes that it's in both their best interests to settle before the money loses even more value. 
* **Time Factor:**  The message explicitly highlights the time constraint. Delaying further only hurts both players."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know time is of the essence, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my compromise, considering the current inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally understanding the impact of the inflation, but her compromise is still too small. She's offering Bob only $200 more than her previous offer, which is a tiny concession considering how much value she's losing with each passing round. Bob needs to hold firm and wait for a more realistic offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a lifeline.  This is the last round where you can secure a significant amount. Don't let greed cloud your judgment; accept this offer before it's too late.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Ultimatum:**  Six rounds in, the situation is dire for Alice. This offer is a clear signal that this is Bob's final concession.
* **Playing on Emotions:** The message uses strong language (""lifeline,"" ""greed,"" ""too late"") to try and push Alice towards a decision.  The rapidly decreasing pot adds weight to these words.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slight):** While presented as an ultimatum, Bob has actually reduced his demand slightly (from $7500 to $7000). This might be enough to sway Alice without significantly impacting Bob's potential gain."
