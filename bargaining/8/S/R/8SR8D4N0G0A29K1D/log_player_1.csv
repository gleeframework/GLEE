"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but still leave something for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 50% of the money just yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the money's value again. Time to think strategically...

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, I'll get a decent chunk of the money, but you'll still get a third of it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the reduced amount. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference from the last offer.  I'm willing to take slightly less, but we need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money's value has dropped significantly.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer. $600,000 is a decent amount, considering the reduced value of the money. It's better than risking going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. Let's finalize the deal!"
