"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Game:** This is a classic game theory scenario with a twist.  The key element is the 5% inflation impacting Alice's potential gains each round. This means Alice needs to secure a good deal quickly, or her potential reward diminishes.
* **Round 1 Importance:**  Setting the tone for the negotiation is crucial in the first round.  Alice needs to strike a balance between being fair and understanding the urgency created by inflation.
* **The Offer:** A 52.5% / 47.5% split in Alice's favor is a strong opening move. It gives her a slight advantage but is still reasonable enough that Bob might consider accepting, especially knowing the inflation factor is working against Alice.
* **The Message:**  Keeping the message simple and emphasizing fairness can encourage Bob to accept. A more aggressive opening could push him to gamble on a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Factor:** The 5% inflation has already kicked in, making Bob's offer significantly worse for Alice than her own Round 1 offer. Accepting now would mean losing a substantial amount of potential gain.
* **Power Shift:**  Bob's message suggests he senses an advantage due to the inflation pressure on Alice. Accepting his offer now would confirm his belief and likely lead to worse offers in subsequent rounds if he's wrong.
* **Calculated Risk:** While rejecting does mean risking further inflation, Alice's position is still relatively strong. She needs to show Bob she's not desperate and is willing to negotiate for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Two rounds have passed, meaning Alice's potential gains have already been reduced by 10% total (5% each round). The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for her.
* **Strong Stance:**  By presenting a 50/50 split as a ""final offer,"" Alice shows she is serious and unwilling to accept less than an equal share. 
* **Psychology:** Framing the offer as the ""fairest outcome"" appeals to Bob's sense of justice. Even though he holds an advantage due to inflation, accepting a less fair offer might weigh on him.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy involves a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, Alice will be in a very weak negotiating position in Round 4, as her potential gains will be further reduced.
* It's possible Bob is highly risk-averse and might have accepted a slightly uneven split in his favor in a previous round. However, his aggressive stance in Round 2 suggests he's likely aiming for a significant advantage."
