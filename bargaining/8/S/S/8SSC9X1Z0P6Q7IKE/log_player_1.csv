"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n###  I will accept Bob's offer in Round 4 because, considering the inflation, the value of money is decreasing with each passing round. At this point, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. Given that Bob has stated this is his final offer and the decreasing value of the money, it seems prudent to accept the offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The difference in our gains (52 for Bob and 48 for me) is relatively small, and the risk of losing more value to inflation outweighs the potential for a slightly better offer in the future rounds.\n\n###\n\n###"
