"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of 30 is now worth less than 30 in the first round. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation, my offer from the first round (60) is now worth even less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With my gain of 50 in the first round now being worth only 36.9% of its original value, I'm getting desperate. However, I still think I can do better than 20. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the severe inflation. My gain from the first round is now worth only 27.1% of its original value, so I'll aim for a higher percentage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
