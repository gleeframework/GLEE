"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm a generous Alice""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm open to a more even split in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to consider his proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less this round, I'll have to think carefully about the value of the offer.
