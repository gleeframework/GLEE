Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly less favorable deal, hoping she'll accept to avoid further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a better deal, even though the inflation is hurting. Let's see if I can get Alice to budge."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. Inflation is getting more serious, and I think this is the fairest option given the circumstances."
