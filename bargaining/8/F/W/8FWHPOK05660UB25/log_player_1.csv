"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  That's more fair, since my money is worth less with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the uneven split. I'd rather not give up 20% of the remaining value of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to keep up with the inflation!""
}
```"
