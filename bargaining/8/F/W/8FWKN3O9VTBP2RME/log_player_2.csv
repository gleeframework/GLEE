Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Time is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, but 60/40 is too uneven. I'm willing to give up a little more from my initial offer, but I need to see some compromise on your end. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to hold onto a significantly larger share. While the inflation is hitting me harder, it's also eroding her potential gains. I need to hold firm and push for a more equitable split."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  45/55 is a compromise, reflecting the time pressure and inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but the split needs to be fairer than your previous proposals.""}"
