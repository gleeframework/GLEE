"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. I want to start with a strong offer, hoping to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation means that accepting Bob's offer is the best option for me. In the next round, I would only receive 9.5% of the money due to inflation, so accepting 10% now is a better deal."
