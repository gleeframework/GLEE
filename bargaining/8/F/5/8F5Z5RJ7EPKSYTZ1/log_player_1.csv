"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was tempting Alice, but the inflation makes it a bad deal for me in the long run. Let's be realistic, how about a 55/45 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
