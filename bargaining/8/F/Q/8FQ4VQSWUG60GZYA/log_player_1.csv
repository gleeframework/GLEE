# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation! Given the new numbers, I'm not thrilled about the 20% less value for my share, but I'll consider the offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to give you such a large majority of the remaining funds. I'm hoping for a better deal.""
