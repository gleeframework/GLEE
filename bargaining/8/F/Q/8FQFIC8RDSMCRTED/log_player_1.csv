"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I want to see if Bob is willing to settle for a small share right away, or if he wants to play it out and see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my last one, and I'm sure I can do better if I get to make the next proposal. I'm taking my chances and rejecting this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time, but still keeping a majority share for myself. Since we're both aware of the inflation, I'm hoping Bob will realize it's in his best interest to take this offer before it gets even less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less now, a 50/50 split is fair and  better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round. It's time to end this game."
