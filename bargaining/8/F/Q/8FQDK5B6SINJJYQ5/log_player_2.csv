Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the inflation pinch. I'm offering you $35, which is worth more than what you would have gotten last round. Let's settle this now before things get worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
