Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  I'm taking a slight cut from your offer, but the next round we'll both get less because of inflation. Let's try to find a more agreeable split. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51
