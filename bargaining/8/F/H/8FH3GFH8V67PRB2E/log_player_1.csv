"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair and straightforward proposal to split the money evenly.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is offering a substantial amount, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a significantly smaller share than the initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to compensate for the inflation, but I'm still offering a fair deal.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled about the offer, the inflation has already eaten away a significant portion of the potential gains.  I'll accept this offer, as it's likely the best I can get at this point."
