"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  It's true that an even split seems fair at first, but the inflation factor means I'll lose value on my share with each passing round.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation factor.  We both get a good chunk of the money, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you have a better proposal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the funds. Considering the inflation, it seems fair for both of us to receive the same amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is more favorable now.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. While I would prefer a 60/40 split, it's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing at all."
