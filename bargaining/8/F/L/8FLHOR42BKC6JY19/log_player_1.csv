"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm generous.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets the remaining 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 90% of the original 90% I proposed in the first round, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original amount, or 810,000.

Bob's offer is to meet halfway, which is 50% of the original $1,000,000, or 500,000 for me and 500,000 for Bob.

Since Bob's offer is better than mine in the first round, and it's also better than my current offer after inflation, I'll accept his offer.
