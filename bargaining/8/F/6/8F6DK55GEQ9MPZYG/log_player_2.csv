"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I expect a fair return in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is offering a very lopsided split. While I appreciate the ""generosity,""  it's not sustainable for the long term.  I'll try to negotiate a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share to make this worthwhile for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  Accepting this offer means a decent gain for me, and it seems Alice is also willing to compromise.  It's a good starting point for a more equitable outcome in the future."
