Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the offers are getting closer to something more reasonable, I need to hold out for a better deal in the hopes that she starts feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot."

This is a tough one, but the inflation is really starting to bite.  Alice is very likely to keep pushing for a better deal for herself, knowing that time is on her side. It's a gamble, but taking 44 now is better than risking getting even less (or nothing) in later rounds."
