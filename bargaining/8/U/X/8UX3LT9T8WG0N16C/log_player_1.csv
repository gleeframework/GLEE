"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 55/45 split is a bit too generous for me. I'd rather aim for a more even split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 81% of its original value due to inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping it's more acceptable to Bob."
