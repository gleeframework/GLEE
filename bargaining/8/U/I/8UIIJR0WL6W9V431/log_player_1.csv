"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. It's a good starting point to see how he reacts to the initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unfair considering the inflation. Even though he's offering me a small amount, it's much less than what I was initially aiming for. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but it's still a significant amount. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of losing too much.  It's also a better deal for me than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still unfair considering the inflation. Even though I'm getting a slightly larger share than before, it's much less than what I was initially aiming for and I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, acknowledging the inflation, but maintaining a substantial portion of the money. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still striving for a decent outcome."
