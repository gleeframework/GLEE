"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures fairness for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a bit too generous for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. The 50-50 split is a good idea, but I'd like to see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing with each round!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob. I'll take a bit more.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly larger share, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise."
