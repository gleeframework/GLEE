"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually worth 38.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, and I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45 is a fairer share for me. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I deserve a bit more since the money is worth less now. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 42 is worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's actually worth 35.85.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, and I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think 48 is a fair share for me. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 38, but I think I deserve more since the money is worth less now and I'm getting closer to the minimum. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 38 is worth 77.38% of its original value, so it's actually worth 29.35.

I'm not getting any younger, and the money is getting worth less by the minute. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
