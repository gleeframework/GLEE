"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob!

I'll think for a moment... Ah, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split just yet. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a toll, and my share is worth 20% less than in the previous round!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'll take a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still leaning towards a slightly larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are biting! My share is worth significantly less than in the first round.

I'll think for a moment... Ah, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to another round. The 52-48 split is acceptable to me."
