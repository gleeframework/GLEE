"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original 100$, which is $60, and Bob will take the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm framing it as a fair start to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to reconsider, but I'm not going to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob, it seems.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, $30 is equivalent to $33 in the first round. Still, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm trying to increase my share to 45% of the original $100, which is $45, while still leaving 55% for Bob, which is $55. I'm framing it as a compromise to account for the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think this is the best we can do! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on me now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now, $50 is equivalent to $68.45 in the first round. This is a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I should take it.

However, I'm also considering the fact that the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, which means he's getting an even smaller share than I am. I'm not sure if he's being completely honest about his willingness to meet me halfway.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
