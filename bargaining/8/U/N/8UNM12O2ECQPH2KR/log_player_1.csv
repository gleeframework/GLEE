"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer sounds like a ""compromise"", it's heavily skewed in his favor.  The inflation is hurting him far more than me. By rejecting this offer, I put pressure on him to offer something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** By framing this as my ""final offer"", I increase the pressure on Bob. He knows that if he rejects this, his options will only get worse in the next round due to the accelerating inflation hitting his potential gains.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my share slightly from my initial offer to make it seem like I'm compromising, even though it's still heavily in my favor. 
* **Inflation Advantage:** I'm leveraging the fact that inflation affects Bob much more severely. Each round that passes gives me a stronger negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but it's time to cut my losses. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While this offer isn't ideal, the inflation is starting to eat into my potential gains as well.  Waiting another round might not result in a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob's offer, and his message, indicate increasing desperation. He's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation. However, there's no guarantee he'll completely cave and offer a much larger share in the next round.
* **""Bird in the Hand"" Principle:** It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less if Bob becomes increasingly irrational due to the rapid devaluation of his potential gains."
