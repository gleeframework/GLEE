Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept that offer!  1000 dollars is far too little for me. I'll propose a more fair split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and ensures we both get a good amount."
