"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more since I'm taking the risk of this round.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
