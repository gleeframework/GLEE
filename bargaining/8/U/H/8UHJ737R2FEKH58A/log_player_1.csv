"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain would be 50% of the new total value of $100, which is $100 * 0.8 = $80. However, I'll get only 50% of that, which is $40.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
