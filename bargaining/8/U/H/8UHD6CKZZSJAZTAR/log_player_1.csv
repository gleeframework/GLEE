"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for being the better negotiator 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's a better negotiator, huh?

I'll think about it... With inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is 3800. Considering Bob's gain is worth 80% of the original amount, which is 8000, I think I'm getting a relatively good deal. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
