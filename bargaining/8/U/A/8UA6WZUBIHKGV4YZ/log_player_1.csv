"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and I'm giving Bob a decent chunk of change. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $3600. This is a significant decrease in value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. I think a 60/40 split is a bit too skewed in his favor, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations and the continued erosion of my potential gain due to inflation.
