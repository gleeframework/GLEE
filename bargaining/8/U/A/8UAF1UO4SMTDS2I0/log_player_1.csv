"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept it right away or if he wants to gamble on getting a better deal in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very aggressive, but I'm not going to accept this offer just yet. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation is a factor, but I think I can still get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to decrease my offer by 1000, but keep the majority share for myself. I think this still leaves a reasonable amount for Bob, and the inflation is pushing him to take a deal rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, but I'm not going to give in yet. The inflation is definitely biting, but I think I can still get a better deal if I keep holding out. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced offer this round.  With the inflation hitting us both, I think a 60/40 split is a more reasonable compromise. I'm still aiming for a majority, but acknowledging that Bob needs to see some value in continuing this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still not convinced.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I think I can still get a better outcome if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  The inflation is making the deal less attractive with each round, and I think a fair split is the only way we're going to reach an agreement. It's a big concession on my part, but I think it's the best way to ensure that we both get something at this point."
