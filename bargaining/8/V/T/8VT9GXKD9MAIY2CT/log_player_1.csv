"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that we both have equal power in this game. Let's see how it goes! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'm not as attached to the original 60-40 split.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'm keeping in mind that I might try to negotiate further in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
