"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try 60-40. It's still a fair split, and I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
