"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving Bob with 40%, or $40. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I get to propose this round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that he gets to propose this round!

I'll reject his offer since it's still not in my favor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a 60/40 split, but I'm not budging. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the original $100, which is $55, and leaving Bob with 45%, or $45. My message is a counteroffer, suggesting we meet in the middle."
