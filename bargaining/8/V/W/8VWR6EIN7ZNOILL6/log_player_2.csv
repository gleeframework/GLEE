"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob and I'm not going to accept being given only $1!  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5} 
``` 
I propose a fair split, 95 dollars for me and 5 dollars for Alice. Since the money decreases in value for me every round, this offer ensures we both get something, and I get most of the value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much better than the $1 she offered in the first round.  While I'd prefer more, with inflation kicking in, it's better to take what I can get."
