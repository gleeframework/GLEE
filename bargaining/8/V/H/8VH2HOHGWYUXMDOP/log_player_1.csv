"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 90 dollars and leaving Bob with 10 dollars. This is a pretty standard first offer â€“ I'm aiming to get a good chunk of the money, but I'm not being completely unreasonable.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and I'd rather get 50 dollars now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds due to inflation."
