Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it evenly this time. We can both get a fair share before inflation takes a bigger bite. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
