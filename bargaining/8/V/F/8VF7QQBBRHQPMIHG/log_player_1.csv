"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 30 is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70$ is actually worth 63$ (since it's 10% less than the original 80%). Bob's gain of 30$ is worth 28.50$ (since it's 5% less than the original 30.5$).

Considering the offer, I'm not sure I want to accept it. I was hoping for a better deal, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need a bigger piece to account for the inflation.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing that I get 85% of the remaining money, which is worth 85$ (after inflation), and Bob gets 15%, which is worth 7.50$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 25 is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 75$ is worth 55.50$ (since it's 27.1% less than the original 80$).
Bob's gain of 25$ is worth 21.41$ (since it's 14.26% less than the original 30$).

Considering the offer, I'm not sure I want to accept it. I was hoping for a better deal, especially since the money is worth even less due to further inflation. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for an even higher percentage of the remaining money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, I need a bigger share to account for the severe inflation.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing that I get 90% of the remaining money, which is worth 45$ (after inflation), and Bob gets 10%, which is worth 4.50$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll give you a slightly better deal to avoid going to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 82 
# Bob gain: 18 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 82$ is worth 48.52$ (since it's 40.95% less than the original 80$).
Bob's gain of 18$ is worth 13.86$ (since it's 22.62% less than the original 30$).

Considering the offer, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. However, I think this is as good as it's going to get, so I'll accept the offer.
