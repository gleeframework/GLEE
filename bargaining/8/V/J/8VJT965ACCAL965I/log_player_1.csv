"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to share a bit more fairly, but I think we can both do better. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, accepting the offer would give Alice $45, but due to inflation, the value of the money has decreased by 20%, making it less desirable. Rejecting the offer allows Alice to proceed to the next round, where she can make a counteroffer that may be more beneficial to her. Additionally, the decrease in value due to inflation may put pressure on Bob to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 55,""bob_gain"": 45,""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think we should compromise. This way, we both get a decent share.""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice takes into account the impact of inflation on the value of the money and proposes a compromise that gives her a slightly larger share, while still being relatively fair to Bob. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the need to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
