"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the low offer, save us both from inflation! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
