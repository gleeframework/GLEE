"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is just a friendly way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  50/50 is the best way to ensure we both get a good share before inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $500,000
* Bob's gain: $500,000

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer. I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since we're getting closer to the deadline.
