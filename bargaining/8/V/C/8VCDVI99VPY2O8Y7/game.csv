900000.0,100000.0,I propose a 90/10 split. I think it's fair considering the inflation impacts us differently.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'll give you a small amount, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation impact on me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, which is still a better deal for me after the inflation hit.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,I'm not willing to give up that much more. I think 60/40 is too skewed towards you after the inflation.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
400000.0,600000.0,I'm adjusting my offer. 40/60 split seems fair considering the current inflation impact. This is my final offer.,Alice,5,
