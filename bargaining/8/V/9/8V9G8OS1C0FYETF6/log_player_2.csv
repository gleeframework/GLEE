Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate... 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go on and the value of her potential winnings decreases. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm betting I can push for a slightly better outcome in the next round or two."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for 50/50 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's risky to push further. Alice is offering a 50/50 split, and while it's not ideal, her potential gains are diminishing rapidly. If I reject this, she might be willing to accept even a heavily skewed offer in her favor in later rounds just to get something. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable outcome."
