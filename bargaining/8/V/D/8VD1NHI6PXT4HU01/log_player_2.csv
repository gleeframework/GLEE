"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept such an unequal offer right away. I want to see what kind of deal Alice is willing to make in the future rounds, considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fairer, considering the inflation we both face. Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is slightly better than her first one, it's still not fair. I believe I can get a better deal, especially with the inflation factor working against Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, the money is quickly losing value. Let's split it evenly and avoid losing more. It's the most sensible option at this point.""}
```"
