"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 400,000 for me, which is worth 5% less than the original 500,000, and 600,000 for Bob, which is worth 20% less than the original 500,000, I'll consider the offer.

However, I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation rates. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better share.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation rates. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation, but I'm willing to compromise""
