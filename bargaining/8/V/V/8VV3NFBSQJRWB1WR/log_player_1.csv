Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  I'm taking almost everything!  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm assuming Bob will be more likely to accept something rather than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much better offer for Bob than my first one, but I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I still believe I can get a better deal, especially since the inflation only affects Bob's gain.  It's worth seeing if I can get him to come down a bit further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to make a more moderate offer this time. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to give Bob a more substantial portion to incentivize him to accept.  The inflation still works in my favor, so hopefully, he'll see this as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky!  While Bob's share is much higher than in Round 2, the inflation is starting to bite into his potential earnings.  I think it's a good time to take the deal, especially since I'm still getting a decent chunk of the money."
