"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get something rather than risk going home with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. However, I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll aim for a bigger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations. An even split might seem fair, but I think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less than before, so I'll aim for an even bigger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. Let's compromise. This offer gives you the majority, but I get something too. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I need to be extremely cautious. Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is still a decent compromise. I'm not sure if I can do better, and we're running out of time.

I'll accept Bob's offer to get the majority of the remaining money.
