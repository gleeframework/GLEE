Alice is trying to use time pressure against me, but her offer is getting worse! I need to hold my ground a bit longer."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Alice is getting desperate and her offers are reflecting that.  She's clearly underestimating my resolve. I need to hold strong a little longer!"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation working against you.  Don't be stubborn! Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but the time pressure is getting to be too much. Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation disadvantage and her offers are unlikely to improve. Taking the $400,000, even with the 73.79% decrease in value, is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
