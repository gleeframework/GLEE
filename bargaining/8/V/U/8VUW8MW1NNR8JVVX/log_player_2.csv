"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous today, Bob. Take a small slice of the pie.  We can always split things more fairly later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's not fair at all! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation disadvantage I have.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to share, but I need a larger portion to compensate for the upcoming rounds.  Let's be reasonable, or we both risk losing more money. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to lowball me, even though she knows the clock is ticking and my potential gains are decreasing. While $100,000 is better than nothing, I need to hold out for a more equitable split."

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time!  I'm dropping my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but 60/40 is my bottom line.  Let's end this and both get something!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the end. This offer is my final attempt to be fair while ensuring my own financial security. If we can't agree, we both lose more with every passing round. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting desperate, but she's still being too greedy. I need to stand my ground. If she's serious about a deal, she'll offer something better in the next round. It's risky, but I think I can get her closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're down to the wire. I'm offering a slight compromise at 55/45.  Take it now, or we both lose out. Don't let greed get the best of us!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm applying more pressure and showing a willingness to negotiate, but only slightly. A 55/45 split is still in my favor, but the clock is ticking.  By framing this as our last chance, I'm hoping Alice will see the value in securing a win, even if it means accepting a slightly less favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this is my final offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to ensure my own financial security. If we can't agree, we both risk losing everything.  
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but with time running out, I need to be realistic.  Alice has held firm, and her offer is better than nothing. Accepting a 30/70 split ensures I at least get something, whereas continued rejection risks walking away with nothing at all."
