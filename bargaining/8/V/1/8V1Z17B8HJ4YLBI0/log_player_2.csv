Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 49.5 
# Alice gain: 50.5

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to wear me down with incremental concessions, but it's still in my best interest to hold out for a bit longer. Accepting now means losing almost 20% of the initial potential gain. I believe I can still get a better deal."
