"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a slightly better deal than a straight 60/40 split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd receive are:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (since 20% less is equivalent to multiplying by 0.8)
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer for now and see if I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still being somewhat reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal after rejecting your previous offers 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice gain: 4800 / 0.516 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%, or 1 - 0.488 = 0.512, but since we are multiplying by the percentage of 48.8% less, we actually multiply by 1 - 0.488 = 0.512, which is equivalent to dividing by 0.516) = 9303.92
* Bob gain: 5200 / 0.516 = 10087.39

However, I will assume the 48.8% less is equivalent to multiplying by 0.516, so I'll divide by 0.516, not multiply.

* Alice gain: 4800 / 0.516 = 9294.07
* Bob gain: 5200 / 0.516 = 10078.26

I'll round down to the nearest whole number.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.
