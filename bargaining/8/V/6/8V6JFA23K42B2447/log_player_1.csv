"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'll be generous next time! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my share of $30 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is a bit less than $50. Bob's share of $70 is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about getting a smaller share, but I'm willing to wait for a better offer. I'll reject this proposal for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, my offer will be slightly smaller than in the second round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""You were generous last round, but I'm not getting any younger! I'll take a slightly smaller share this time.""
}
```"
