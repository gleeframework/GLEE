"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the time value of money. This is a good deal for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** It's crucial to recognize that delaying an agreement hurts Bob more than Alice. The money loses value for Bob with each round.
* **Stronger Position:**  By round 2, Alice knows Bob is serious about getting a better deal. Offering a slightly higher amount than Alice initially proposed (60/40) shows Bob is willing to negotiate but won't be taken advantage of. 
* **Time Pressure:** The message subtly reminds Alice that time is of the essence. A good deal now is better than an unknown outcome later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Losing Out:** Even though Alice has moved slightly, Bob is still in a significantly worse position than her initial 60/40 offer due to inflation. Accepting now would mean a loss of almost half the potential gain compared to Round 1. 
* **Alice is Feeling the Pressure:** Alice's willingness to compromise indicates she also recognizes that dragging this out isn't ideal. She wants to avoid reaching a point where Bob's offers become unacceptable.
* **Final Round Gamble:** By rejecting, Bob forces a final round where he has control. While risky, it's the strongest move to secure a less unfavorable outcome in the face of continuous inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value any further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This is the last round, and Bob needs to make a decisive move. A 50/50 split leaves no room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting the Shared Risk:** By emphasizing the ""we"" in the message, Bob reminds Alice that delaying any further hurts both of them to some extent. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  While a 50/50 split might seem generous from Bob's perspective given the inflation, it's framed as the most equitable solution under the circumstances. It avoids portraying Bob as greedy or unwilling to compromise.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is inherently risky. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a 50/50 split, even in the final round. 
* Bob needs to be mentally prepared to walk away with nothing if Alice rejects this offer. 
* This assumes Bob values securing *some* gain over the potential for a slightly higher gain with the risk of getting nothing at all."
