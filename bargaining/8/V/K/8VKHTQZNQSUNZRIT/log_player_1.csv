"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself, with a message inviting him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's try to find a better split this time. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000$ is now worth 475,000$.

I don't think this offer is a good deal for me, considering I could have kept 600,000$ in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```

I'm not sure if I'm ready to meet Bob in the middle again, considering I could have kept 550,000$ in the previous round. However, I don't want to give up too much ground either.
