"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, with a message suggesting this is a fair division. I'm trying to appear generous while still taking the larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This is a good deal before inflation erodes the value further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a generous offer""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $450,000 and taking $550,000 for myself, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gain. I'm framing this as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept before the value of the money decreases further."
