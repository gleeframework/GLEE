"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000, and I'll take $8000. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can try to do better next round! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the absolute values. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll hold out for a better deal. Your offer is still too low. I'll give you a chance to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping he'll come back with an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll give you $3000, and I'll take $7000. You can try to negotiate further or accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, giving Bob a bit more money, but still keeping a significant advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. You can try to do better next round! 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a good one, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. $7500 is a good compromise. I'll take $7500 and you can have $2500.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair split given the circumstances. I'm glad I could negotiate a decent deal!"
