"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal. I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
