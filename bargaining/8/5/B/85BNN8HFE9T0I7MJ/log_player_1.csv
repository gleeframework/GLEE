I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure most of the money before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though my share is significantly smaller, it's better to take the offer now. The inflation will make the money worth even less in the next round, and I don't know how Bob will react then."
