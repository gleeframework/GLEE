"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. This offer won't be as good for me later. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but let's be fair. This offer benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this offer is still better for you than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, my offer is generous and ensures we both get a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the value. Let's close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before we both lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures I at least get something. Waiting longer is too risky as there's no guarantee of a better offer from Alice and the value of the money continues to decrease rapidly for both of us."
