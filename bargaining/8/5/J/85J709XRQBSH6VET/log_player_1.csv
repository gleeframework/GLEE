"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a high initial offer to try and secure a quick deal.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I'm betting he'll be willing to accept a small share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the inflation.  It's better to secure half the money now rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
