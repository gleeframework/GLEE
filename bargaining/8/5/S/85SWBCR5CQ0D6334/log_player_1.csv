"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he's willing to accept a relatively low amount to start the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is becoming less valuable, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a large share for you. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I need a better deal for myself.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to get a better deal for myself, considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more considering the initial offer was quite low. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is becoming increasingly devalued, and I need to be even more aggressive in my negotiation. Since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get an even better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept this offer. Given the inflation, I think I deserve a larger share. I'm willing to make a counteroffer, but I need a significant increase.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll try to take advantage of the significant inflation and make a more aggressive offer. Since the money is worth less and less with each passing round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a large share considering the inflation. I need to protect my interests and get a bigger share to account for the devaluation of money.""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll on the value of money, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully. Splitting the money evenly might be a reasonable compromise, given the current situation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split the money evenly. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation and the value of the money.""
