"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split than your offer. It's a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to give you more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40% offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the initial offer was 60/40 in my favor. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I think this split is more reasonable, considering the initial offer was 60/40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you more than 45, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. This way, we both get 45, and it's a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'm getting desperate with the inflation and the limited time left.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think it's better to accept this offer and get 45% of the remaining value than to risk getting nothing if we don't agree."
