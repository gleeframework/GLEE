"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give you the majority. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $7,600.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 40% of the total, but it's a decent offer. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and the risk of getting less in subsequent rounds.
