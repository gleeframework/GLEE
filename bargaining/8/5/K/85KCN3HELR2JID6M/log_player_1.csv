"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive.

My gain would be 400,000, which is 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 (since it's worth 10% less due to inflation).

Bob's gain would be 600,000, which is 600,000 / 0.8 = 750,000 (since it's worth 20% less due to inflation).

I'm not sure I like this offer. It seems like Bob is getting a better deal than I am. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems more favorable to me than the previous offers. Now it's Bob's turn!"
