"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money right away. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is still a good deal. It's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
