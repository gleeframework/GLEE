"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to adjust my gain to account for the 5% inflation. My gain would be 500000 * 0.95 = 475000.

Since Bob's gain remains the same, I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 5% inflation from the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll calculate my gain taking into account the 14.26% inflation from the initial round. My gain would be 400000 * 0.8543 (1 - 0.1457) = 342,920.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
