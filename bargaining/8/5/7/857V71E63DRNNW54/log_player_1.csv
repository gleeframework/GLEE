"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than the original $100, so I'm looking at a gain of $40.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm now considering a gain of $32 (40% of the original $80).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money worth 48.8% less than the original $100, I'm now looking at a gain of $30.80 (30% of the original $100).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 30/70 split, but I'm willing to consider it since it's slightly better than my previous offer.
