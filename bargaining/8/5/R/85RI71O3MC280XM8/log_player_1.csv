"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this gives Bob a decent starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is getting closer to being more fair, but I think I can still get a better deal. Let's see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 

I'm going to offer a slightly more generous split than Bob's last offer.  I'm aiming for a compromise to avoid further rounds and the associated inflation penalties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better split, the inflation is starting to hurt. I'm not confident I can do much better than this offer, so I'll accept."
