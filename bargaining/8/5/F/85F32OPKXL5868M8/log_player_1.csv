"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $1000, and I'll take the rest.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still the one who came up with the idea to play this game! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money worth 10% less than in the first round, $6000 is actually equivalent to $6,000 / 0.9 = $6,667 in the first round. Not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better next time.

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping you'll accept this offer before it's too late.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not giving in too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now. The $4500 I would get in this round is equivalent to $6,667 / 0.727 = $9,167 in the first round, which is still a decent offer.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer yet. I'm hoping to get a better deal, but at the same time, I don't want to risk waiting too long and getting nothing.
