"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair compromise that recognizes my role in the game and allows us to both get a significant portion of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
