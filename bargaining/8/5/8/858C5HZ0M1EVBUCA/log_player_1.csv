"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share since I'm the one making the proposal.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be ready to make another proposal in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll give you a chance to accept 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $6,000 in real value. However, Bob's offer is trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I don't want to give him too big of a share.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it fairly. I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one.""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive again! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting $6,000 in real value. However, Bob's offer is trying to take even more advantage of the inflation, and I'm not comfortable with that.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Bob's offer was getting a bit too greedy, so I'll try to make a more reasonable proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I think we can do better than that. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one.""}

I'm proposing that we split the money exactly in half, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
