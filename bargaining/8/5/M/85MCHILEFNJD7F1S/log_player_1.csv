"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to keep almost everything, giving Bob only $1.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  I'm hoping Bob will be so surprised he accepts it.  But if he rejects it, I'll have to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  this is a significantly better deal than the last round. Accepting ensures I get something, and the inflation risk is too high to gamble on another round."
