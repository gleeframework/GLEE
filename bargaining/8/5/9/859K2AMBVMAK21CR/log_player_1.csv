Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and take $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with me taking a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more even split. Let's try 60/40 in my favor, as I'm losing 20% of my money each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me, I have no incentive to accept a less favorable split.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the fact that the money is worth 20% less to him each round. I'll offer him $45 and take $55 for myself, with a message that acknowledges his concerns about the decreasing value of his share.
