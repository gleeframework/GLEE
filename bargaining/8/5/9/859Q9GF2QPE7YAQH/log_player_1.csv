"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of the money is now worth 80% of 80% of the initial amount, which is 64% of the original 100$. So, in this round, I'd get 64% of the remaining 100$.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Sounds reasonable, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I accept the offer!"
