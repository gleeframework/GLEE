I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm aiming for a large share since I'm the one making the first offer, but I'm leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, getting $6000 is still a good outcome, and it's likely Bob will keep pushing for a larger portion if I reject.  Accepting secures me a decent amount of the money."
