"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take advantage of the inflation, huh?

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My gain of $250,000 is still worth the same as it was in the first round, but Bob's gain of $750,000 is now worth 20% less than it would have been in the first round. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 42-58""
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the money, leaving Bob with 58%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
