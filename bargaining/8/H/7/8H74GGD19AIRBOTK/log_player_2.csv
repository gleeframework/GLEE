"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a good starting point to understand the game's dynamics. Bob should reject this offer. While it seems fair at first glance, the inflation will significantly impact the value of the money in the following rounds.  It's better for Bob to see what Alice's next offer will be, considering the inflation rate will favor him more in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation will benefit you less in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic - the inflation is working against you much faster. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob might be tempted to reject and hope for a better offer in the next round, the inflation rate is severely working against him. Alice's offer is more favorable for him than the previous one, and waiting for another round will only diminish the value of his share further. Accepting is the best strategy to maximize his gains in this situation."
