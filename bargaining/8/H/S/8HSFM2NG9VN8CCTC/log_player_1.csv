"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 75-25 split, which is quite skewed in his favor.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less now. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is still quite skewed in his favor.

I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, I need to be even more aggressive in my offer. I'll try to push for a more even split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a huge disparity in the split, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and even division of the remaining money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
