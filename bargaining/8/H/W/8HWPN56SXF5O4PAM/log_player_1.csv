Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share of the money, hoping he'll accept it quickly and we can avoid the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, taking 500,000 is a good deal considering the inflation penalty.  It's more than I'd get if we continue playing."
