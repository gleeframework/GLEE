"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split. Accept and let's be done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Let me know if he accepts or if we need to proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55-45.  It's a fair compromise and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
