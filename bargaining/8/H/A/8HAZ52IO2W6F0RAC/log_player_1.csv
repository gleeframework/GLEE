I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000 dollars. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will affect Bob more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000 dollars, which is significantly more than his previous offer, but still allows me to secure a large portion of the money.  Since he rejected my initial offer, it shows he's willing to negotiate. This offer shows good faith and hopefully leads to an agreement before the inflation hurts us both further."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slightly better split than before, the inflation is hurting Bob far more than me.  I need to keep pushing for a better deal, especially since we have several rounds left."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm offering Bob 50,000 dollars.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I'm hoping that with the increasing inflation affecting Bob more drastically, he will be more willing to accept a smaller portion to avoid losing more of his potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, despite Bob offering a higher percentage than in the previous round. The inflation is making a significant impact on Bob, and he will likely be more willing to accept a smaller share in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 980000, ""bob_gain"": 20000}
```

I'm going to make a final push for a good deal, offering Bob a small portion of the money.  I believe he'll accept this, as the inflation is going to drastically reduce his potential gains in the remaining rounds.  This is a risky move, but I'm confident it will pay off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 850000 
# Bob gain: 150000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer, despite being a decrease from his previous round, is now more appealing due to the significant inflation impacting him.  Accepting this offer ensures I receive a large share of the money, and with the little time remaining, I can't risk further negotiation."
