"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 10% less this round, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer because I'd be getting only $270,000 in real value (70% of $300,000), which is less than I initially proposed in Round 1.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, and I'll take $420,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the real value of the money I'd gain from Bob's offer, considering the 27.1% inflation. Since the money is worth 72.9% of its original value, I'd get:

$450,000 * 0.729 = $327,900

This is more than my offer in Round 1, which was $600,000 in real value. I'll accept this offer.
