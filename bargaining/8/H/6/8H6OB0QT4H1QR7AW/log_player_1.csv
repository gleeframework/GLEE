"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one, let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, I would be getting $400,000, which is equivalent to $320,000 in the first round. That's a significant reduction. However, Bob is still getting $600,000, which is the same as in the first round.

Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I think I should try to negotiate further. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation""
}
```

In this round, I'm proposing a 60% share for myself and a 40% share for Bob. I'm hoping that this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob, while still taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet, let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I would be getting $460,000, which is equivalent to $320,000 in the first round. Considering the 48.8% reduction in value due to inflation, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Since the money is decreasing in value rapidly, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think I deserve a larger share considering the inflation""
}
```

In this round, I'm proposing a 70% share for myself and a 30% share for Bob. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as the money is decreasing in value rapidly and I'm trying to get a better deal before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet, let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I would be getting $520,000, which is equivalent to $160,000 in the first round. Considering the 67.23% reduction in value due to inflation, I think this offer is relatively reasonable.

However, I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal, but I'll have to be careful since the money is decreasing in value rapidly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve a large share considering the inflation""
}
```

In this round, I'm proposing a 90% share for myself and a 10% share for Bob. I'm taking a risk by offering a very large share to myself, but I think the inflation has reduced the value of the money so much that it's worth it. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also aware that he might reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's settle for a 50/50 split and avoid further risk 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I would be getting $500,000, which is equivalent to $64,000 in the first round. Considering the 79.03% reduction in value due to inflation, I think this offer is actually quite reasonable.

Since the money is decreasing in value rapidly, I think it's wise to take the 50/50 split and avoid further risk. I'll accept Bob's offer.
