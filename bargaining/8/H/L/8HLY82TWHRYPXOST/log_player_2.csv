**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  While the deal is getting worse, I'm banking on her not letting it go to zero.  I need to apply more pressure."

**Reasoning:**

I need to start showing some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a slightly advantageous split. The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept before the deal gets worse for both of us."

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't great, it's better than getting zero if we run out of rounds.  Alice is clearly willing to let this go to the end, and I can't risk that."
