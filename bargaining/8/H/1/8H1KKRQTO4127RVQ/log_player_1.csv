Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't give in so easily. He's lost almost half the value of his share, and I still have more time."

Bob is getting desperate, but I'm not going to cave in yet. His offer is still too low, and the inflation is working in my favor. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering an even split now.  We're running out of time, and inflation is hurting Bob's share tremendously. I'm hoping this is a fair solution that we can both agree to."
