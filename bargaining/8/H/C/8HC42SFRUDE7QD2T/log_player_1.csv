Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by taking the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a very aggressive move, but since inflation heavily impacts Bob, I want to maximize my share right away.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair. While I'm only getting $1, he's taking almost everything.  Even though the value of money is decreasing for him, it's not worth accepting such a lopsided deal. I'll reject and see if we can reach a more reasonable compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time I'm going for a fair split.  The money is still losing value, especially for Bob, so a 50/50 split seems like the most logical choice."
