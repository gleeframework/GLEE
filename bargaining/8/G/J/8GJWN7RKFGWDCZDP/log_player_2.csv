Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

``` 

Explanation: 

While not ideal, accepting this offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players, but especially for Alice. Waiting any longer significantly erodes the potential gains for both sides.
* **Offer Comparison:** Alice's offer in round 3 is actually better for Bob than her initial offer in round 1 when considering the impact of inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Alice offering even less in future rounds, where the money will be worth even less.

It's a tough decision, but accepting minimizes potential losses from inflation and secures a reasonable share for Bob.
