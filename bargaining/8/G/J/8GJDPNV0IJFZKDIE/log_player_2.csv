Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5600

``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to hit hard. It's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
