"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering inflation will affect the value of the money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected, considering the value of the money will decrease further in future rounds.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger share, considering the decreasing value of money""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but we both need to consider the inflation that will affect the value of the money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money Bob gains due to inflation, I think his offer is a bit more reasonable now. However, I'm still not willing to accept a 40% gain for myself, especially since the value of my gain remains the same as in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor continuing to decrease the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the situation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to accept, or I'll take it all""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
