I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I think I can do better. I'm looking for a more balanced split, and Bob's offer is still quite skewed in his favor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer again, as it's still not a balanced split. I'm starting to feel like I'm being squeezed out, and I'm not comfortable with the decreasing share I'm getting. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
