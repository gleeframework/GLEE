"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's get this game moving! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain would be 4500 * 0.95 = 4275.

I'm not sure if a 55-45 split is fair, considering I was initially offered a 40% share and now I'm being offered 45%. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth another 5% less, so my gain would be 4275 * 0.95 = 4051.25.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better share.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation is affecting us both equally.""
