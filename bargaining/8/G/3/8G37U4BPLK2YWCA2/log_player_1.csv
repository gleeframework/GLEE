"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll follow 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the lead, huh?

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $4000, which is worth 95% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should wait for a better one.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will come up with something better.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go higher!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he'll accept or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not done yet! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up! My gain is worth even less now.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully about it. He's pushing the split even further in his favor, but I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will come up with something more reasonable.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting all the cake, Bob! I'm making a better offer!""

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I can do better. This offer is even more skewed in his favor, and I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a more generous offer or if I can come up with a better one myself.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

Considering Bob's final offer, I'm getting a bit desperate. The split is extremely skewed in his favor, and I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better deal. With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to think that accepting this offer might be my best bet.
