"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my gain to account for the 5% inflation. Since I initially had a gain of $6,000, the new value of my gain is $6,000 * 0.95 = $5,700.

With that in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 50-50 split, especially since I'm losing some value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than in the previous round, so my gain is $5,700 * 0.95 = $5,415.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to account for the inflation, but I'm not willing to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my gain's value after the inflation in round 4. My gain in round 3 was $5,500, and the inflation is 5% less than the previous round, which was 5% of $5,500, so the inflation is $275. So, my gain in round 4 is $5,500 - $275 = $5,225.

Now, let's evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with this offer. I think I deserve more considering the inflation has affected me more severely than you.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for his next proposal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let's calculate my gain's value after the inflation in round 5. My gain in round 4 was $5,225, and the inflation is 5% less than the previous round, which was 5% of $5,225, so the inflation is $260.25. So, my gain in round 5 is $5,225 - $260.25 = $4,964.75.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the inflation.""
}

I'm offering Bob $4,800 and keeping $5,200 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my gain's value after the inflation in round 6. My gain in round 5 was $4,964.75, and the inflation is 5% less than the previous round, which was 5% of $4,964.75, so the inflation is $248.82. So, my gain in round 6 is $4,964.75 - $248.82 = $4,715.93.

Now, let's evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

My gain in round 6 was $4,715.93, and the inflation is 5% less than the previous round, which was 5% of $4,715.93, so the inflation is $235.99. So, my gain in round 7 is $4,715.93 - $235.99 = $4,479.94.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more to account for the initial proposal.""
