"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Let's see if you'll accept!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a fair starting point to see if Bob will accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has countered with a 60-40 split in his favor, claiming it's fairer due to inflation. However, I'm not convinced.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not convinced that 60-40 is fair, considering we just started. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect still in play, my offer will be worth less in real terms than in the previous rounds. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a bigger share this round. But I'm still not giving up my advantage!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the upper hand."
