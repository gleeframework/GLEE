Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small cut."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with a 50/50 split, especially since the value of my share is decreasing.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still giving him something. Hopefully, this is enough to make him accept."
