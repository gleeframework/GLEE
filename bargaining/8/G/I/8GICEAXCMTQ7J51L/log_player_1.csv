"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 80% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the reduced value of money due to inflation. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach an agreement."
