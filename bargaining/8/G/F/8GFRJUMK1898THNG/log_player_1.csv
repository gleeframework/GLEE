"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will be willing to accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob has turned the tables on me!

I'll carefully consider his new offer, taking into account the inflation factor. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll be getting $40, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he'll be getting $48.

Considering the risk Bob is taking by rejecting my previous offer, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again! With the inflation factor still in play, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the remaining amount evenly. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement and avoid further negotiations."
