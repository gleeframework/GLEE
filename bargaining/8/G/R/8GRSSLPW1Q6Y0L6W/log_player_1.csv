"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering to split the $100 equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of the money. However, I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, as I was hoping for a more even split.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm trying to get a better deal this time by offering a slightly more favorable split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a decent one. The 45-55 split is still not ideal, but I'm starting to realize that I might not get a better deal if I reject this offer.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more reasonable in future rounds.
