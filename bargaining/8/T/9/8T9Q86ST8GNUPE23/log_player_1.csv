"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to make up for it. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a bit more this time. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}"
