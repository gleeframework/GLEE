"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept a decent share right away, remember the inflation.  It's better to see if we can get a better deal in the later rounds, even if it risks getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a more even split.  Let's be reasonable and avoid further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile after the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice has lowered her share from 900k to 600k. While my share is less than my proposed 550k, the inflation is hitting hard, and I am not sure if I can get a better deal. It's a good enough compromise for me, and I'm willing to accept it."
