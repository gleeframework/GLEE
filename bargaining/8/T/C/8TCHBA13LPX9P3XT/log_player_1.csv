"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio, with you receiving $3000. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split.  This is still a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money, and I'm willing to give you a larger share than you offered me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
