"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering the majority of the money is going to him.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher percentage of the remaining money, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself."
