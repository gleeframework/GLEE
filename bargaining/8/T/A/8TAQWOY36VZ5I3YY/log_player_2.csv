**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly. It's time to play hardball. There's still a chance to get a better deal, and even if we have to accept a less favorable offer later, it's better than letting Alice dictate the terms."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it. A perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law. Alice needs to understand the gravity of the situation. By offering a 50/50 split, we're demonstrating firmness while still being fair. The ""take it or leave it"" message emphasizes the urgency and signals that we're not budging. It's a risky move, but the dwindling value of the money means we need to force a decision."
