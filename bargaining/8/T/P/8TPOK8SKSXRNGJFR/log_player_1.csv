"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself. The message is a simple ""Let's split fairly"" to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we need to account for. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although Bob's message tries to justify the split by mentioning inflation, I believe the offer is still not in my favor. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I see no reason to accept less than what I initially offered Bob. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal that better suits my interests."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my initial offer to $6500 for myself and decreasing Bob's share to $3500. Given that the money is worth 20% less to Bob now (10% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I believe my offer is more than generous. The message aims to remind Bob of the impact of inflation on his gains and to persuade him that accepting this offer is the best decision he can make at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the best I can do given the inflation. If you reject this, we'll both get less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer. In this round, Bob's offer matches the initial proposal I made in Round 1, which I considered fair. Given that the money is still worth the same to me but significantly less to Bob due to inflation, I believe accepting this offer is in my best interest. There's also the risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might propose an even less favorable split in the next round, or the game could continue indefinitely with neither of us willing to accept the other's proposal. By accepting now, I secure a gain of $6000, which aligns with my initial assessment of a fair split.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
