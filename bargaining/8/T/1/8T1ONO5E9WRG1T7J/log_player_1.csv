"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40% of the money, which is $400,000."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 25% of the total, even if it's worth 20% less than my initial proposal. I'll try to negotiate further or make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the total, even if it's worth 48.8% less than my initial proposal. I'll have to think carefully about my next move, as the stakes are getting higher and the money is worth less and less."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but still gives me a decent chunk of the money."
