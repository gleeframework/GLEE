"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take a small amount to get the ball rolling.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a significant amount, but I'm willing to give you a small share to keep the negotiations going. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $2,000
Bob's gain: $7,200

I'll accept this offer. I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I'd rather get something now than risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.
