"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This offer is a bit cheeky, but it's a way to show Bob that I'm serious about getting most of the money.  It's also a way to gauge his reaction and see if he's willing to play this game seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable offer.  There's no point in risking getting nothing by continuing to play."
