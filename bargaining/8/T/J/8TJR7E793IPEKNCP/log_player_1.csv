"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a generous offer in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. It's much lower than my first offer, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic drop in my share.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
``` 

I'm still trying to get a good share of the money.  Since Bob rejected my first offer and then offered me a very small amount, I'm lowering my offer slightly to try and find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  His offer is still significantly lower than the first round, and I won't settle for such a small share.  I'll keep fighting for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, taking inflation into account.  I'm hoping Bob sees that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before it's too late and we both lose out on a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair. I'm still not willing to accept such a low share, especially with the amount of inflation we've seen.  I will continue to fight for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer again, keeping in mind the inflation and the pattern of Bob's offers. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, he'll finally accept a deal before it's too late for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially given the significant inflation. I'm determined to get a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096} 
```

I'm still trying to find a compromise, even with the increasing inflation. I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself, hoping that Bob will finally see the value of reaching an agreement."
