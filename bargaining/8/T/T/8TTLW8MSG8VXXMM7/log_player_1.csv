# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me due to inflation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than 50% of the remaining value.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for Round 3.
