Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split.  I think that's a good starting point, especially considering inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and the money is worth less due to inflation. I will reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% this time, which is still less than my initial offer but more than his counter-offer. Since the money is losing value with each round, it's important to find a solution quickly. I hope he'll see it's in his best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me, even with the inflation effect. I'm losing more value than Bob, and his offer is far less than my initial proposal. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share again to try to get a deal.  I'm offering Bob 30% of the money. While the money is losing value, I'm still confident I can secure a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough choice.  While I'd prefer to get a better deal,  I've lost a significant amount of value due to inflation.  The money is shrinking rapidly, and Bob's offer, although not ideal, is the best I've seen so far.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all. I'll accept Bob's offer."
