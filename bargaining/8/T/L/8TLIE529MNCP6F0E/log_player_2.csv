Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go lower than this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is anchoring on a 50/50 split, but the longer the game goes on, the more the inflation benefits me.  I need to push for a larger share while being mindful that we are running out of rounds."

""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to 40% for me, 60% for you.  But I need to see a little more compromise from your side to get this deal done. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob! While he could potentially push for more in later rounds, the risk of Alice becoming increasingly resistant due to the inflation is significant. Accepting 60% now guarantees a good outcome and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if the negotiations completely stall."
