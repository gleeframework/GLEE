"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's a bit less valuable to me.

I'll think about it...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a larger share of the money while it's still worth something. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money in this round:

My gain of 4500 is worth 85.7% of what it was in the first round (100% - 14.26% = 85.7%).

Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 44% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% = 51.2% * 85% = 43.6%, rounded to 44% for simplicity).

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think about it...
