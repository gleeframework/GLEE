"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000 dollars. This is a fair offer considering I am the first to propose, and there is a risk that Bob might reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and I'm not sure what kind of offer Bob will make in the next round. With inflation, the money will only be worth less."
