I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This is a pretty generous offer to start, and hopefully he'll accept it.  Let's see what he says!"

I'm still willing to be generous, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of. This time I'm offering $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."

I'm starting to get a little nervous about inflation, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal. This time I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give in to his demands."

I'm getting desperate now, but I'm still hoping for a reasonable deal. This time I'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob.  I'm really hoping he'll accept this, as I don't think I can go much lower without losing too much myself."

I'm throwing in the towel. Inflation is really hurting me, and I don't think I can afford to keep rejecting Bob's offers.  I'm offering an even split of $5,000 each. Let's just get this over with."
