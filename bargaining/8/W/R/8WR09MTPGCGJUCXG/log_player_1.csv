Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer.  I figure Bob might be willing to take a smaller share to get something now rather than risk getting nothing at all if the money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the money is depreciating quickly. It's better to secure 60% now, even with the 20% devaluation, than risk getting nothing in the next round."
