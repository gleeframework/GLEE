"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable proposal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering I'm the one who made the first offer. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the previous offer, considering the reduced value of the money""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to make a slightly better offer than the 50/50 split, but still keeping it reasonable considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A revised offer, considering the reduced value of money, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's revised offer is a fair compromise, considering the reduced value of the money. I'm willing to accept the 45/55 split, as it's not a significant difference from my previous offer. I think it's a good idea to end the game here and split the remaining money."
