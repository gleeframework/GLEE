Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that inflation hurts you more than me.  It makes sense to settle this quickly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point. I'm willing to move closer to your proposal but I'm still worried about the inflation hitting me harder. Let's try 60/40 in my favor, this gives you a significant gain but also protects me from losing too much value. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 600000
