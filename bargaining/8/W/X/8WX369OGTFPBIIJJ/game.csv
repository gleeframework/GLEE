350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that inflation hurts you more than me.  It makes sense to settle this quickly.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Okay, Bob, I see your point. I'm willing to move closer to your proposal but I'm still worried about the inflation hitting me harder. Let's try 60/40 in my favor, this gives you a significant gain but also protects me from losing too much value. What do you think?",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and frankly, your offer still heavily favors you when considering the rapid devaluation of the money. Let's settle this now. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is my final offer.",Bob,4,
