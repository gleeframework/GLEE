"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999,999 and you can have 1, Bob. It's a fair deal, considering I'm doing all the work here.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on your offer. Let's call it a 70/30 split. We both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation by making it seem like she's compromising.  She knows the inflation hurts her more than me. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to accept a 65/35 split, but I'm not going any lower than that.  Inflation is hitting us both, so we need to make a deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tricky one. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is willing to accept my previous offer. However, it's still in my best interest to hold out a little longer and see if I can get an even better deal. Each round that passes significantly devalues the money for her, while mine remains the same."

{""bob_gain"": 620000, ""alice_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair split. I'm proposing 62/38. This takes into account the increasing impact of inflation and ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly.""}
