Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know it's getting ridiculous, but I think I can get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I should accept. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less my potential gains are worth due to inflation.  
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and rejecting this offer means I risk getting even less in future rounds. 
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** 42 is significantly less than I aimed for, but it's better than holding out and potentially getting a much worse deal later, or even nothing."
