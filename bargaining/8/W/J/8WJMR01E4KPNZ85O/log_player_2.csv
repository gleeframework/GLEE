Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should take this, it's getting worse for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While it's true the deal is getting worse with each round, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting anything less than a 50/50 split at this point would be giving in to her pressure tactics."
