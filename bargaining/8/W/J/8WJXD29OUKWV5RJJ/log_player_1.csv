"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial 100$ and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect. However, I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split either. I was hoping to get a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining 100$ and leave 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's side!

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about the 48-52 split, but I'm also aware that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll have to weigh my options carefully...
