"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This seems like a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point, it's crucial to consider the impact of inflation.  Since Alice's share loses less value than mine, rejecting this offer and making a counterproposal in the next round gives me more leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a slightly more even split to account for inflation. This way, we both benefit a little more over time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, we're running out of time. This offer is fair considering the inflation is working against me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split than my previous offer. The time constraint and the fact that Alice's money is losing value at a faster rate make this offer a good choice.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant share and avoids the risk of losing everything."
