"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $500,000 in value, but Bob's offer is now worth 5% less for him.

I'll reject this offer, since I'd prefer to get a larger share. My current gain is $500,000, and Bob's offer is $600,000, but the value of that is 5% less due to inflation. I'd rather negotiate further to try to get a better deal.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share. What do you think, Bob?""
