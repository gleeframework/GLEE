"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small share to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm willing to give him a chance to accept and end the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled with this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
