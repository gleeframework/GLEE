"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60, leaving $40 for Bob. She justifies her proposal by suggesting it's a fair division, with her taking only a bit more than half. The message is brief and attempts to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, hoping he will accept the proposal without feeling too disadvantaged. The offer also reflects Alice's awareness of the inflation factor, as she tries to secure a larger share upfront to counteract the devaluation of money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This round is our best shot. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer. Despite the inflation factor reducing the value of the money for both players, Alice seems to believe that accepting 45 dollars, which is now worth 20% less than in the first round, is not the best deal she can get. She might be hoping to negotiate a better offer in the next round or is willing to take the risk of further inflation to potentially secure a larger share. The decision to reject also reflects Alice's negotiation strategy, possibly aiming to push Bob to make a more favorable offer in the subsequent round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Getting serious, this is my best offer considering the circumstances""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $58, leaving $42 for Bob. Her message conveys a sense of urgency and seriousness, implying that she's making a genuine effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. By offering Bob a slightly larger share than in her first proposal, Alice is attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both players. The message also subtly hints that this might be the best deal Bob can expect, given the decreasing value of the money in subsequent rounds."
