"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with $900,000. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original value, so I'm considering Bob's offer.

Since the money is now worth less, I'd like to get a slightly larger share. I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve the majority. Try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think we should be closer to even.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money. My gain is now worth 72.9% of the original value.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than before, but I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'd like to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the further inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you can do better next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $350,000, which is a bit more than before, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think we should be closer to a 50/50 split.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us before the inflation gets too bad. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit on the value of the money. My gain is now worth 59.05% of the original value.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'd like to get a bit more. However, I'm also worried that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease, making it even harder to get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, but I'll keep in mind that I might have left some money on the table.
