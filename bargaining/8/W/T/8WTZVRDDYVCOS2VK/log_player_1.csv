"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is the same as the previous round, I would actually be gaining less than I initially proposed in Round 1.

I will reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation that has already occurred. Since my money is worth 20% less, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is the same as the original, I would be gaining even less than I initially proposed in Round 1.

However, considering the current state of the game, I think I should accept this offer. It's a better deal than what I would get if I were to continue playing and risk losing even more value due to inflation.
