I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure I'll take the majority since I'm making the first offer.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'm not thrilled with this offer, it's better than the 5% inflation I would face if I rejected it.  I'll take the 6000, and hope Bob is happy."
