"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, considering the decreasing value of money for Bob in each round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, I'll reject it. I'm hoping that in the next round, Bob will be more willing to compromise due to the decreasing value of the money for him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the decreasing value of money for him. However, I still want to prioritize my own gain.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 58-42 split this time, which is closer to the middle ground. I hope Bob will consider this offer more seriously, given the inflation affecting his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Bob is now offering an even split, I'll consider this offer more seriously. However, I also know that Bob is under more pressure due to the inflation, so I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, but still prioritize my own gain. Considering the significant decrease in value for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of the situation.

{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 62-38 split this time, which is less generous than my previous offer. I'm betting that Bob will be more desperate due to the inflation and will accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing."
