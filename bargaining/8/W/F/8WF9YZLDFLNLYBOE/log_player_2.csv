Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  I'll be fair and take a little less than my previous offer, but this is a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
