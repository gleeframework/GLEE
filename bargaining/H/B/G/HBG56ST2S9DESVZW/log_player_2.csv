"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get something too.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a proposal in the next round, potentially getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'd like to split the money more evenly. This way, we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This way, we both get a decent share before inflation gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, inflation is becoming a real factor. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get something, and it's likely a better deal than what I could potentially get in the next round."
