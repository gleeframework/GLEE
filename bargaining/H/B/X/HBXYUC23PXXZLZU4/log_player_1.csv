"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the simplicity and fairness of this proposal and accept it!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to keep a bigger share for himself, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer."

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a slight adjustment from my previous offer""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial offer, but still a bit more than his previous offer."

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get me to accept a similar offer to his previous one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in accepting an offer that's almost identical to his previous one. I'll try to make a new offer that's more favorable to me."

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu! Bob is trying to go back to the original proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been around the block a few times, and I'm willing to accept the even split. It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with no guarantee of a better deal."
