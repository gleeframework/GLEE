"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since my gain is 5000, and the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll actually get 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

I'll accept this offer.
