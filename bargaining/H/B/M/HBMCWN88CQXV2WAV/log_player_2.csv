Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money evenly this time. It seems like we're both stuck in a loop of back-and-forth offers, so a 50/50 split seems like the most fair solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
