Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 20/80, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 25, ""alice_gain"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's offer is still a 2/3 split, which is more in her favor than my previous offer, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to get a better ratio for myself. I'll offer a 60/40 split, but since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the reduced value.
