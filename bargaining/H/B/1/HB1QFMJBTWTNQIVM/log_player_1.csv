"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I want to maximize my gain, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60% to him and 40% to me, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering a 55.5/44.5 split, trying to get a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting Bob's gain more significantly, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get an even better deal, considering the inflation is affecting him more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 48% to him and 52% to me, I'll try to push for an even more favorable split. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, trying to get an even bigger share of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate continuing to affect Bob's gain, I'll try to take advantage of it. However, Bob's offer in Round 6 is actually a 52/48 split, which is a slight improvement from his previous offer. Considering the inflation and the fact that I'm not getting a significantly better deal, I'll accept this offer.
