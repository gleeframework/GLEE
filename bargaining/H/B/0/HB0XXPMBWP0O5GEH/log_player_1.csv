Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose we split the money 999,000 to me and 1,000 to Bob. This is a large share for me, but I want to see if Bob will accept it knowing he gets a small share but gets to keep it without having to wait for the next round and risking losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
