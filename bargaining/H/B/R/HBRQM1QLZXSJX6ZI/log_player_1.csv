"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, can we compromise?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10$ and keeping 90$ for myself, with the message of starting with a small difference to see if we can find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 50$ is now worth 45$. I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best option, but I'll consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
