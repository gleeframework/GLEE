"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0}

I'm offering to take the entire $100 for myself, but I know this is unlikely to be accepted!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer this time.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
