"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept getting nothing! Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5}
``` 
I'll offer Alice a small share, hoping she'll accept it.  This is a good starting point, and I can increase her share if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take the $40.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is starting to hurt, and it's better to get something than risk getting nothing."
