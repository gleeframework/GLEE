"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. It's risky, but it might end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Even with inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm hoping Bob will be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still offering a reasonable share to Bob.  Hopefully, he'll realize that it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation further reduces his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even with inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm hoping that with each passing round, Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to come to a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation is getting pretty severe, and I think it's time to compromise. This offer is fair and hopefully, Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to accept."
