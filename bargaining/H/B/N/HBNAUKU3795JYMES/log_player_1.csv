"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 20%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a generous offer and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, a 50/50 split is the most equitable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the total amount is now $950,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I think it's a fair offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept Bob's offer.
