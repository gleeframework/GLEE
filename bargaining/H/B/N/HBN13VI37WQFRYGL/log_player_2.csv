"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. Take $1,000 and I'll keep the rest. I'm willing to negotiate further if you think it's not enough. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""That's absurd, Alice. Let's be realistic. I'll take $900,000 and you can have $100,000.  This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you $50,000, but I need to keep the majority to avoid losing too much from inflation. Let's try to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm dropping my offer slightly to $800,000.  Accept this, and we both walk away with something substantial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give you $150,000, but I need to keep the majority to avoid significant losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage against Bob. While $150,000 is more than previous offers, it's still a small portion of the total. Bob needs to show firmness, otherwise, Alice will continue lowballing him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now.  $700,000 for me. It's a fair split, and it saves us both from further losses due to inflation.  Don't let this drag on any longer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to the deadline. I'm willing to offer you $250,000 to prevent us both from getting nothing. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using scare tactics now, claiming a ""final offer."" However,  Bob still has some leverage. While the inflation is working against him, Alice also doesn't want to walk away with nothing. Bob needs to show he's willing to risk it all to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. I'm standing firm at $600,000.  It's a reasonable deal considering the circumstances. If you reject this, we're both playing a dangerous game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are running out of time. This is my final offer: $650,000 for me, $350,000 for you. If you reject this, we're both risking losing everything. Think about it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time pressure is significant. While not ideal, $350,000 is a substantial sum, even with the inflation considered. 

Here's why accepting is the best course of action now:

* **Time Pressure:** Only three rounds remain.  The risk of walking away with nothing is very high if Bob rejects this offer.
* **Improved Offer:**  Alice has finally increased her offer to a point where it's somewhat reasonable. 
* **Unpredictable Outcome:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in the remaining rounds. She might be bluffing, or she might be perfectly content to let the deal fall apart.

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now secures Bob a decent payout, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
