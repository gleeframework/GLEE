Even though it's not an even split, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of Alice's potential gain diminishes significantly with each round. Waiting any longer means a worse deal for Alice.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob is consistently aiming for a larger share and exploiting the inflation disadvantage. It's unlikely he'll offer anything better than this.
* **Minimizing Losses:** Accepting this offer cuts losses compared to risking further devaluation and potentially getting an even worse deal in later rounds."
