"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my offer, now it's my turn to make a better one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53
* Bob's gain: $6,000

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:
