Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but let's make it fair. This way we both still benefit greatly from an early agreement.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's settle this now. This offer is a good balance between your previous proposal and mine.  We both lose out if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to find a middle ground, the deal is still getting worse for me with each round.  It's better to hold out and hope he becomes more reasonable as the stakes get higher with fewer rounds remaining."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is more than fair, and it's the best you'll get at this point. Let's be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, but he's still trying to take a larger share. The inflation is hurting me more, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer.  He'll be more open to a better deal for me as the rounds dwindle, especially since we both get nothing if we fail to agree."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to go for a final push with a strong, fair offer.  A 50/50 split emphasizes fairness while conveying the seriousness of the diminishing returns.  This gives Bob a clear choice: accept a reasonable deal or risk everything with only five rounds remaining."
