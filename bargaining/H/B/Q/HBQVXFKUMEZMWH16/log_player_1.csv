I'm going to be greedy and take the majority, but still leave Bob with something to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation has made the money I get worth less, and the next round will see even greater losses. It's better to take what I can get now."
