Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 60 in this round is equivalent to 40 in the first round. Alice's gain of 40 is equivalent to 60 in the first round. This is actually a better offer than what I made in round 2, but worse than what Alice offered in round 1.
