I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept getting only $1000! Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice $1,000, and keep $9,000 for myself.  I think that's a fair offer considering I'm the one making the proposal this time.  Let's see if she agrees."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it!  A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather get $5,000 than risk getting nothing in the end."
