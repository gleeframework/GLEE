I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  I'm not going to accept that offer.  I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This time, I'm offering an even split. It's fair and hopefully will lead to an agreement."
