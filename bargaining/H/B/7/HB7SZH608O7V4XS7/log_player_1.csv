"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game, hoping to set a good tone and make it easy for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share this time.

I'll have to be careful, since the money is worth less with each passing round. However, 4000$ is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with less money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
