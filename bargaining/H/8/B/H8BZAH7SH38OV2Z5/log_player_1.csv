{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  This is a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority but still allows Bob some compensation."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is much worse for me than the first round.  While it's not as bad as getting nothing, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is closer to being even, it's still not a good deal for me. The inflation has taken a heavy toll on my potential earnings, but I'm still hoping for a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very close offer, and the inflation is eating away at my potential earnings quickly.  I'm going to accept this offer, as it's the closest to a fair split we've had so far."
