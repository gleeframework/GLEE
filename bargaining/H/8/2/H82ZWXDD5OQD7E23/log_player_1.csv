"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob would take the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the numbers, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to split the remaining money evenly. That's a fair offer, considering the current state of the economy.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
