"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. I figure it's fair for me to get the larger share since I'm the one making the offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is better than the 90/10 split he rejected in the previous round. While it's not ideal, accepting ensures I get at least half the remaining money."
