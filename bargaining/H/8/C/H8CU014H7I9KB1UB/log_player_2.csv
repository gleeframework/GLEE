Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm taking a hit on the inflation with this offer. 55/45 seems fair given the circumstances.  It's better than what awaits us in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
