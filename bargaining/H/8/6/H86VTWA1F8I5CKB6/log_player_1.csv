"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable offer. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch roles. I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation rate will benefit me more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $320,000 in the first round (400,000 * 0.8). Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to take into account the inflation rates for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the first round, and considering another 20% decrease for me and 5% decrease for Bob compared to the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\n\nLet's calculate the adjusted value for me: 1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 640,000. And for Bob: 1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 902,500.\n\nConsidering these adjusted values, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust our gains fairly""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this offer!"
