"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a fairly aggressive first offer, aiming to secure the vast majority of the money for Alice. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this in the first round, it establishes a clear strategy for Alice: maximize her share early on, knowing that the value of money will decrease with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me half the money. With inflation kicking in, it's risky to keep playing.  It's better to secure something now than potentially lose more in future rounds."
