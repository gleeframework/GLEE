"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 63% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be cautious. Bob's offer is 50/50, but it's a fair offer and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower potential gain.
