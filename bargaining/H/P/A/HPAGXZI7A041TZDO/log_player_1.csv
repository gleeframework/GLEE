Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided offer. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'll take almost everything. This way, if inflation hurts him more, he'll be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it would be nice to get more, I'm not sure how inflation will affect things in the future. It's better to take a guaranteed 400,000 now than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
