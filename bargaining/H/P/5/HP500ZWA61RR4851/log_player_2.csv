Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable split. I take $600,000, you take $400,000.  A fair deal considering the risk of inflation.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll take $550,000 and you get $450,000.  This is fair considering the time pressure from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

I'm still holding out for more!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're losing money fast!  Let's split it evenly: $500,000 each.  Take it or leave it, it's our last chance for a decent deal. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

It's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers, and a 50/50 split isn't bad considering how much money we've lost.  Let's take it!"
