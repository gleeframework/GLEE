"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is a risky move, but it's designed to get the ball rolling. Bob has a strong incentive to accept in the first round, as he gets something rather than nothing.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and with inflation taking its toll, it's in my best interest to accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
