"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm confident that we can find a better split than that. Let's try a more even 60-40 distribution in my favor this time.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's revised offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, I'll try to counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 52-48 is a more reasonable split""}

I'm offering Bob 480,000 and keeping 520,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
