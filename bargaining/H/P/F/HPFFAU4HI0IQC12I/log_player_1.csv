  ""bob_gain"": 500000,

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. 

After considering it, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With my gains worth 14.26% less than the original, I need to be even more cautious. I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially since I'm losing more value with each passing round.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob to make another move, hoping he'll be willing to compromise."

# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my share worth 22.62% less than the original, I'm getting desperate. However, I'm not willing to accept a 28-72 split, especially since Bob seems to be getting a bigger share with each passing round.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'll have to think carefully about my next move, as the stakes are getting higher and the value of my potential gains is decreasing rapidly."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of room to maneuver, Bob. This is my last chance to get a decent share. Meet me at 32-68?""
}
