Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a fair deal too. How about this?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Due to inflation, the longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential share is worth.  It's in Bob's best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
* **Negotiation:**  While Alice's initial offer heavily favored her, Bob needs to make a counter-offer that is appealing enough for Alice to consider while still being advantageous to himself. 
* **The Offer:** By offering Alice slightly more than she would have gotten in the previous round (if Bob accepted), Bob creates an incentive for Alice to accept. Bob is also taking into account that his share is now worth 20% less than in the previous round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice is slowly increasing Bob's share, but at a rate that doesn't adequately compensate for the rapid inflation affecting Bob's potential gains. 
* **Holding Strong:** By rejecting this offer, Bob signals to Alice that he's serious about getting a larger share and won't easily concede to deals that heavily favor her. 
* **Time Pressure:** While rejecting carries risk, Bob knows that each round diminishes the value of his potential winnings. This puts pressure on Alice to offer a more substantial increase in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Bob emphasizes the time pressure by stating this is his ""final offer."" This creates a sense of urgency and might incentivize Alice to accept rather than risk further losses for Bob (and a potentially less favorable offer in round 5). 
* **Strategic Concession:** Bob is slightly increasing his previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise, but not at the cost of being severely disadvantaged by the inflation.
* **Risk Mitigation:** By increasing his offer, Bob is increasing the chances of Alice accepting. While not ideal, it's better than the decreasing value of a stalled negotiation."
