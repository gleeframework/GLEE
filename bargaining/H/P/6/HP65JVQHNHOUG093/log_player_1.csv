"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This way, we both get an equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me now, I need to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer since it's not as favorable to me as my initial proposal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 40% less for me now, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 3200, ""bob_gain"": 6800}

This way, I'm trying to maximize my share while still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast for me! Considering the offer from Bob, I think I should accept it since it's still a relatively decent split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with even lower values.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
