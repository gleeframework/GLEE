"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round, Bob. Take a small share and we can both get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not sure how much Alice is worth to me, but 100,000 is a very small share. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further devaluation of our money."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This offer is more fair than the last, and we can still both come out ahead.  Let's avoid any more inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice. The inflation is hitting Alice harder, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round. This ensures both of us get a decent share and avoids further losses due to inflation."
