"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair that I get the majority of the money since we're both taking a risk, but I'm willing to share some with you.

# Alice gain: 900000

""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic: we both lose money if this drags on. I propose a more equitable split, favoring me slightly to account for the higher inflation I face.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to receive a significant share to make this worth it for me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, the deal still heavily favors her. Accepting this offer would give me less than half the pot, even though I'm experiencing significantly higher inflation. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a better deal."
