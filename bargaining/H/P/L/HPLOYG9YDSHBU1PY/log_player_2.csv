"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to take the larger share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the 100,000, I think I can get a better deal if we go to the next round.  I'll be the one proposing then, and I can factor in the inflation rates to try and get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I propose a 45/55 split in my favor.  This takes into account the inflation rates, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's end this negotiation and get the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your proposal, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. Let's compromise at 60/40 in my favor.  This reflects the inflation, but also acknowledges that I'm willing to give some ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the previous round, I believe I can still get a more favorable deal. I'll reject this offer and wait to see what she proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to move a bit closer to your previous proposal, but I still think a 47.5/52.5 split in my favor is a fair compromise.  This accounts for the inflation and gives you a substantial share. Let's end this now and split the money.""}
