"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

This is my initial offer, which gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so my gain would be $5,400 (90% of $6,000).

I don't think this offer is fair, considering the initial proposal I made was a fair split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the fact that Bob is trying to take the majority.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less than the majority, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

This offer gives me $5,500 and Bob $4,500, with me taking a slightly smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round, so my gain would be $4,535 (73.1% of $6,200, which is 90% of $6,000).

Considering the previous offers, I think this one is still not fair, as Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the fact that Bob is still trying to take the majority.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, no more negotiations""
}
```

This offer gives us both an equal share of $5,000, which seems like a fair compromise after all the previous offers."
