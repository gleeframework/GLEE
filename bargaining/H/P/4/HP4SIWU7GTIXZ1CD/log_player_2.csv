**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, holding out a bit longer is still in Bob's best interest. Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share and becoming less flexible. By round 12, her offers might be in the range that Bob is currently rejecting. 

It's a risky game of chicken, but Bob has to project strength and hope Alice becomes more agreeable under pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I propose a fair 50/50 split to end this now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning.  While Bob still holds a theoretical advantage, the shrinking pot means every round sees significant losses. Alice is sticking to a larger share, showing she's willing to risk it. 

A 50/50 split, while not ideal at this point, is better than the risk of Alice refusing to budge and both getting nothing. It projects strength (Bob won't be lowballed) but also a willingness to compromise before it's too late."
