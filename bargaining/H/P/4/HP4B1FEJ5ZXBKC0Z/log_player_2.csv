"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. You get a quick $50,000, and I take the majority to avoid us losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be more realistic. My turn to propose: I take $800,000, and you get $200,000. This still gives you a significant sum, and it accounts for the fact that the value decreases with each round. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but your offer still undervalues the time factor.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000 for me.  That's $250,000 for you, which is still a substantial sum.  Let's not let it dwindle any further. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and the fact that the money is losing value for me, not her. While $250,000 is a lot of money, accepting an offer this low sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 60/40 split. It acknowledges the time pressure but is still a fair division. If you reject this, I'm aiming for a 50/50 split in the remaining rounds. Don't let's risk losing everything!""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This round I'm applying more pressure. By presenting it as my ""final offer"" and introducing the possibility of a 50/50 split later, I'm hoping to make Alice reconsider her strategy. She might realize that pushing for a much larger share could backfire and lead to a worse outcome for her in the end."
