"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you $60, and I'll take $40. It's better for both of us to end this now before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
