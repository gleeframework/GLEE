"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to begin with""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's be reasonable and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I'll gain in the second round is 45% of the original 100$, which is $45. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual value is $40.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
