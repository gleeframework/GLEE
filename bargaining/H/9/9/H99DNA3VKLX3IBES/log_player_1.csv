"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point, considering the risk of inflation and the possibility of future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 offer from the first round is now worth less, so I'm in a slightly weaker position. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my initial offer. However, I'd like to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take $7,000 and leave $3,000 for Bob. This is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but I'm trying to account for the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on the value of the money, and Bob's offer is now a more favorable split for him. However, I'm not willing to give up that much more. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now. Considering this, I'll aim for an even higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob. This is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer, but I'm trying to account for the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000
