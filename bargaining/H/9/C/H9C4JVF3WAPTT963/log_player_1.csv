"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm also trying to take the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60-40 split is fair, especially since I was willing to give Bob 40% in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go too far""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to take the majority of the money. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm not being too generous."
