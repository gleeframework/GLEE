"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split: 55% for me, 45% for you.  Let's be reasonable, considering the impact of inflation on future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
