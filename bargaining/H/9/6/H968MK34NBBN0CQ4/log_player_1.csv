Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm starting with a generous offer, keeping most of the money for myself but still offering Bob a decent share. I want to see if he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a lot more for me than his previous offer, it's still significantly less than what I was initially offered. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still offering Bob a considerable amount. The inflation is starting to kick in, and I need to be more strategic.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we both have a lot to lose if we keep rejecting offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hitting hard, I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm not giving up on my initial goal of getting a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to get a majority share.  The inflation is increasing the pressure, but I'm confident I can get a deal that is more favorable than Bob's current offers."
