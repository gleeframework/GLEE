Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You took a bigger risk, but inflation is on my side. This is my new offer!

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the money is worth significantly less for me due to inflation, it's better to take the offer and secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
