"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make a deal that benefits us both!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous amount considering the money's value will decrease by 20% for him in each subsequent round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money's value remains the same for me, I'll reject this offer. With each passing round, Bob's share will be worth less due to inflation, giving me more leverage to negotiate a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what opportunities arise!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation factor. Since the money's value decreases by 20% for Bob each round, his share is now worth less than in the previous rounds.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
