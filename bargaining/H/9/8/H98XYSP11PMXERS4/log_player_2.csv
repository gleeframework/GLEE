**Reasoning:** Alice is sticking very close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly. It's time to show I'm serious about getting a better deal and call her bluff. There's still a risk she'll continue to reject, but the potential reward of getting closer to a 50/50 split outweighs accepting this offer."
