Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself!  Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a more fair split. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is a compromise 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is losing value with each round, and I'm not.  This is a good compromise and I'm happy to take it."
