I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, knowing the inflation effect, I can potentially get a better deal by making a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm going for a 60-40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the inflation effect that kicks in with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not too big, considering the inflation effect! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making it riskier to continue playing. It's a good compromise."
