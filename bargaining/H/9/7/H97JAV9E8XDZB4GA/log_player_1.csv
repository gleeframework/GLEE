Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical.  I'm losing money each round we delay. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is pointless. We both lose if this drags on. Let's end this with a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob's money is losing value quickly.  While a 50/50 split isn't ideal for Alice, it's becoming increasingly attractive to Bob. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob might get desperate and offer even less.
* **Bird in the Hand:** Accepting a sure 50% is better than risking getting a smaller share later, or even reaching a stalemate where no agreement is reached."
