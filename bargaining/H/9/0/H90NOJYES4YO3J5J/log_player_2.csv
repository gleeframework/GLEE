"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start, Bob.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Besides, the money is still worth a lot, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to potentially get more. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, don't you, Alice?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to give you a little more. But let's not get greedy.  We both need to make this work! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the money is worth less now, I still think I can get a better deal. Alice is willing to give me a little more, but I'm not satisfied with 4800. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round to try to get a better offer. The difference in the effect of inflation on our gains might also play to my advantage in the long run. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a bigger share. The clock is ticking, Alice!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want more, but this is getting ridiculous.  Let's compromise before we both lose everything! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI understand Alice's concern, but I'm not ready to compromise yet. Although the money is worth significantly less now, I still think I can push for a better deal. With the increasing effect of inflation, the difference in our gains' value might become more substantial, and I might be able to use this to my advantage. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round to try to get a better offer. The pressure is on, and I'm willing to take a chance!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, Alice. I think it's time for you to reconsider and give me a bigger share. The clock is ticking!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not budging any further. We're both losing money with every round.  Let's make a deal before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The difference between our gains is substantial, but the risk of losing even more value in the next rounds is too high. I'm willing to settle for 4200, which is still a considerable amount, rather than risking getting nothing or a much lower amount in the subsequent rounds. It's time to make a deal and stop the inflation from further devaluing our potential gains!"
