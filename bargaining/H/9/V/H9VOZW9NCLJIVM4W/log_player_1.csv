"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact Bob more heavily in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an even 50/50 split. This acknowledges the inflation that has occurred, but also positions me to get a more favorable deal in future rounds if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
The inflation is now significantly affecting my gains, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor again. While inflation has been impactful, Bob is still getting a larger share of the money. I believe this is a fair offer considering the circumstances."
