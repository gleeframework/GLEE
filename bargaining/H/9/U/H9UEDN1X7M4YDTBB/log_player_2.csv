"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, but I'm confident I can get a better deal later on! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the quick cash, I'm confident I can get a better deal later in the game. It's worth the risk to see what Alice will offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I believe this is a fair starting point. Let's be reasonable and get this division done.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a better deal than your previous offer. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I still think I could get a slightly better deal, Alice's offer is fair, and it seems unlikely she will give me more.  Plus, with inflation hitting us both, it's getting riskier to keep playing."
