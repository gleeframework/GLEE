"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll give you 3/4, is that fair? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 3/4 is fair, considering I was initially looking for 60%. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll meet you in the middle at 55-45. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, hoping he'll accept this compromise."
