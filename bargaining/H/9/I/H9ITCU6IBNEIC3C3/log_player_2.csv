# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's moving in the wrong direction!  I offered a 50/50 split, and she's now trying to lowball me further.  I need to hold firm, the inflation is working against me but I'm hoping she'll crack under the pressure of the shrinking pot."

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on! With only three rounds left, and inflation eating into my potential gains, I need to make a pragmatic decision. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer of $45 is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
