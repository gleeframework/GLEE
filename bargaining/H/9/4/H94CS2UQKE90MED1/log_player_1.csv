"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

This is a classic game theory scenario, and I'm aiming to maximize my gains while also ensuring the game doesn't end prematurely.  By offering a small amount to Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is worth less each round. If I reject, I risk getting a worse offer in the next round.
* **Bob's Incentive:** Bob is clearly aiming for a larger share.  He's unlikely to offer me more in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from rejecting is outweighed by the risk of getting nothing at all."
