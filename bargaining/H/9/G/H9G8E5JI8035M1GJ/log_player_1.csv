"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the million dollars easily!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate.

I'll think carefully about this offer... 

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a large share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with further inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and let's finalize the deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be careful with my next move.

Bob's offer is slightly better than before, but I'm not sure if I want to give him such a large share.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
