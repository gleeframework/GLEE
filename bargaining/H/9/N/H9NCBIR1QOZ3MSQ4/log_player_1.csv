"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me, I'm hoping for a better deal""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, a fair deal for both of us?""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob a 50-50 split, hoping he'll accept and we can finally settle the deal."
