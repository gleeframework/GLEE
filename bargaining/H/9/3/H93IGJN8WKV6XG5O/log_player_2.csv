Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but it's still important to hold out for a better deal. The rate of inflation is increasing, meaning the later rounds offer significantly less value. It's worth risking a few more rounds to secure a larger portion of the initial sum."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's split the difference already 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The difference between Alice's offer and my previous offer is getting smaller. She's clearly feeling the pressure of the decreasing value due to inflation. Holding out for one more round might push her to accept a more favorable split.  We're getting close to the point where the difference in our positions is less significant than the loss from another round of inflation."
