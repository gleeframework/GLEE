Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is consistently trying to take a larger share, and the rate of inflation means waiting will hurt us both.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, which might push Alice to be more reasonable."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't bluff, let's make a deal 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, Alice is finally moving closer to a more even split. With the increasing inflation rate, the difference between her offer and my previous one is becoming negligible.  It's too risky to push further and risk getting nothing."
