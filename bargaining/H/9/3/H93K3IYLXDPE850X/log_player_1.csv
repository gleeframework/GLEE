"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see if Bob wants to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, $40 is equivalent to $38.6 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to two rounds of inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to be too generous""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think I'm being fair 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me due to four rounds of inflation, $35 is equivalent to $30.17 in the first round's value.

I'm not happy about the offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the significant inflation that's occurred. Since the money is worth 21.38% less for me due to five rounds of inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate.
