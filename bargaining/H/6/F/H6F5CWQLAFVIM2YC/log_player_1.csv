"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a very greedy approach in the first round. This is a risky strategy as it's very likely Bob will reject the offer and propose a more even split in the next round. However, it allows me to maximize my potential gain if Bob is willing to accept a very small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  While I was hoping to get more, Bob's offer is fair.  I don't want to risk getting nothing if we continue playing."
