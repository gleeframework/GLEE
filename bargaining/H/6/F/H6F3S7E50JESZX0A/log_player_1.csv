"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% of the money, and you get 10%. It's a fair start, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a bit more. This way, we both get a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* My gain of $600,000 is worth $540,000 (90% of $600,000)
* Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth $380,000 (95% of $400,000)

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping to get more, considering the initial offer was $900,000 and I rejected it. But I don't want to risk going to the next round and having even less value.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the effective value is $540,000.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's split it 54/46.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $540,000 and Bob gets $460,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* My gain of $500,000 is worth $363,000 (36.3% of $1,000,000)
* Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth $425,000 (42.5% of $1,000,000)

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping to get more, but the inflation is really affecting the value of the money. On the other hand, splitting it 50/50 seems like a reasonable compromise.
