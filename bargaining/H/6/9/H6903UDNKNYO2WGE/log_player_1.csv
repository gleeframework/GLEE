Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is claiming compromise, the deal is getting worse for me with every round that passes. His offer of $5500 is worth significantly less to him now than it was in the first round due to the inflation penalty.  I'm aiming to secure a larger portion of the money while it's still advantageous for him to settle."
