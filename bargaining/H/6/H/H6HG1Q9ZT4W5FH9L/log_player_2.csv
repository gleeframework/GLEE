Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to the higher inflation rate I face.

I'm proposing we split it 60/40 in my favor, reflecting the slower rate at which my money depreciates. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the inflation rates. However, your previous offer wasn't reasonable for me. This offer still leans in your favor considering the inflation difference, but is a compromise I'm willing to make to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
