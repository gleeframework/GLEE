"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob should reject this offer.  While it's a decent amount of money, he can likely do better in the future rounds. The inflation will hurt Alice more than Bob, giving him leverage to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, Bob is losing money with each round due to inflation.  Accepting this offer will guarantee him a decent amount of money, and it's likely Alice will keep demanding more in future rounds."
