{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a 40/60 split on the first round, especially since the money is going to be worth less to me in the next round. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."

I'm still rejecting. Even though the money is worth less to me, I'm hoping Alice will realize that it's better to split the money now than risk getting nothing."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a tough one.  While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, I'm still not going to cave in at this point. Alice is trying to pressure me, but I'm hoping she'll come to her senses and offer a more equitable split. It's a risky move, but I'm willing to gamble."

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting. I'm losing a lot of money, but Alice is being incredibly stubborn and refusing to budge. It's a gamble, but I believe there's still a chance she'll realize she's about to lose everything if we don't reach an agreement."

# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is incredibly frustrating! Alice is becoming increasingly unreasonable. While I'm losing a significant amount of value, I'm still going to reject this offer. I'm betting on her fear of getting nothing pushing her to make a more equitable offer in the next round. It's a risky move, but it's my last chance."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Even though I'm losing a huge amount of value due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept this unfair deal. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Alice will finally realize that it's in her best interest to settle for a more equitable split before we both get nothing."

This is it, the final round. I'm taking a huge loss, but I'm hoping Alice will realize that it's better to settle than to risk getting nothing.  I'm offering her a generous share, even with the substantial inflation cost to me."
