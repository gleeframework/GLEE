"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm offering you a decent share to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this is a decent starting offer, Bob can likely do better by waiting and seeing what Alice offers in the next round.  He has 12 rounds, and each round that passes decreases the value of the money Alice is offering him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly.  This offer gives you a majority, but I'm confident we can find a better solution for both of us later in the game.""
