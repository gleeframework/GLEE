"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, considering the current market conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value.

With Bob's offer, we'd both get $500,000, which is $900,000 in the original value. That's a decent split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $280,000 and keeping $720,000 for myself. It's a more aggressive offer, but I think it's a fair reflection of the current market conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is now worth 73.1% of its original value (1 - 0.271 = 0.731).

Considering the offer, I'd get $550,000, which is $731,000 in the original value. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.
