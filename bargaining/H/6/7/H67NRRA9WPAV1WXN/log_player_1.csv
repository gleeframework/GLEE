"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, but it's a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
