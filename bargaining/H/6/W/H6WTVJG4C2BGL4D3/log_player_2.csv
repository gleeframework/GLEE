Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, accepting now is better for both of us than letting too many rounds pass.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split in my favor is the best I can do.  Inflation is affecting us both, so let's find a solution before it gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, the deal still heavily favors her. The inflation is becoming a significant factor, but it's not yet at a point of desperation.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
