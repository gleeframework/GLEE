"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss more later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

Since the offer is a 50/50 split, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 80% of $6,250 (the value of $8,000 in the first round).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
