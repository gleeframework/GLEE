"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation means I need to get as much as possible in this first round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, 50/50 split 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though inflation has affected my potential gains, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome.  There's no guarantee I can do better in the next round, and it's likely Alice will continue to adjust her offers to reflect the changing value of the money."
