Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This back and forth is pointless. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
