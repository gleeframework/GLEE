"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This gives me a significant portion of the money upfront, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to make the game worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer is more appealing. I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
