Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and inflation is hurting my potential gains. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
