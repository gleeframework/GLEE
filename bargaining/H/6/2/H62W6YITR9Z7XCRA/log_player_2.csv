"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me starting off.  It's best to settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think I deserve the bigger share since I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  Another round and inflation will eat into the pot even more. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
