I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping they'll accept it. I'll keep the majority of the money for myself, but I want to see if they'll be willing to accept a small gain in the first round. Let's see how they respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to accept this offer. While I don't get as much money as my initial offer, I'm guaranteed to get 5000 dollars, which is a better deal than if I reject and risk getting nothing in the next round."
