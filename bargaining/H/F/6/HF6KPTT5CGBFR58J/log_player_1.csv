"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split to start. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure I want to give up 20% of my potential gain in the next round, so I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly smaller share for Bob this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. 

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I think I'll accept this offer. 3000 dollars is still a decent amount, and it's better than risking going into the next round with even less value."
