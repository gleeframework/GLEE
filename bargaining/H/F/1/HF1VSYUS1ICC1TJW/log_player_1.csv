"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that suggests fairness. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of that by offering him a significant but not equal share, hoping he'll accept early on to minimize his losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round, I think we can both do better! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because it essentially flips the original proposal I made, which he rejected. Since the money doesn't lose value for me with each round, I have no incentive to accept a deal that gives me less than what I originally proposed, especially since Bob's share is significantly larger in his proposal. I'll wait for the next round to try and negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the future value""}\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my share slightly while still offering Bob a considerable amount, taking into account that the money loses value for him with each passing round. My message suggests that Bob should consider the diminishing value of the money for him and accept this offer before it loses even more value in the next rounds. This strategy aims to put pressure on Bob to accept, knowing that his potential gain decreases over time."
