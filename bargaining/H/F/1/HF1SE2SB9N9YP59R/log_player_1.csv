"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation means accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all."
