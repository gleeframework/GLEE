"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in Round 1, so I'd actually gain $48 (60% of $80, since $100 is now worth 80% of its original value). 

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good deal considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
