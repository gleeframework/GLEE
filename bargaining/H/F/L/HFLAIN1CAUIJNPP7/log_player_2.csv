Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is suggesting a more ""middle-ground"" offer, it's important to consider the rapid inflation.  Delaying is hurting Alice more than Bob. By rejecting this offer, I'm betting Alice will be more desperate in the next round to make a deal, potentially offering a larger share to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice, literally! This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the more valuable Bob's potential gain becomes relative to Alice's.  
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She's facing a rapidly shrinking pot.
* **Slight Concession:** I've come down slightly from my previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise, but not by much. 

This offer gives Alice a reasonable, though diminished, share while still significantly benefiting Bob from the inflation dynamics."
