"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $700,000 is worth 5% less than my original gain of $900,000, which is equivalent to $855,000.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...
