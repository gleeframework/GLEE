Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go down to 55/45, but I think it's still fair considering the inflation. Let's wrap this up before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is now willing to split 55/45, he's still aiming to take the larger share. I believe I can secure a better outcome by holding out a bit longer.  The inflation is a factor, but it's impacting both of us.  It's worth the risk to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
