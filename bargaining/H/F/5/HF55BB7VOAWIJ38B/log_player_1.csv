"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is more fair, considering my willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of value. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's 60/40 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too skewed. I'm offering 58/42, a more balanced split""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
