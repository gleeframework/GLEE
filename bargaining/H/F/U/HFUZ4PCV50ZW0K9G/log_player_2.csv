Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is affecting you, Bob, but I'm also losing out on a portion of my share. Let's try to find a compromise. How about we split it 55/45, with me taking a slightly larger share? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer.  The inflation is really eating into my share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I can't go any lower than 45 for myself.  Let's end this and split it 45/55. It's the best we can do with the time we have left. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential share is actually worth due to the 20% inflation per round.  
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has slowly increased her offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in the next round. He risks ending up with even less. 

While not ideal, accepting the 55/45 split ensures Bob gets something rather than risking a worse outcome by continuing."
