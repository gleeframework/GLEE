# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer since the amount offered to me has decreased drastically, and Bob's share, although larger in percentage, is worth significantly less due to inflation. Given that this is the final round, I believe I have the upper hand in negotiations since Bob's share is worth considerably less. However, since this is the last chance for us to agree before we both get nothing, I need to consider the risk of not getting any money at all.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nHowever, since this is the last round and I must make a decision that ensures I get some money, I realize I made a mistake by not being able to propose again. Given the circumstances and the significant devaluation of Bob's share, I would have proposed a deal that is very favorable to me but still gives Bob some incentive to accept rather than lose everything. For instance, I could have proposed an 80-20 split in my favor, emphasizing that it's the last chance for us to both get something and that his share, despite being smaller, is better than nothing. But since I can only respond to Bob's offer in this final round, and considering the risk of getting nothing, I should reconsider my approach for a more favorable outcome.\n\nLet me reconsider my decision based on the final circumstances and the rules of the game.\n\nGiven the finality of the situation and the rules, my reconsidered decision, focusing purely on the response format required without further strategic elaboration, should reflect the necessity of making a choice between the offered split or the risk of both parties receiving nothing.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nThis acceptance comes with the understanding that while the split is not favorable compared to my previous proposals, the alternative of both parties receiving nothing due to the inability to come to an agreement makes this the preferable choice under the constraints of the game's final round."
