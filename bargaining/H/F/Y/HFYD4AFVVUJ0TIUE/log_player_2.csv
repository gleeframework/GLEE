Let's see what Alice offers in the next round!  I'm feeling a bit greedy, and I think I can do better than 4000."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we should both get more than last time. Let's go for a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair deal, considering the money loses value with each passing round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still aiming for a better deal. Inflation is a factor, but I think I can get more than 4200."
