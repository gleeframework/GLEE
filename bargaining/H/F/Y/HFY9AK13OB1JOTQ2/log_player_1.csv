Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I'll attach the message ""Let's be fair"" to my proposal. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both get a bigger share than last time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although I would gain $400,000, this amount is now worth 20% less due to inflation, making it effectively $320,000 in terms of the original value. I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Considering the inflation, my gain would be effectively $440,000 in terms of the original value. I'll attach the message ""Meet me in the middle"" to my proposal, hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise and accept it. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
