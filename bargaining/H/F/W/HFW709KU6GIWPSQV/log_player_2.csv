"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer seems fair on the surface, but the inflation strongly favors me in later rounds. I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more advantageous split this time. Consider the declining value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet halfway 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to recognize the impact of inflation, but this offer is still not good enough.  I need to hold out for a larger share, as the declining value heavily favors me in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer reflects the increasingly uneven impact of the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me less, I'm willing to compromise a bit 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer, acknowledging the inflation disparity. However, time is running out, and her compromise isn't significant enough yet.  I need to push for a more substantial share before we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7200, ""alice_gain"": 2800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer accounts for the shrinking pot. Let's close the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value faster, I'm being generous here 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, as the offer is still not ideal. However, with the rapidly accelerating inflation working against me, I need to make a decision. Alice is correct - I am losing value much faster. Accepting a less-than-ideal split is better than risking a total loss if we run out of rounds."
