"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. This is a 25% share for Bob, which I think is a generous offer considering the potential for further negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased, but I still need to make the most of it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
