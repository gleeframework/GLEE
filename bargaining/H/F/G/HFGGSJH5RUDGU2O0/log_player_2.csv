"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This might seem like a decent offer at first, but the inflation heavily favors me. I need to aim for a much larger share in the early rounds to make up for the rapid devaluation of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I understand the need to be fair, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. I'm proposing a larger share for me this round to compensate. We can adjust in later rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but let's keep it reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but this offer is still unacceptable. Even with a slightly larger share, the rapid inflation means I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential value with each round that passes. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast. I'm willing to adjust my previous proposal slightly, but we need to reach an agreement soon.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, let's meet closer to the middle before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting the message that waiting is risky, but this offer is still not good enough.  The longer we wait, the more leverage I lose due to the unequal inflation. I need to hold strong and push for a more favorable split while it's still possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise to account for the dwindling value.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something.""
