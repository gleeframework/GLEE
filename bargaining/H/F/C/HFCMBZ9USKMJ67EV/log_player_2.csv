"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob, considering the risk and uncertainty of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is generous, it's crucial to consider the potential for inflation.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Alice,  rejecting and proposing a different split allows for potential negotiation and a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
