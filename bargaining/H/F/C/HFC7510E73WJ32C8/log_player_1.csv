"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer. I'll take nearly everything, leaving Bob with just $1. This is to see how much he's willing to risk and how much he values fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the end."
