Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting point heavily favors you.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation impacting me at twice your rate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
