"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bit less than half, hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself this time.  Let's avoid letting inflation eat away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}

I'm hoping that by offering a compromise, we can settle on a mutually acceptable split before the inflation eats away too much of the value."
