"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see if we can improve on that.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and hoping Bob will accept or propose a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly lower share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking for a good deal. Bob's offer is a bit low, but I don't want to give up too much.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is the highest I can go without giving away too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking for a good deal. Bob's offer is a bit lower than my previous offer, and considering the inflation, I think I should get a bit more.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can we try to find a compromise?""
}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth much less. I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I've been generous enough. Let's finalize this!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit closer to my desired share, while also being mindful of the fact that Bob's offer was generous in the previous round. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to him."
