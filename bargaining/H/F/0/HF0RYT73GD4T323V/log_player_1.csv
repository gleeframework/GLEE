"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value, my gain would be 56 dollars, but the offer is to split it 50-50, so I'd get 50 dollars.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
