Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money almost evenly.  This ensures we both get a fair share, and I can get a bit more since my money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
