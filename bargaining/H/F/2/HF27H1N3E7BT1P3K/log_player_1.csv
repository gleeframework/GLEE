"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, as it seems fair given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me.

I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""A 50/50 split is too generous for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a slightly biased split in my favor.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $300,000, but I need to protect my interests in this inflationary environment. I'm keeping $700,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal for myself, considering the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rate, I propose a 45/55 split, aiming for a balance between fairness and personal gain. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'm not sure if I can do better, and a 45/55 split seems reasonable given the circumstances.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""A 45/55 split is a fair compromise, considering the inflation. I'll accept your offer.""
}
```"
