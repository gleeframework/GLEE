Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split fairly, 60% for me since I'm losing value each round 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice, meet me in the middle. I'm losing value fast! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and his offers are slowly getting better for me. While he's focused on the immediate loss from inflation, I can hold out for a slightly better deal. It's risky, but the potential reward is higher."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. It's my last offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He's had two rounds to see that I'm willing to play hardball. Offering a slight increase from my Round 3 offer might entice him while still securing a good share for myself. The threat of a ""last offer"" adds urgency."
