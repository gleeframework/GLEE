"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'll start by offering a 9000/1000 split in my favor. It's a bit aggressive, but I figure it'll give Bob something to think about. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and better than getting stuck in a potential endless loop of rejections. I'll take it!"
