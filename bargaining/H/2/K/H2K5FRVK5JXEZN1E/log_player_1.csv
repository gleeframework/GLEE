""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit biased. How about we split it 55-45? It's still a good deal for you, and we should try to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I understand the pressure of the inflation, but Bob's offer is still not beneficial for me in the long run.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'll take 58 and you can have 42. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tight! Bob is pushing his luck, but accepting now might be better than risking getting even less later.
