  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly. Let's end the game now!""
}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share of the money!

After considering his offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $3,000, which is a 50% decrease from my initial offer of $6,000. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more modest proposal that takes into account the inflation. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This is a fair offer considering the inflation.""

After considering his offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
