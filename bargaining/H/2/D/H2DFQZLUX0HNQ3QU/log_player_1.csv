"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a little more for taking the risk.  How about 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split, which is closer to 50/50 but still gives me a slightly better share.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split.""}"
