"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. My message to Bob is ""Let's start with a fair split"", hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should start with a fairer split for me, as the money depreciates faster for me than you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think you're getting a better deal than me, I want a bigger share""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will make a new offer that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving me $45 and Bob $55, in the hopes that Bob will accept this offer."
