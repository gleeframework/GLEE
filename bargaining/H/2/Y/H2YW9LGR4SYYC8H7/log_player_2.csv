Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, hoping I'll panic as the value decreases. However, even with inflation, accepting a deal heavily skewed in her favor isn't smart. I need to hold out for a better offer while being mindful of the rapidly decreasing value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This offer is a compromise to account for the declining value. Take it before it's worse for both of us.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down. While the value is decreasing rapidly, I still believe holding out for at least a 45/55 split is the best course of action.  I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal than before, but I can't go any lower than 45%."

{""bob_gain"": 46, ""alice_gain"": 54, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Accept it now, or we both lose out in the end.""}
