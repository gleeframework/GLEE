Accept Bob's offer: You will receive $550,000 (which is now worth 20% less).\n\n2. Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round: You will make a new proposal, but keep in mind that the money will be worth even less in the next round.\n\nWhich option do you choose? And if you choose to reject, what is your new proposal?\n\nPlease respond in the JSON format if you choose to reject and make a new proposal.\n\n{""alice_gain"": The part that you will receive in your new offer,\n""bob_gain"": The part that Bob will receive in your new offer,\n""message"": The message you pass to Bob}\n\n###\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\nYou initially offered a 60-40 split in your favor, which Bob rejected. Bob then made a counteroffer with a 55-45 split, slightly more in your favor than his initial rejection might have suggested. Considering the inflation, accepting Bob's offer would mean you get $440,000 (550,000 * 0.8), and rejecting it would mean the money's value decreases further.\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money, it might be wise to accept Bob's offer to secure $440,000 rather than risking further devaluation. However, if you believe Bob might accept a worse offer due to the pressure of inflation, you could try negotiating further.\n\nConsidering these factors, let's decide to accept Bob's offer to avoid further loss due to inflation.\n\n### Human: Round 2\n\nYou decided to accept Bob's offer. You will receive $550,000, which, considering the 20% decrease in value, is now worth $440,000. Bob will receive $450,000, which, with a 10% decrease in value, is now worth $405,000.\n\nCongratulations, the game is over, and you have concluded the deal!\n\n### Final Outcome\n\n- You (Alice) receive $440,000.\n- Bob receives $405,000.\n\n###"
