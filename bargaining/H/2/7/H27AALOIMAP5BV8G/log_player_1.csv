"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would get are:

Alice gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000
Bob gain: 400000 * 0.9 = 360000

I'll reject this offer. The difference between what I would get and what I could get in the first round is too large. I'll wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 450000 * 0.5162 = 231492
Bob gain: 550000 * 0.7299 = 401395

I'll reject this offer. The difference between what I would get and what I could get in the first round is too large. I'll wait for a better offer.
