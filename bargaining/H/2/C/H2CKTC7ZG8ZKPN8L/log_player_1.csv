"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 4:1 ratio. This might seem like a generous offer considering the inflation rate, but remember, with each round, the value of your share decreases.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, let's try to find a compromise. I'm offering a 1:1 split. The value of the money will decrease with each round, so it's better to divide it now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
