Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this more evenly. We're both losing value with each round, so let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to a more even split, which is good, but he's still benefiting significantly more from the deal due to the impact of inflation on my gains.  While time is running out, I need to hold out for a better offer to make up for the devaluation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. We need to close this deal now, or we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Time is running out, and with each round, the potential gains for both of us diminish.  It's crucial to emphasize that a deal needs to be struck *now*.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've slightly lowered my ask to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the offer still leans in my favor to compensate for the inflation working against me. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob into accepting. He's been steadily increasing his share in each offer, so this might be his last chance to secure a larger portion than a potential 50/50 split in later rounds."
