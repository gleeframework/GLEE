"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, I need to think carefully. My gain of 40 is worth 20% less than the 50 I proposed in the first round, so it's a bit less than I initially wanted. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 60 is worth 10% less than his original share, which is a better deal for me.

I'll accept this offer.
