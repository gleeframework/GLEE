"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! 60-40 split is fair.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're going to regret rejecting my 60-40 offer! Now I'm offering 70-30 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject this offer. His gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, but his share is still too big. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! 55-45 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still leaning towards a slightly higher share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go any further 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is looking pretty tempting, but I'm not sure I want to give up too much. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, but it's still a substantial amount.

I'll reject this offer, but I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to be fair, Bob. 50-50 split is the only way to go.""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise."
