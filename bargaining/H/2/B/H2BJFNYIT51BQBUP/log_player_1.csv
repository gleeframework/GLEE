Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm hoping to get the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give him a little to avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept this offer. It's incredibly unfair, and while the inflation is a factor, I'm still in a strong position to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see reason and come to a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  I'm taking into account the inflation, but I believe a 60/40 split is still fair given the circumstances."
