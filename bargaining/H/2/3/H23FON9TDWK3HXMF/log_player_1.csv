"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving Bob with $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my initial $6,000 would be worth $4,800 in this round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than taking $2,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my initial $4,800 would be worth $3,840 in this round.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the remaining $10,000, which is $4,500, and leaving Bob with $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my initial $4,800 would be worth approximately $2,500 in this round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $1,000. However, it's a significant decrease from my initial offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
