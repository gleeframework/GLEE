"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, but the inflation heavily favors me. It's better to wait for Alice's share to decrease significantly in value before accepting or proposing a counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but this split accounts for the decreasing value over time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally acknowledging the inflation, but she's still getting the better end of the deal in the long run. I need to hold out for a more significant shift in the proportions."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  Let's be realistic about what these amounts are actually worth.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer split 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers still favor her significantly, even with the decreased value. I need to stand firm. We're getting close to the point where the actual difference between our offers will be negligible due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's time to cut my losses. 

While this isn't ideal, the inflation means my potential gains are dwindling rapidly. Accepting Alice's offer now gives me $4600 which, while hit by inflation, is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to haggle. 

The difference between our offers is becoming less significant with each round due to the shrinking value.  It's no longer worth the risk of walking away empty-handed."
