"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a quick and easy split. This also leaves room for me to adjust my offer if he's greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I know the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to slightly lower my share but still offer him a decent amount to try and incentivize him to accept. I know inflation is hurting my potential gains, so I need to be assertive but not overly greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to cave to his demands. I'm still in a strong position since I'm the one making the next offer, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still offering Bob a significant amount. I'm trying to strike a balance between being fair and securing a good deal for myself. With each round, inflation is eating away at our potential gains, so I need to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair. The inflation is making the money worth less with each round, but I'm not going to accept a deal where I'm getting significantly less than I could. I need to stay strong and negotiate for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm also getting closer to the halfway mark. I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money. I'm running out of time, so I need to find a solution soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, this is a fair deal considering the inflation rate and the limited time remaining. Accepting this offer ensures that I will receive some money, whereas rejecting it might lead to both of us getting nothing."
