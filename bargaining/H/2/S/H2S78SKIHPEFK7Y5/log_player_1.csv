"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but it's still a good deal for you too!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30% offer, but considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to give me a slightly bigger share, I'll accept his offer.
