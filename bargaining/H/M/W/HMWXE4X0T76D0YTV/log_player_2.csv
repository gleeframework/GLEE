"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%, it's a good start! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I think I can get a better deal, let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45. It's a more equitable starting point, and we can adjust from there.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 60/40 seems more balanced, given the inflation factor. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  The inflation factor is a risk, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in future rounds."
