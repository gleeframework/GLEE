"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet in the middle, huh?

I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, considering the inflation. If I accept, I'll be getting $5000, but it's worth 20% less than the $6000 I proposed in the first round. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 5% less than his initial $4000, but it's still a decent amount.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer for now. I want to see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Still a bit off, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, trying to account for the inflation. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting hard!

Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer. If I accept, I'll be getting $4800, which is worth 48.8% less than the $6000 I proposed in the first round. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $5200 is worth 14.26% less than his initial $4000, but it's a bit more than his previous offer.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I want to see if I can do better.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the middle, but I'm still holding firm!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 52-48 in my favor, trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Let's analyze Bob's offer. If I accept, I'll be getting $4600, which is worth 67.23% less than the $6000 I proposed in the first round. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $5400 is worth 22.62% less than his initial $4000, which is a relatively small reduction.

Considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'm starting to feel a bit desperate. I don't want to leave too much on the table, but I also don't want to give Bob too much. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll accept this offer.
