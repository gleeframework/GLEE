"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject the offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 10% inflation from the previous round, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. Since I want to maximize my gain, I'll offer a smaller amount to Bob to make the deal more attractive to him.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the cumulative inflation effect, my gain is now worth 72.9% of its original value (90% * 0.9). I'll need to reassess the offer from Bob.

Since the offer from Bob is the same as in Round 2, and my gain is worth less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
