Round 2

Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 52-48 was your final offer, but I'll give you one more chance. 57-43 is my counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. Accepting 43 now would be significantly less valuable than a better split in a later round, even with the continued inflation.  I need to hold my ground a bit longer to try and get Alice to offer a more reasonable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of inflation. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}
