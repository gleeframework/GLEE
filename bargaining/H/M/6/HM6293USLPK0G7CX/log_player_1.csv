"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is actually the same as mine in the first round, but with the money being worth 10% less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer since it's the same as the one I made in the first round, and I'm hoping for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth 20% less than the initial amount, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $800,000 (1,000,000 - 20% due to inflation), leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to the same ratio as before, but with the money being worth 27.1% less than the initial amount.

I'll accept this offer since it's a slightly better deal for me than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with the money being worth even less.
