"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent chunk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

In this round, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3200 (80% of the original value). This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to two rounds of 20% inflation), I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the reduced value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering to take 55% of the $10,000, which is worth $4,500 in real terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! 

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the original $10,000, my gain of $2500 is actually worth only $1,280 (26.4% of the original value). I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.
