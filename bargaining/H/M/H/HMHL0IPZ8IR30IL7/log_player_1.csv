I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to get Bob to accept quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My gains are worth less each round, and I don't know how much Bob's gains are affected. Accepting now means I get a guaranteed share.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  If I reject, Bob will propose again, and I could end up with less in the next round due to inflation. 

It's better to secure a decent gain than risk getting nothing."
