"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% reduction in value, my potential gain is now worth $45 (40 * 0.9).

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it. For now, I'll reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again! Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 10% less than the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll calculate it: $42 * 0.723 (1 - 0.277) = $30.36. Not great, but I'll consider it.

I'm not thrilled about the 42-58 split, but I'll think it's the best I can get at this point. I'll accept the offer.
