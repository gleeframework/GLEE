"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's make a deal, Alice. I'll take a bit more, you take a bit less. Time is money, after all.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. We both still get a decent amount, and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, this offer is more than fair considering the time pressure.  I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need you to meet me halfway.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to close this deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming severe. While it's not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $60 is better than risking getting nothing if the game continues."
