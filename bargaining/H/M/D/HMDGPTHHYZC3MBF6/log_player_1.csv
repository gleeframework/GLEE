"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I propose taking 65% and you take 35%.  Think about the long game - this deal gets worse for both of us the longer we wait.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:**  A 65/35 split is significantly in Alice's favor, but not outrageously so. It establishes a strong starting position.
* **Emphasis on Time Sensitivity:**  Highlighting the rapid depreciation of the money due to inflation puts pressure on Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later. This plays to Alice's advantage, as her money loses value faster.
* **Future Negotiation Implied:** The phrase ""Let's start"" implies there's room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer. This can make Bob more likely to counter-propose rather than simply rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better, Alice. This offer gives you a bigger share than the previous one, but I'm willing to be flexible if you're open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Shift:** While Bob claims Alice's share is bigger, the actual amounts show a significant shift in his favor. Even with inflation, this offer is much worse for Alice than her initial proposal.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** Bob's message aims to sound conciliatory but is deceptive. His flexibility comment is likely a ploy to get Alice to negotiate from a weaker position.
* **Leveraging Time:** Alice's money is devaluing faster than Bob's. By rejecting this offer, she increases the pressure on Bob to make a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is literally money here, and it's disappearing faster for me.  My new offer is 55/45. It's better for you than my last offer after factoring in inflation, and it avoids us dragging this out any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Alice reduces her demand slightly from 65% to 55%, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable split.
* **Inflation Emphasis:** Alice again reminds Bob that time is of the essence, subtly implying that her offer is generous considering the rapid devaluation.
* **Clear Calculation:** By explicitly mentioning that her offer is better for Bob than her previous one after accounting for inflation, she demonstrates her understanding of the game's mechanics and strengthens her position. 
* **Urgency:** The language ""Let's be realistic"" and ""avoid dragging this out"" injects a sense of urgency, pushing Bob towards a decision."
