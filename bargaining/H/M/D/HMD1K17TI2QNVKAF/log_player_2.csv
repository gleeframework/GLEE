Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, a little more 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting better, time is running out *fast*.  Alice is clearly trying to wear Bob down, banking on him getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into his potential gains. Bob needs to hold his nerve a little longer and push for a more favorable outcome in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice! Take this offer, or the deal's off.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference, last chance 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The writing is on the wall. Alice is unlikely to offer anything better, and Bob's position is getting worse with every passing round due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets something, while rejecting it risks getting nothing at all if Alice continues with her current strategy."
