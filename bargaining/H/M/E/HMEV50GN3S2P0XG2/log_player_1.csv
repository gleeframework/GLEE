"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I would receive $60 and Bob would receive $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the risk of inflation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the 60/40 split. However, I still think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55 is still a bit too much. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for Bob, but still gives me a decent chunk of the money."
