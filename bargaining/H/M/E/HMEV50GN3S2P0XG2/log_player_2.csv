"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's ""fair"" in the sense of being a simple split, I want to see if I can get a better deal. The risk of inflation is real, so I'll push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the risk of inflation. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55 is still a bit too much. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and the inflation has impacted her more than me.  A 55/45 split is a good outcome, and it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
