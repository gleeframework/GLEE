"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money (900,000$) while still leaving Bob with a decent amount (100,000$).  I believe this is a fair starting point.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  While he's taken a larger share, I'm only getting 200,000, which is a substantial drop from my previous 900,000.  I'll reject this offer and see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

Since Bob rejected my initial offer and then offered me a significantly lower amount, I'm going to propose a more balanced split. This offer gives me a majority of the money, but it's still a significant reduction from my first offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. Let's see if Bob accepts this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, even with inflation factored in. I'm losing a significant portion of the money, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I've had enough of these back-and-forth rejections!  I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option considering the inflation we're facing. It's time to end this negotiation and get something before the value of the money plummets further!"
