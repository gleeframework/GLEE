It's a good offer, but I'm confident I can do better. I'm going to see if I can get a larger share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm going to take a slightly larger share, hoping Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's less than what I initially wanted, inflation is starting to hit hard, and I don't want to risk losing even more."
