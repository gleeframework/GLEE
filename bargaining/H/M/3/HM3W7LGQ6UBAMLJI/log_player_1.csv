I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but I figure Bob might be willing to take a small share rather than risk getting nothing if we go to the next round and inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1000, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Inflation is working against me, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced offer this time. Bob's rejection of my previous offer shows he's also trying to secure a good share. I'm reducing my share to 4500, which is still more than what he offered in round 2. I'm hoping this compromise will make him more likely to accept."
