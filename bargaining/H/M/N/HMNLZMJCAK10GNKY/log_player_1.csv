Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars and let Bob take 1 dollar.  This might seem unfair, but remember, the money will be worth 5% less in the next round if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
