"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in a 60-40 split and we can wrap this up quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up on a bigger share just yet, especially since the inflation is only affecting me!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share""
}


Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to give up some of my gain to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to accept, considering the inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my share. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise at this point!"
