"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($9,000), but still offers Bob a small portion ($1,000). I hope this is enticing enough for him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation means my share is worth less each round. This offer is a fair split and ensures I get something while the value of my share isn't diminishing further."
