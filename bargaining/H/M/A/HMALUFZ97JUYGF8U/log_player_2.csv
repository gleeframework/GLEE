This is frustrating, but I can't accept an offer where I'm consistently getting less, especially with the inflation working against me. I need to show I'm serious about getting a better deal."

# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit less than before, but not much 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56

This is getting too risky. The inflation is eating into my potential gains, and Alice is clearly holding out for as much as possible. Better to take a smaller amount now than risk getting nothing in the end."
