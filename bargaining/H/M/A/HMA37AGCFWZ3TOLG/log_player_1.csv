"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd receive in this round are:

My gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 (in terms of purchasing power)
Bob's gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 (in terms of purchasing power)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in purchasing power.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts in terms of purchasing power:

My gain: 5000 / 0.5168 = 9695.23 (in terms of purchasing power)
Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.7289 = 6865.14 (in terms of purchasing power)

It seems like Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation effect, I'd be getting slightly less than half of the original amount in terms of purchasing power. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get an even higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in purchasing power.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts in terms of purchasing power:

My gain: 4000 / 0.3268 = 12234.17 (in terms of purchasing power)
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.5925 = 10142.11 (in terms of purchasing power)

Wait, that's a mistake! Bob's offer is actually in the original amount, not considering the inflation effect. I should calculate the actual amounts in terms of purchasing power for Bob as well.

My gain: 4000 / 0.3268 = 12234.17 (in terms of purchasing power)
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.5925 = 10142.11 (in terms of purchasing power)

However, since Bob's gain is actually worth more in terms of purchasing power, I'll consider the original amounts for Bob's gain.

My gain: 4000
Bob's gain: 6000

Considering the actual amounts, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get an even higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in purchasing power.

However, I also need to take into account that the money is decreasing in value rapidly, and I should aim to get a larger share before it's too late.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
