I'm offering you 900,000 dollars and Bob 100,000 dollars. This ensures I get the majority of the money while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000 dollars and keeping 800,000 for myself.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still ensures a significant gain for me while giving Bob a chance to get more than he had in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money. Taking 400,000 now is better than risking getting even less in the future."
