"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This offer is very unequal.  Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 
Let's start with a more fair split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is still not ideal, considering inflation, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
