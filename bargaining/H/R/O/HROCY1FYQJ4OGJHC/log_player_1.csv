"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. You can consider it a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. With the 10% decrease in value, my gain of 60 would be equivalent to 54 in the first round, and Bob's gain of 40 would be equivalent to 38. This is a slightly better deal than my initial proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increased inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round.""
}
```

I'm aiming to get a bit more than the 54 I would have gotten in the first round, considering the inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. Let's see if we can make a deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the 27.1% decrease in value, my gain of 50 would be equivalent to 36.73 in the first round, which is a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I should accept a 50/50 split, especially since I was hoping to get a slightly better deal.

I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer.
