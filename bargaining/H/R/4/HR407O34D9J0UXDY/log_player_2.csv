"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it might seem like a decent starting point, the inflation works heavily in my favor as Bob. Alice needs to agree to a much smaller share for herself if she wants to maximize her potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""My turn! Let's be realistic, I'm feeling generous with this offer considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more than fair offer. Don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still heavily overestimating her bargaining position given the rapid devaluation of her share. While she's acknowledging the inflation, her proposed split doesn't reflect the reality of how much she stands to lose. I need to hold firm and wait for a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and your share is shrinking fast. I'm offering you a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing. Come on, Bob, meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally understanding the urgency, but this offer is still unacceptable. While she's talking about meeting halfway, the split doesn't reflect that.  I need to hold my ground a little longer and hope she gets realistic soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7200, ""alice_gain"": 2800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a good deal for both of us. Don't let time run out and leave us with nothing!""}
