"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation. While her offer is presented as more ""reasonable"", it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split, even if it means going a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic. Let's end this with a deal that works for both of us. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Round 2 to show flexibility, but I'm also drawing a line in the sand.  The ""final offer"" message adds pressure, hoping Alice will realize a decent share now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
