"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a division of $99 for me and $1 for Bob.  This way, I get the majority of the money, and Bob still gets something.  Hopefully, he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. This offer still gives me a significant share while giving Bob a slightly larger piece than before.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in taking this deal rather than risking further rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting Bob harder than me. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount of money, and it's likely Bob won't get a better deal in the next round due to inflation. It's time to cut my losses and secure the win."
