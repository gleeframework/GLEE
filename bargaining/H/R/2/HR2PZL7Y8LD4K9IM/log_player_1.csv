Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the devaluation, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is fairer given the current round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
