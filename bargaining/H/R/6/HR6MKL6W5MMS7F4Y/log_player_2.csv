Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a 60/40 split.  This is fair, and we should both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to budge a little, but I still think I deserve the majority. This is a good deal for both of us before inflation hits too hard.  Let's call it a day!

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're getting closer to the end. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but I'm not going lower than 70/30. This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's not let the money disappear! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is finally moving closer to a more even split, accepting 30% when time is running out would be a mistake.  We've shown we're willing to negotiate but accepting a significantly smaller share isn't in our best interest yet. The pressure from inflation is on both of us now."
