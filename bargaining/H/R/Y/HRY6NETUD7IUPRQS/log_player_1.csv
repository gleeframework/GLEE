"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my gain accordingly. Since Bob's offer is 400,000 for me, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round, taking into account the 5% decrease in value.

400,000 / 0.95 = 42105.26 (approximately)

This is less than my initial offer of 500,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 5% decrease in value for me.

Since the money is worth 95% of its original value, I'll offer a slightly higher share to account for the decrease.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round, taking into account the inflation effects.

Alice's gain: 450,000 / 0.8526 (1 - 0.1474) = 527,511.45 (approximately)
Bob's gain: 550,000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = 1063,333.33 (approximately)

Since Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, but with a higher value in the first round, I'll accept his offer.
