"Round 1
Alice's offer:

""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This deal still gives you a significant amount, Bob, but acknowledges the time pressure we're both under. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting closer to something more acceptable, Alice is still trying to capitalize on my larger depreciation rate. I need to show I'm willing to wait for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and we both lose with every round. This is my final offer for a reasonable split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Resolve:**  I need to demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a larger share and won't simply cave to time pressure. 
* **Finality:** Presenting this as my ""final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and might push Alice to accept rather than risk further depreciation.
* **Slight Concession:** While still favoring me, a 47.5/52.5 split is a small move towards Alice's previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise but only up to a point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair compromise. We need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value. Let's be sensible. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her Round 2 offer, which was already borderline acceptable. Given the increasing inflation, holding out for a significantly better deal is too risky. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount, even if it's not my ideal split."
