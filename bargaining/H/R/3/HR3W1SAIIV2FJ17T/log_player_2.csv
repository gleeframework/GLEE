"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous. Accept this and we can both move on with our lives.  
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, Bob knows that by rejecting, he can get a better deal in the next round. The 5% inflation will make Alice's offer less valuable in the next round, giving Bob more leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more equitable split. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not happy with the last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob would prefer a higher share, the 9.75% inflation makes this offer a much more appealing deal than the previous round. Accepting this will get him a significant share of the money, and it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice in the future."
