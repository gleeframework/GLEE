Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.  This is a better deal for me, knowing the money loses value each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
