"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, Alice. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is a bit better than my last one, but waiting is risky.  I need to consider that the value decreases.
