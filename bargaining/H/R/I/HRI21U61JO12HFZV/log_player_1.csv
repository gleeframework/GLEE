"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60, you get 40. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the value of the money decreases each round.  Let's go with 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 45 is a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, and 40% less than in round 1, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70, you get 30. The value of money is dropping fast, I need to get my share while I can!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be reasonable here. The money is losing value quickly, but we both need to get something. I'm willing to offer 60/40, which is closer to a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is dropping rapidly, and I need to think carefully about this offer.

However, I think 40 is a bit too low for me, considering the initial offer I made in round 1 was 60. I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping it will be more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, the money is almost worthless! I'll take 80, you get 20. It's now or never!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the money is losing value drastically.  We need to settle on something before it's all gone! I'm willing to go up to 70/30. It's a good deal for both of us at this point. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting, and I'm getting desperate. 30 is a very low offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. Considering the rapid inflation, I think I'll accept Bob's offer from round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing."
