"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take a thousand and let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000 is something, it's a very small share of the total pie.  Since there are 12 rounds and the money depreciates by 20% each round, I can likely get a much better deal by rejecting and waiting to make my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split this 60/40, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we can get this over with quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm dropping my share, but I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering more than she did in round 1, the inflation has made the money significantly less valuable. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal than 3000, especially since we have 9 rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  We both know this money is depreciating fast.  Let's split it evenly and move on.  We can both benefit from a quick resolution.""}
