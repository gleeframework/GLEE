"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep almost all the money for myself, giving Bob only $1. This is a very aggressive opening move, aiming to see if Bob is willing to play along with a highly unequal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair offer, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
