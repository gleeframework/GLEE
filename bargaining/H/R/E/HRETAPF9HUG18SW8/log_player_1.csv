"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $6,000 x 0.9 = $5,400 (10% less than the original $6,000)
* Bob's gain: $4,000 x 0.95 = $3,800 (5% less than the original $4,000)

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll evaluate it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, considering the inflation hit. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation adjustments, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55% this time, considering the inflation. Your turn to decide!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach, considering the inflation. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the new inflation adjustments, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $6,000 x 0.723 (1 - 0.277 or 27.1% less) = $4,338
* Bob's gain: $4,000 x 0.858 (1 - 0.1426 or 14.26% less) = $3,432

Given the adjusted amounts, I'll evaluate Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""It's a good compromise, considering the inflation. I'll take the deal!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally settle on a division of the $10,000."
