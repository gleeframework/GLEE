I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I figure I'll get a good chunk of the money, but I'm not being overly greedy in the first round.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"

Bob is trying to be too clever!  He's trying to take advantage of inflation to get a much larger share. I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to reject this offer and make my own counter-proposal in the next round."

I'm getting more and more impatient with Bob!  He's clearly trying to use the inflation to his advantage, but I'm not going to let him.  This time, I'm offering him a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a decent chunk of the money.  I'm hoping he'll finally see reason and accept this offer.  We're running out of time."

We're nearing the end of the game and Bob still seems determined to be stubborn. I'm going to try offering a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'm hoping he'll finally realize that he's not going to get any more than that."
