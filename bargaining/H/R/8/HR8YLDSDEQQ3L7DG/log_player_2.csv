{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn.  Let's be practical. I'm rejecting your previous offer because it heavily favored you. This offer still gives you a good share while accounting for the impact of inflation on both our ends.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting you harder than me. Let's be smart and settle this now. This offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we drag this out, the less we both gain. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point.""}
