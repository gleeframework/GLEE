Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with a 50/50 split, especially since I'm getting less than the initial proposal and Bob is gaining. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial offer, but still significantly more than the 50/50 split. Hopefully, he'll see that it's in his best interest to take this offer before inflation reduces his share even further."
