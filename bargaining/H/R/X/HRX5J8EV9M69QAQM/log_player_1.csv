"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'd like to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
