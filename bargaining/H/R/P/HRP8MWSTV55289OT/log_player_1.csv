Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me almost all the money, but it's a good starting point. Let's see if Bob is greedy or reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get now. Inflation is a real threat, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
