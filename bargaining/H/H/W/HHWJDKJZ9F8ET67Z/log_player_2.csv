"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. But I still believe we can find a more equitable solution.  Let's try this: I'll take a bit less, and you can take more, but let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising a bit, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid depreciation of her share.  It's worth risking another round to see if we can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the value is decreasing rapidly.  My offer is still a slight advantage for you considering the depreciation, but it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value diminishes significantly, especially for Alice.  This puts pressure on her to make a deal sooner. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  By highlighting the fairness of the offer considering the depreciation, I'm appealing to Alice's sense of reason and urging a swift resolution. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my share from the previous offer to signal a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a favorable outcome given the circumstances."
