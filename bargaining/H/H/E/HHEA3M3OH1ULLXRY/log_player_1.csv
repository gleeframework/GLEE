Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a good starting point, as it's a fairly generous offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing. With the inflation, the money is worth less each round, and there's a risk that Bob will continue to be greedy and I'll end up with nothing. Accepting this offer at least secures me a decent amount of money."
