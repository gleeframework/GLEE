# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle, I've lowered my expectations 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest.  Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 50/50 is fair, but I've waited longer, so I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, accepting Alice's offer at this stage would still be worse than getting nothing at all.  I'm banking on her fear of both of us losing out pushing her towards a more equitable split in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out!  I'm making a concession, but this really is my bottom line.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly increasing my offer to show some flexibility, but I need to convey a sense of urgency. Alice needs to understand that time is running out for both of us, and my offer is unlikely to get any better."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and my patience is wearing thin. Take this or risk getting nothing 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation has eroded the value of my potential gains significantly. Accepting Alice's offer, while far from ideal, is now the most logical choice. Holding out any longer carries the substantial risk of walking away with nothing at all."
