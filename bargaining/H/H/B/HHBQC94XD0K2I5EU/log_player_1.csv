I propose taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just a single dollar. It's a risky move, but I want to see if he'll accept such an unequal split in the first round.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is clearly trying to use the same strategy as me in the first round. I'll reject his offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the inflation we're facing.  I hope Bob will accept it and we can both walk away with a significant amount of money."
