"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 95% of the initial $600,000 I proposed in round 1. That's a significant reduction.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a larger share for Bob against the risk of not getting a better deal in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'll get 42% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze the new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 75% of the initial $600,000 I proposed in round 1. That's a bit better than the $300,000 I would have gotten in round 2.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth taking a slightly better deal now or waiting for a potentially better offer in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This way, I'll get 48% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 52%."
