Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation will hurt me. I need to push for a more equitable split soon, or I risk getting a much worse deal later."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at this deal. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This recognizes the impact of inflation on my end while still offering you a significant amount."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Time is running out, and each round makes the potential winnings less valuable, especially for me. 
* **Fairness:** While I'm pushing for a larger share, it's important to frame it as a reasonable compromise that recognizes the inflation disparity. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly increasing my offer from the previous round to signal a willingness to negotiate, hoping Alice will be more receptive to a deal before the money shrinks further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the urgency, but I still think my share should be higher. Meeting in the middle won't work for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the clock is ticking, and Alice clearly isn't budging much.  Here's why accepting is the less risky option at this point:

* **Significant Inflation:**  We're at round 5 of 12, and the inflation is hitting me hard. Accepting now still gets me a significant sum, even if it's not ideal. Waiting longer risks getting even less later.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message suggests she's not going to agree to anything close to a 50/50 split. Further rejections might lead to her offering even less favorable terms.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better deal is tempting, but it's a gamble. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. Taking the guaranteed $450,000 now is a safer bet than hoping for a slightly larger, but uncertain, amount later."
