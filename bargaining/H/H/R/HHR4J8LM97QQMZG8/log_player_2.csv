"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation affects us both, but I'm willing to find a middle ground. This is a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I decide to accept for the following reasons:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting longer means we both get less in real terms.
* **Alice's Offer Shift:** Alice has moved closer to a more even split, acknowledging the impact of inflation on both sides. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is very risky given the rapid inflation. Accepting a reasonable offer now guarantees a decent amount.
