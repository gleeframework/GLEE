Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split this evenly.  The inflation is going to hurt us both if we wait any longer.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, my offer is still better than the last one 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but time is working against me more than her. However, accepting $43 after inflation is a terrible deal.  I need to signal I'm willing to accept a less extreme split, but not a terrible one. There's a chance she'll offer something better in the next round rather than risk getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice. I'm losing value quickly with this inflation. Let's close this deal before it gets worse.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous considering the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't great, it's marginally better than her last one, and the difference between this and a potentially worse offer in later rounds isn't worth the risk of getting $0."
