Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  Let's stop wasting time with inflation eating away at our potential gains. I propose a 50/50 split - a fair and simple solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
