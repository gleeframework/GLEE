"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** By rejecting Alice's offer, I've taken control of the negotiation. This puts me in a stronger position.
* **Finality:**  Stating ""this is my final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and may prompt Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation.
* **The Numbers:** While my offer is more than Alice's initial proposal to me, it's still heavily weighted in my favor. I'm aiming to secure a significant portion of the money while understanding that Alice is also facing rapid devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Declining Value:**  The money is rapidly losing value. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer will only result in a smaller pot for both of us.
* **Her Position Weakening:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the devaluation, indicated by her willingness to compromise even after I presented a ""final offer.""  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in a future round is too risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and the value we're arguing over diminishes with each passing round."
