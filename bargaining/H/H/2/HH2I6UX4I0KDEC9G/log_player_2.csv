Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, time is running out and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's worth holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split is the fairest option. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  With time becoming critical, a 50/50 split is the most logical offer.  It demonstrates fairness to Alice, while also representing a firm stance against accepting a less favorable deal as inflation increases. This increases the chance of acceptance, as any further disagreement significantly risks both players walking away with nothing."
