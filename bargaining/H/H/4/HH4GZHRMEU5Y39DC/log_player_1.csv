"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my potential gain of 600,000$ in the first round is now worth 480,000$.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a gain of only 250,000$. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my potential gain of 480,000$ is now worth 384,000$.

I'll make a new offer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still trying to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not convinced! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation applied 3 times, my potential gain of 600,000$ in the first round is now worth 384,000$ x 0.8 = 307,200$.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not satisfied with a gain of only 450,000$. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my potential gain of 307,200$ is now worth 246,960$.

I'll make a new offer that's slightly higher than my previous offer, trying to get closer to a deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the middle, but I'm still the one making the move!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting too greedy, let's balance it out! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation applied 5 times, my potential gain of 600,000$ in the first round is now worth 246,960$ x 0.8 = 197,568$.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I still think I can do better than a 400,000$ gain.

However, I also don't want to risk waiting too long and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and we can finalize the deal.
