"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the next round will mean less money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a more even split, especially considering the money is worth less in this round. I'll try to do better next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make it a 50-50 split""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the money is worth less in this round. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
