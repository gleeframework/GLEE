9000.0,1000.0,"Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  This is a good starting point, and we can adjust it in later rounds if you'd like.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Your offer was a bit one-sided Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It accounts for me taking on more risk in later rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's split it 55/45, a more balanced approach. We both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Time is running out Alice, and the pot is shrinking. I'm sticking with a slight advantage for me, so 52/48.  Take it or leave it - we need to decide soon!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,We're getting closer to the deadline. Let's split it down the middle and avoid the risk of getting nothing. 50/50 is fair and we both walk away with a good chunk of money.,Alice,5,
