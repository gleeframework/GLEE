"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm not as enthusiastic about the split. Considering the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 5% less than in the previous round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which is a bigger hit.

I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll adjust my offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I notice that Bob is proposing a 50-50 split. Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, which is a bigger hit.

However, I also notice that Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair offer. Given that my gain is worth less due to inflation, I think it's a good opportunity to accept a more equal split.

I'll accept this offer.
