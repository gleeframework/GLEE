"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the lion's share (90%) while still giving Bob something (10%).  I'm hoping he'll accept, as I'm expecting the value of money to decrease more rapidly for him than for me in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money. The inflation rate is significant, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in future rounds."
