"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 20% share. The money is worth less now, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion. I'd like to make a new proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the current $800,000 (due to the 20% inflation from Round 1) and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can still do better than a 30% share. The money is worth significantly less now, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion. I'd like to make a new proposal for Round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm proposing that I get 42% of the current $800,000 (due to the 20% inflation from Round 1 and 48.8% from Round 2) and Bob gets 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm accepting this offer because the money is worth so little now, and I don't think I can do better than 10% of the remaining $266,666.67 (due to the cumulative inflation). It's a small share, but it's better than nothing."
