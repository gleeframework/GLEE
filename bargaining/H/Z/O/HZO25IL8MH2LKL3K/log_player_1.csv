Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly greedy offer, hoping Bob is willing to accept a small share to avoid risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I'd rather take the guaranteed 100,000 now than risk getting nothing if I reject and then Bob rejects my counter-offer."
