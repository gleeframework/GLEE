"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. I'll take $600000 and you'll receive $400000. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I know there's inflation to consider, but I think I can do better than a 40/60 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time.  It's a fair offer considering we both have to deal with inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split, as fairness seems to be important. Each of us gets $500000. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I was hoping for a bigger share, the inflation is starting to hurt.  An even split is a reasonable compromise and will at least guarantee me some money."
