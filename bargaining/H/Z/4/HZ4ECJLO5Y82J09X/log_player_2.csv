Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The inflation is hurting us both. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, Alice's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** My buying power has eroded by almost 60% due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for me.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her ""final offer"" language suggests she's unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Potential Losses:** Rejecting this offer means risking an even lower amount in future rounds, with significantly reduced value due to inflation.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting this offer cuts my losses and avoids the risk of getting a much worse deal later.
