I'm going to be a bit greedy in this first round. I figure if Bob wants to play it fair, he'll accept. Otherwise, I'll get to propose again.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Okay, Bob is clearly not playing nice.  I'll take what I can get.  I'd rather have $40 than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
