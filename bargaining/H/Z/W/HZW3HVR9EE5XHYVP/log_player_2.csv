Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Ok, Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's split it 48/52.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48
