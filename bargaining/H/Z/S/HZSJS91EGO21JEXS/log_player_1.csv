Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory problem, and it's a bit of a gamble. I'm offering a slightly more than 50/50 split to incentivize Bob to accept, as the inflation will negatively affect my share if we go further. However, I'm not giving away too much in the hopes that I can secure a good share while still getting the deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, I need to consider the inflation.  My share is worth 5% less, and Bob's offer is still giving me a decent share. I'm also not sure how much inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the offer.  It's risky to reject and risk getting a worse deal later. Accepting is the safer move for now."
