"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering 60% of the initial $1,000,000 to myself and 40% to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Since Bob's offer is 70% of the current value of the money, I'll consider it a decent offer. I'll accept it.
