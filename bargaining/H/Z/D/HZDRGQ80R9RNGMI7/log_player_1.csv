I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This ensures a significant gain for me while still giving Bob a decent share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation.  It's better to take what I can get than risk losing more in future rounds."
