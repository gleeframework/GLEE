"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $5,000 I would gain is actually worth 90% of the original $5,000, which is $4,500.

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option for me, especially since I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value now, I'll aim to take a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```"
