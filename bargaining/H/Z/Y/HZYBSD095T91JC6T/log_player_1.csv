"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer.  While it's a significant improvement from the last round, I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 
I'll offer a compromise - slightly less for me than my first offer, but more than Bob's."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a difficult decision as the inflation is starting to take a toll. While I would like more, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting. Accepting this offer ensures a decent amount, while rejecting could result in a much smaller share later."
