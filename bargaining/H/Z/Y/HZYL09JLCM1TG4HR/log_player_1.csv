"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. How about a more even split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 45$ is now worth 42.75$ (95% of 45$).

I'll think about Bob's offer... It's a more even split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a better deal for myself.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob 40$, which is a bit less than his previous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle,  it's the fairest way to go.  We can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 60$ from round 3 is now worth 51.84$ (86.4% of 60$), but since the game is now in round 4, my gain of 50$ is worth 54.2$ (54.2% of 100$).

I'll think about Bob's offer... Splitting it down the middle seems like a fair proposal, and I don't want to risk going to another round. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
