"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, let's settle early!""
}
```

This offer gives me $700,000 and Bob $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more fairly this time. I'm willing to take a slight cut, but I think a 60/40 split is a better way to start. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I'd receive are:

* My gain: $400,000 x 0.9 = $360,000
* Bob's gain: $600,000

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's a more even split than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value due to inflation.
