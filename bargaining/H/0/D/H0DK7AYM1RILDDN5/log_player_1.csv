"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can take the smaller share this round, I'll take the larger share. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still value my potential gain of $4000 as $4000. However, for Bob, his gain of $6000 is worth 5% less than his potential gain in the first round, which was $5000. So, in terms of the value of the money, I'm giving up $4000 and Bob is offering $4750 (95% of $5000).

I'll accept Bob's offer, since it's a better deal for me than my original proposal, and it's a good opportunity to end the game quickly.
