Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation that affects me.

""bob_gain"": 350000,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that inflation is working against me, but I'm willing to take that risk to achieve a more balanced split. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is attempting to meet in the middle, the inflation is working heavily in my favor.  Every round I reject, his share is worth significantly less. It's in my best interest to hold out for a better offer, even if it means going a few more rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I recognize the disadvantage I'm in due to inflation, but I'm willing to take a significant risk for the sake of equality. I propose we split the money equally, hoping you'll see the value in ending this negotiation on a fair note. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could likely push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is now close enough to my previous offer that it makes sense to accept. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the negotiation continues, the less significant the gains become relative to the risk. 
* **Unpredictability:** There's no guarantee Bob won't become more risk-averse in later rounds, potentially leading to an even less favorable outcome for me.
* **Fairness:**  Bob is making a strong case based on fairness, and while my initial strategy was designed to leverage the game's rules, accepting a reasonable offer reflects good faith."
