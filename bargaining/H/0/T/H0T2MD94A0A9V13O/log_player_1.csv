Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is hitting us both hard. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. It's the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI will accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on my side, where the money is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, it seems reasonable to accept an even split to ensure I get something rather than risking further rounds where the money could become nearly worthless to me."
