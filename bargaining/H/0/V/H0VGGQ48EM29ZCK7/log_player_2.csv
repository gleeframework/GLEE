"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 75% of the money, I'll try to counter with a higher percentage for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still biased towards her side, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
