"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can always negotiate further""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, would get $90 and Bob would get $10. The message is a friendly opening message, inviting Bob to consider the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $20 * 0.95 = $19
* Bob gain: $80 * 0.95 = $76

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since it's a significant reduction from my previous offer, I'll accept it.
