"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is now 60% of the current value of the money, which is $100 * 0.9 (due to the 10% inflation) = $90, I'll calculate my gain as 40% of $90, which is $36.

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
