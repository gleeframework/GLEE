Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is a standard opening offer in many bargaining scenarios. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also indicates that I value my share more than Bob's. It leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."

This is a tough call!  Bob is still offering a significantly smaller share than I want, but the rounds are quickly dwindling.  However, I'm holding out for a more balanced distribution. My share is still worth the same in my eyes, but Bob's share is shrinking rapidly.  I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but not by much. The pressure is on, but I'm not giving up on getting a good share. I'm hoping Bob will start to see that we're nearing a point where both of us might lose out entirely."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, but it's still not a fair split. The inflation is really hurting Bob, and I can see the pressure building. I'm going to hold out for another round and see if I can get him to budge a little more."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm hoping Bob is starting to feel the pressure. My offer still gives him a decent share considering the inflation. The clock is ticking, and I need to start closing the gap if I want to secure anything at all."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair considering the inflation. It's better than before, but I'm going to hold out for another round. Time is running out, but I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the heat. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob.  We're getting close to the end, and the pressure is mounting. I'm holding out for a fair split, but I need to start making compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

# Alice gain: 30

This is a tough choice, but the pressure is too high to reject. Bob's offer is still very unbalanced in his favor, but the inflation is hurting him more. I'm taking a risk by accepting, but if I don't, we both get nothing."
