"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, and hopefully, we can both get a good amount of money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal, and while I understand the effects of inflation, I believe we can still reach a more balanced outcome. I'm confident we can find a better split in the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I propose a 7000/3000 split. While the inflation has impacted the value of the money, I'm still willing to compromise.  This offer offers a significant amount for both of us and hopefully avoids further rounds of negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Although the inflation has taken its toll, I still believe we can find a more balanced outcome. This offer is significantly less favorable than my previous proposal, and I'm not willing to settle for such a large disparity. I'm hopeful we can find a more equitable solution in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 5000/5000 split.  The inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, but I believe an even split is the fairest solution at this point. It's a compromise that allows both of us to receive a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While inflation has continued to erode the value of the money, I still believe we can find a better solution. This offer is significantly less favorable than my previous proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I propose a 4000/6000 split.  Inflation has continued to make the money less valuable, and I'm trying to find a solution that still offers both of us a decent amount.  This offer is a slight concession to Bob, but I hope it will be enough to reach an agreement."
