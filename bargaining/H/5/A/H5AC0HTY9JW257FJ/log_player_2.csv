This is a terrible offer! While I'm sure Alice is hoping I'll be desperate, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal right away. I'll see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a more balanced offer, giving Alice a smaller share, but still a decent amount. I want to see if she's willing to negotiate a bit more fairly."
