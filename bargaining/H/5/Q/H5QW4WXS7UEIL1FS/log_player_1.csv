I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will be happy to accept it.  I'll keep most of the money, but I want to make sure he gets something, too!  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less generous than mine. Even though the value of my share has gone down by 10%, I'm not going to accept this deal. I'll try to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. I'll offer Bob a bit more than in the first round, but still keep a majority for myself. Hopefully, he'll see the value in this offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm not getting much, but with the inflation, my share is worth much less now. I'd rather have 5000 now than risk getting nothing at all.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
