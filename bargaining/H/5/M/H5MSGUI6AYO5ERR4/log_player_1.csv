"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation scenario, and it seems fair for Alice to take the lion's share as she is the one proposing first.  However, Bob will likely reject this and counter-propose.  Let's see how this game unfolds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome, especially considering Bob could have proposed an even more unfavorable split in the next round. It's better to secure a fair share than risk getting nothing."
