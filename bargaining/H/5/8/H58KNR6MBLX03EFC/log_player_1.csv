"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but it's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. With the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively getting 570,000. Meanwhile, Bob's gain is still worth 100% of what it was in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
