"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly. This offer is highly advantageous to me, but I'm feeling generous today.  If you reject it now, my offers will only get worse for you as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be fair. The money is already worth less to me, so I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###\nI'm trying to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and hoping she'll accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further for me. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure is on you, Bob, but I need a bit more than that. This offer is a compromise, and it's the best you'll get from me. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Although the value of the money is decreasing for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer is not good enough, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a more favorable outcome. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""I'm taking a hit from inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise. This is the best I can offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's end this game with a mutually acceptable deal.""}\n\n###\nI'm trying to convey to Alice that I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm still willing to find a middle ground. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split, considering the circumstances. Fingers crossed!"
