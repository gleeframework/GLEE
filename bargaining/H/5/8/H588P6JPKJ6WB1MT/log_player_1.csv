Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split in my favor is a fair compromise, considering the inflation penalty.  It's a small advantage for me, but still allows us to both get a decent share. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
