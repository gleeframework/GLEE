Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both want a somewhat larger share.  I'm proposing a split very close to 50/50, with a slight edge to me to counterbalance the inflation from another round. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050
