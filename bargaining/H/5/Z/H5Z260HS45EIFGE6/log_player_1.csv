"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm curious to see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. How about a 50/50 split? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be careful.

I'm not thrilled about a 50/50 split, as it's not as favorable to me as I'd like, considering the inflation. However, it's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk going into another round.

I'll accept this offer.
