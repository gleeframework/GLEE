I'm proposing a 900,000 - 100,000 split. I want to secure a large share early on, as the inflation will affect me more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob.  While I want a large share, I need to be strategic and avoid too much risk of being left with nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting a much smaller share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'd gain in a future round.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
