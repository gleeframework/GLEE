"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, as I am the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a more balanced proposal than my previous offer, acknowledging that Bob rejected my initial offer. I hope he sees the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, with each passing round the value of the money is decreasing significantly. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, although not my initial target. It's a calculated risk, but in the current circumstances, it's the most logical decision."
