I propose to take $6000 and give Bob $4000.  I think this is a fair and balanced starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to $5250,  while still offering Bob a good share of $4750. This is to incentivize him to accept the offer, as we are now in the third round and the value of the money continues to decrease with each round."
