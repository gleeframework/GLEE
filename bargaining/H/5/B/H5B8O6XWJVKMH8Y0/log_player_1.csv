"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60 is a good starting point, Alice. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.95 = 38
* Bob's gain: 60 * 1 = 60

Considering the reduced value of money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine was in the first round. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
