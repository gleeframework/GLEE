"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This is a fairly standard 4:1 ratio, which is a good starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, I think Bob's offer is a good one for me.

I accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
