Let's start with a fair split.  I'll propose 5000 for each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'll try to secure a bit more for myself, considering the inflation. I propose a 4500/5500 split, which is still more favorable to Bob than the previous round."
