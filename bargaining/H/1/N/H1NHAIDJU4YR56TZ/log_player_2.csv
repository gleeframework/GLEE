# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While my offers haven't been accepted yet, I need to hold firm. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to even my first offer. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. It's the only fair way to end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'fair' offer came a bit too late, I'm afraid 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has shifted considerably. Alice is unlikely to offer anything better now, knowing my previous offers and the increasing penalty from inflation. Accepting this prevents a total loss and is the best I can hope for at this stage."
