"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I acknowledge the potential for inflation, I believe this is a fair and balanced proposition that allows us both to gain a significant portion of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
