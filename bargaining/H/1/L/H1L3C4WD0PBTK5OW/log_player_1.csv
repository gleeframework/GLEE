"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a strong opening offer. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate or if he's going to try to push for a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than my initial offer, even with the 20% reduction in the value of his gains.  I'm going to accept this offer, as I don't want to risk further negotiation and potential loss of value due to inflation."
