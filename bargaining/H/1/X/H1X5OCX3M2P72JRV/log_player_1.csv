"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive.

My share would be $5000 / 0.95 = $5263.16 (5% less due to inflation)

Bob's share is still $5000.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split and I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing more value due to inflation.
