"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I want a bit more for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm not getting the same value as before.

I don't think this offer is fair, considering the value of my share is decreasing with each round. I'll reject the offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, 50-50 split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, hoping it's more appealing to him."
