"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll get more, let's see what you say 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to make a decision based on the reduced value.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a good chunk too!""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting smaller and smaller, I'm taking control now! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting tougher to swallow! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm really feeling the pinch.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. On one hand, I don't want to get left with a paltry $3000. On the other hand, Bob's offer is getting increasingly lopsided.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 3750, ""bob_gain"": 6250, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still want a decent chunk too!""}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, giving Bob a larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
