Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the deal is still not favorable to Bob, especially given the inflation working against her.  She's feeling the pressure and will likely concede further in the next round."
