"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000
* Bob gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a fair split. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
