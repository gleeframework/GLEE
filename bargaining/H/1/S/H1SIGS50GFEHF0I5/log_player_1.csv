"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to make his move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a little more this time. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the 60/40 split, as I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round due to the 10% inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to keep some leverage. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, and I'm hoping Bob will consider it a reasonable compromise."
