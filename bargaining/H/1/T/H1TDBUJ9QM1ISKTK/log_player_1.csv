Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 40% yet. You can try to do better if you want.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this round. Here's why:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer means another round, but there's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in the next round.  
* **Inflation:** The value of the money is dropping rapidly.  The longer the game goes on, the less value the money will have.
* **Limited Options:**  Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge much from his desired share.  Trying to get a better deal might lead to a final round where Bob takes a larger share, leaving you with even less. 

It's better to accept the offer, even if it's not ideal, and secure some value before inflation diminishes the money further."
