"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, the money is worth less than before, so I'll need to be careful not to give up too much.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll aim to get a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the money is worth much less than before. Bob's offer seems more reasonable now, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
