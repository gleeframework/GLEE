Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take a small share and we can call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 80/20 this time.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need the majority to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I would gain, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  If I reject, the next round will further reduce the value of the money for me, and it is unlikely Bob will offer me a better deal."
