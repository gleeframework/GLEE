"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money. If you don't like it, I'll try to negotiate further.""
}
```

This offer is worth 90% of the original amount, since it's the first round and the money is worth 10% less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch things up. I'll take 60% this time, and you can keep 40%. If you accept, we can get this done quickly. If not, we'll see what happens in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. While 40% of the money is less than I initially proposed, it's still a decent amount. But I'm not sure if I want to give Bob the upper hand. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 81% of the original amount now, due to two rounds of 10% inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, Bob. I'll give you 45% this time. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it even. I'll take 55%, you take 45%. We're both losing money with each round, so let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to wrap things up quickly. I'm not sure if I want to give him the upper hand, but on the other hand, we are losing money with each round. I'll consider this a decent compromise.
