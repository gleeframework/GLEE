I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a good starting point to ensure a fair division."

While Bob's offer is better than the previous rounds, it's still not a fair division considering the significant inflation he's experiencing. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer share."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Given the ongoing inflation and the fact that neither of us has been able to agree on a division, I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option in this situation, as it allows us both to receive a reasonable share considering the circumstances."
