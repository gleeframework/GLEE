I'll start by offering Bob a small amount.  It's likely he'll reject this, but it sets the stage for me to get a better deal later!  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me so little.  It's time to show him I'm not afraid to walk away. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a smaller share.  I'm hoping he'll realize that if he keeps rejecting, he'll risk getting nothing at all.  Let's see what he does."
