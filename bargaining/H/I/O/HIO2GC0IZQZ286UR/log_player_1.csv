"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob will get 20% of the initial $100, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  It's a better deal for both of us than losing money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth $45 (since it's 90% of the original $50).

I'm not sure if I'm willing to split it evenly, considering I could potentially get more in the next round. Let me think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 90% of its original value, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You didn't take the fair offer, now it's my turn to make a better one. I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still better than losing more to inflation.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the current $90 (which is 81% of the original $100), and Bob will get 40% of the current $90 (which is 72% of the original $100)."
