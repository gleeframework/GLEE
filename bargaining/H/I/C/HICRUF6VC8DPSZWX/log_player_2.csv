Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's fair considering I'm taking the risk of  rejection, and I'm sure we can both come to an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation."
