"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm willing to give Bob a decent share, but I'm also trying to get a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's fair considering I'm taking the risk of  rejection, and I'm sure we can both come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob is proposing a 60/40 split in his favor, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'm not willing to give up a significant portion of my share without getting a better deal. I'd like to make a new proposal and try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
