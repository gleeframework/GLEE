"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not afraid to take a bigger share, but I'll give you a small chance 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $2000, which is worth 95% of what I would have gotten in the first round. Not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

On the other hand, if I reject and we proceed to Round 3, the money will be worth another 5% less, and I'll have to make a new proposal. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do better.

I'll take a chance and reject Bob's offer. Maybe I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still need something to fall back on. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25-75 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a small chance to get a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me! The money is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $1000, which is worth only 10% of what I would have gotten in the first round. It's a tough pill to swallow.

However, if I reject and we proceed to Round 5, the money will be worth another 5% less, and I'll have to make another proposal. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do better.

I'll take a chance and reject Bob's offer. Maybe I can do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 19.26% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be even more cautious with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1500,
  ""bob_gain"": 8500,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Don't take all the cake!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 15-85 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor. I'm hoping he'll take pity on me and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to the edge, I'll take a bigger risk to get most of the cake 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me! The money is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $500, which is worth only 5% of what I would have gotten in the first round. It's a very small consolation prize.

However, if I reject and we proceed to Round 7, the money will be worth another 5% less, and I'll have to make another proposal. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do better.

I'll take a chance and reject Bob's offer. I'd rather have a small chance at a better deal in the next round than accept this extremely unfavorable offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 7, the money is worth 27.18% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be extremely cautious with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options, but I'll still try to salvage something. Please, don't crush me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 10-90 split, which is a very unfavorable deal for me. I'm hoping Bob will take pity on me and accept this offer, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're almost out of time, I'll take a huge risk to get most of the money 
# Alice gain: 250 
# Bob gain: 9750 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crushing me! The money is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $250, which is worth only 2.5% of what I would have gotten in the first round. It's a tiny consolation prize.

However, if I reject and we proceed to Round 9, the money will be worth another 5% less, and I'll have to make another proposal. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do better.

But, considering the extremely low amount I'll get, I think it's better to take this offer and try to salvage what's left. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will show some mercy.
