"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was tempting, but I think we can find a solution that benefits us both more in the long run. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  Due to inflation, the longer the negotiation goes, the less the money is worth. It's in Bob's best interest to secure a deal sooner rather than later because his money is losing value faster.
* **Fairness and Incentive:** While Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor, Bob's counter-offer aims for a more balanced split. This shows he's willing to negotiate but also values his own position. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering 55/45, Bob leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this proposal. They could potentially settle on a 52.5/47.5 split in the next round, which would still be beneficial for Bob compared to accepting Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 58-42 is a better split, considering the inflation. What do you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is better than risking further losses due to inflation. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** Alice's offer recognizes the impact of inflation and offers a slight improvement from her initial 60-40 split. 
* **Avoiding Further Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means Bob would have to propose a deal in Round 4, with the money worth even less. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a less favorable deal then, putting Bob at a greater disadvantage."
