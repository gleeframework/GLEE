"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to keep more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in this round is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the effective value of my gain is 4000 (5000 * 0.8).

Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: 3000 (effective value: 2400)
* Bob gain: 7000 (effective value: 5600)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's better than going to the next round and risking even more inflation. I'll accept this offer.
