"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm being a bit greedy here, but I want to see how Bob reacts to such a lopsided offer.  It will be interesting to see if he accepts or tries to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in later rounds."
