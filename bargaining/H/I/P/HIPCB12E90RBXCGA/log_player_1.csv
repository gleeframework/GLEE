Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to even. I'll take $55, and you can have $45.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's not wait any longer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
