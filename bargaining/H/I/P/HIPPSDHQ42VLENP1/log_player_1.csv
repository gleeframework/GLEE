"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split, keeping the bulk of the money for myself and giving Bob a small share. Since the money will be worth less to him in the next round, I expect him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, accepting this 50/50 split is still beneficial. The money is worth the same to me as in the previous round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future."
