"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get 10% and I get 90%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I want more than 10% of the money! Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be more practical, I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both move on.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. How about 70/30?  We both get a decent share, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would prefer more, 30% is better than nothing.  Let's close this deal before things get worse."
