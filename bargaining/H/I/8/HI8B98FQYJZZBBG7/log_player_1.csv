"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given that I am initiating the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, I'll be the one making the next proposal, but the money will be worth 5% less then. It's better to secure 4000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
