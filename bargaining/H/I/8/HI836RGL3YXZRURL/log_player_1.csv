"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly. If you reject, I'll make a more aggressive proposal.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively fair split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more. You'll get less if you reject this offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $540,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of value due to the inflation. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too low. I'll make a counter-proposal: 550k for me, 450k for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""My counter-proposal: 55% for me, 45% for you. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my previous one, but still a relatively fair split considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think you're being too greedy. I'm starting to think you'll never accept a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, my gain of $300,000 is worth 30.4% of its original value due to inflation, which is $304,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 70% of its original value, which is $700,000.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of value due to the inflation. I'll reject the offer and make another counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too low. I'll make a counter-proposal: 500k for me, 500k for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 40.8% of its original value due to inflation. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle: 50% for me, 50% for you. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division of the money."
