"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's a significant gain for Bob, it's only a $5 gain for me, and that's with the 20% inflation. I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself this time, but still aiming for a good portion of the money. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm willing to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less now, I'm still rejecting this offer. It's a very small gain for me, and I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.  With each round, the inflation is getting more serious, and I need to find a solution that works for both of us before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hitting hard, this offer is still too low. I'm going to keep negotiating for a better deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm taking a bit of a risk here by offering a significant amount to Bob, but I feel like it's necessary to make progress. The inflation is taking its toll, and I need to find a solution soon. I'm hoping this compromise will convince Bob to accept."
