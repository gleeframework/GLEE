It's a good start, but I'm sure I can get a better deal! Let's see what I can offer Alice in the next round."

Let's see if Alice is willing to compromise a bit!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this time. Hopefully, Alice will see that it's a fair deal, especially with inflation."
