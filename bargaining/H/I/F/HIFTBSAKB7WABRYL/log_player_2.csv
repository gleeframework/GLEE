"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your generosity, but my offer stands as a fair deal. Time is running out for both of us, let's agree and secure our shares. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. We're both losing out by not settling. Let's be pragmatic and take what's on the table. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the initial potential gain. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I need to convey a sense of urgency and finality to Alice. Offering a 55/45 split is still better than what I'd get if I accepted her previous offer, even with the inflation factored in. By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping Alice will recognize the need to compromise to avoid walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a higher share, but this is my final compromise.  Accepting now is better than delaying further and losing even more to inflation. Let's be reasonable and close this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** The situation has become critical. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, rejecting it means risking an even lower offer in subsequent rounds, further diminished by inflation.  Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum, and at this point, securing a decent portion is better than the potential of walking away with nothing."
