Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching down slowly, but it's still heavily in her favor, especially considering the inflation working against me more strongly.  I need to push for a more significant change in the next round."

Round 5

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but very slowly.  The inflation is hurting me significantly now, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would still give her a much larger share of the original value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer is a compromise, but we need to agree soon before inflation makes it pointless for both of us.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between our last offers, last chance before I get stubborn 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is as good as it's going to get. The round 7 inflation means I'm losing a significant chunk of value, and Alice is getting more stubborn. Accepting now secures a reasonable portion of the remaining value before inflation makes it even worse for me."
