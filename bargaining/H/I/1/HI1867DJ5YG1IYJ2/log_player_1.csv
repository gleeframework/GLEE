"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think for a moment... Considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

I'll accept this offer.
