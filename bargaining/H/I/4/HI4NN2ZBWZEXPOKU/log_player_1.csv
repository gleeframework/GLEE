"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a risky strategy here.  Since the money is worth less to me each round, I'm going to try to get the majority now and hope Bob doesn't see the value in waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is making it difficult for me to gain anything further. This offer ensures I get *something* and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in later rounds."
