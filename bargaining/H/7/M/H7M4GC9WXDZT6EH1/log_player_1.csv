Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take almost everything. I'm hoping Bob will be happy with a single dollar and accept the offer.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair offer. Better to get half the money now than risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting."
