I'm going to start by being generous, hoping to end the game quickly. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. It's not worth it to me, and I think I can do better by playing another round. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate a bit more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 40% of the money, and keep 60% for myself. This takes into account the inflation, and I believe it's a fair offer.  Hopefully, Bob will see it as a better deal than his previous offer."
