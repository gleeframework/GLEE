"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself 900,000 and Bob 100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point given the significant inflation disadvantage Bob faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I propose a 75/25 split, giving myself 750,000 and Bob 250,000. This is a compromise, recognizing the inflation disadvantage Bob faces while still ensuring I get a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, giving myself 600,000 and Bob 400,000.  I'm willing to offer a bit more to Bob this round, hoping to reach an agreement before the inflation further diminishes the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's share, this is the best offer I've received so far. Accepting will ensure I get at least some money, and it's better than risking another round and potentially getting nothing."
