Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a little closer to your offer, but I still need a larger share. Let's split it 52.5/47.5. This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation impacting us both. If we can't agree, we risk losing even more money in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
