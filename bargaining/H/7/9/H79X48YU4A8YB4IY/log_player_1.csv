"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I need a better deal than 10%. Let's start with 55/45.  It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust it in the next round if needed. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
