"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is my first offer. I believe it's fair to start with a proposal that heavily favors me, given the inflation dynamics and the fact that I am the one making the offer. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I initially proposed an unfair offer, I understand Bob's rejection. However, I am not willing to accept a proposal that is so heavily skewed in Bob's favor, especially with the inflation rates.  I believe there's still room for a more balanced division. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I am proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This acknowledges Bob's previous offer, but I am still taking into account the inflation, which makes his offer less appealing to me. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the time pressure and the value loss for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor. Even though the inflation is affecting my earnings more, I'm not willing to accept a proposal that gives me such a small share. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

We're getting closer to the end of the game, and the inflation is really starting to bite. I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. It acknowledges the inflation and provides a decent outcome for both of us."
