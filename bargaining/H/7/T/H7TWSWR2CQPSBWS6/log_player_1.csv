"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I think I should aim for a higher share. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant improvement from the initial offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the next offer""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, where I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and taking advantage of the fact that I'm making the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you the majority of the money, I think 60 is a fairer share for me 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

Considering the new values, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. However, I'm running out of time and options. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
