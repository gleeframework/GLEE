"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is good for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is fair, considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Let's see how this plays out in future rounds. I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking, and that money is losing value fast, especially for you. Let's be realistic and end this.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we've both been stubborn.  Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses. It's the most sensible option now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Bob is finally being realistic.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further losses to inflation, especially with his money devaluing faster than mine."
