"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The first offer from Alice is 4000 for me and 6000 for her. Considering the impact of inflation, if I don't accept this offer, the money's value will decrease by 20% for me in the next round, but remain the same for Alice. This gives her an advantage in subsequent rounds as my bargaining power diminishes due to inflation.\n\nHowever, accepting 4000 out of 10,000 seems like a conservative first offer, especially since we have 11 more rounds to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable agreement for me. On the other hand, the threat of inflation looms large, reducing the real value of any future offer I might receive or make.\n\nGiven the information and the significant number of rounds left, I'll choose to reject this offer in hopes of negotiating a better deal, but with caution due to the inflationary pressure.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's first offer, it's now my turn to propose a division. Given that the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each passing round, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable distribution but still keep it reasonable to encourage Alice to accept, considering the game's early stage.\n\nLet's propose a division where I get 5500 and Alice gets 4500. This offer gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer but doesn't drastically shift the balance, hopefully making it palatable for her while also accounting for the future devaluation of the money for me.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Aiming for a bit more balance, considering the future rounds and the impact of inflation on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting you hard. I'm offering a deal where you still get something substantial now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure of inflation is indeed mounting, reducing the real value of any potential gain I might receive. Alice's offer of 3500 for me and 6500 for her reflects her awareness of this dynamic, as she hasn't significantly increased her offer from the first round, despite my attempt to negotiate for more in round 2.\n\nGiven that we're only in round 3 and I have 9 more rounds to potentially improve my outcome, I'm inclined to reject this offer. However, the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation means that any future gains will be worth less in real terms. It's a gamble between accepting a lesser amount now or risking further devaluation in pursuit of a potentially better split.\n\nConsidering the game's structure and the remaining rounds, I'll reject this offer, aiming to find a better deal or to make Alice reconsider her position in light of the potential for mutual loss if we fail to agree.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","As we move into round 4, I must consider the increasingly detrimental effect of inflation on my potential gains. Given that the money is now worth 36% less for me than in the first round, and this trend will continue, I need to adjust my strategy to reflect this urgency.\n\nMy previous offer was 5500 for me and 4500 for Alice, which she rejected. Considering the inflationary pressure, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer to try and reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Let's propose a division where I get 5200 and Alice gets 4800. This offer aims to find a middle ground, acknowledging the impact of inflation on my bargaining position while still trying to secure a substantial portion of the funds.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Acknowledging the impact of inflation, aiming for a mutually acceptable middle ground to avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. Take this offer while it's still decent for you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The relentless march of inflation continues, eroding the value of any potential gain I might secure. Alice's latest offer of 3000 for me and 7000 for her is less favorable than her previous ones, reflecting her strengthening bargaining position as the rounds progress.\n\nAt this juncture, I must weigh the severely diminished value of the money against the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining 7 rounds. The prospect of both of us walking away with nothing is becoming increasingly plausible, which might prompt Alice to reconsider her strategy in future rounds.\n\nHowever, given the precipitous decline in the value of the money for me, I'm inclined to accept this offer. The risk of further devaluation and the possibility of ending up with nothing outweigh the potential benefits of continued negotiation. It's a less-than-ideal outcome, but it guarantees me a certain amount, albeit significantly reduced by inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
