"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a decent share.  Let's find a middle ground where we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiations in her favor. While her offer is better than the first, it's still heavily skewed towards her. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share, especially with inflation eating into my potential gains."
