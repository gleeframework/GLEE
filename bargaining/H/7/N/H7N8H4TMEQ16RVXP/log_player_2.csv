I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I can likely get a better deal by pushing for a higher percentage. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."

Alice's offer is still not good enough for me. Even with the inflation, I can still get a better deal by pushing for a higher percentage. I'll see what she offers in the next round."

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too low, even with the significant inflation. I'm not willing to settle for less than 50%. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
