Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is heavily discounting the impact of inflation and trying to secure a deal that still heavily favors her.  While the difference is narrowing, I need to push for a more equitable split before time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's end this negotiation with a fair and equal split.  Every round that passes hurts you more than me. 50/50 is the most logical solution.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to offer a strong and clear proposal to encourage Alice to settle. A 50/50 split is the most logically sound offer considering:

* **Fairness:** It reflects the equal participation in the negotiation.
* **Inflation:**  While it doesn't impact me, Alice loses value every round, making this offer increasingly attractive to her as time passes.
* **Urgency:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, a deadlock benefits neither of us."
