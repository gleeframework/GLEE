"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so $4,000 is equivalent to $3,800 in the first round's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, hoping to find a compromise."
