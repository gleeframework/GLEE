Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, considering our respective inflation rates. Let's work together to get the most out of this deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, but I need to consider the long game. 

Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Offer:**  He gets $60 (worth slightly less due to inflation), I get $40 (worth significantly less). This favors him, especially in the long run.
* **My Leverage:** The inflation heavily impacts me. Each round I wait significantly reduces the value of my potential winnings.
* **Future Rounds:**  If I reject, I get to propose in Round 3. However, the value decreases further. Will I be able to propose something Bob accepts that's better than $40 now?

Given the significant inflation working against me, I think it's best to take what I can get now.
