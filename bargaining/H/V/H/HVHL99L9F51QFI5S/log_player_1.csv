"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're just beginning the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a slightly more aggressive offer than before. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is dropping quickly!

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer. I think I can live with a 45-55 split.
