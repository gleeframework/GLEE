"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep a majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a majority of the money, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer, hoping to get at least $4,000.
