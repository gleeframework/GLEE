"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to get the maximum possible share in the first round.  I figure Bob might accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of getting nothing due to the decreasing rounds and inflation is too high. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
