"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message encouraging him to accept this initial proposal. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a smaller share now, but I need a larger share in the future to make up for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the larger share""
}


I've increased Bob's share slightly, but I'm still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the deadline. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to offer you a smaller share now, but I need a bigger share later to offset the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I still think Bob's offer is too skewed in his favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and I'm willing to make a compromise. This is a fair offer considering the inflation""
}


I've decreased my share slightly, trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. With the inflation, I need a significantly larger share to make this worthwhile. If we don't agree now, we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I don't like the offer, but considering the inflation and the fact that we're running out of time, I think it's better to accept this deal rather than risk losing everything. Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, so his ""larger share"" isn't as valuable as it seems. I'll take the 20 dollars and end the game."
