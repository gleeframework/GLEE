Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation is affecting me less. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a bit more, considering the inflation difference is in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting $40 now is better than risking getting $0 later. However, Alice knows the inflation is hurting me more.  I'll push my luck one more round and hope she gets nervous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm making a final offer, factoring in the inflation. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. The inflation is really hurting you now. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is getting too risky.  While $38 is significantly less than I wanted, it's better than getting $0 if we run out of rounds. Alice is clearly playing hardball, but at this point, something is better than nothing."
