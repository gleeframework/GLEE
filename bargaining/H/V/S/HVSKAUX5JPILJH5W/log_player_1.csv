Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is non-negotiable. We split it 50/50 or we both walk away with nothing. The inflation is becoming critical, and I'm not going to accept anything less than an even split. It's time to be fair and end this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting risky, and with Bob's offer being 50/50, it's the fairest option at this point. The inflation is seriously hurting his gains, making it unlikely he'll make another offer that's better for me.  It's time to secure what I can."
