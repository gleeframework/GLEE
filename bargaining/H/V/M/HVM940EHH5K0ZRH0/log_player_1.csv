"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'll have to adjust my strategy. I'll reject this offer since it's even more skewed towards Bob's favor than my initial offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to adjust my proposal to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering a slightly more even split, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."
