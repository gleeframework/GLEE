"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nI am suggesting a division of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob, with the message ""Let's divide it fairly"". This division gives me a slight advantage, but still offers Bob a significant amount of money. Since the money loses value over time, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is losing value, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer gives him a significantly larger share than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll make a new proposal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money, and try to find a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, last chance""}\n\nI'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a compromise between our previous proposals. I'm emphasizing that this is the last chance for Bob to accept a reasonable offer before the money loses even more value. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this fair division rather than risking further devaluation."
