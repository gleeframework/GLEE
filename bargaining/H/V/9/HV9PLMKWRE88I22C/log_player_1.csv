"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving myself the larger share.  I'm starting off strong, hoping to secure a favorable outcome early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Inflation will continue to erode the value of the money, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split ensures I receive a significant portion of the money."
