"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting amount.  Let's see how this goes! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000$ is a decent starting amount, it's worth considering the future rounds and the effects of inflation. It's more beneficial to see what kind of offers Alice might make in the next round, especially since the value of the money will decrease for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a bigger share, but let's avoid getting into a spiral of declining offers.  I think we can both get a decent amount if we play it smart.""
