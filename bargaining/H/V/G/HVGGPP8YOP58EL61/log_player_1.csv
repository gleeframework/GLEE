"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is not equal, I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money over time. I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk getting an even smaller share later.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
