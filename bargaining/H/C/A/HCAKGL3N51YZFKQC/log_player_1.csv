"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not getting a fair share. I want a bigger slice of the pie!"
