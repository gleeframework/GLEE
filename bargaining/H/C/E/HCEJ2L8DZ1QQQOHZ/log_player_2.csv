"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, I know the money will be worth less over time due to inflation affecting my share. It's better to hold out for a larger portion in the later rounds, even if it means taking a risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you wanted a larger share for making the first offer, but it's important to split this fairly given the inflation. This offer is a good compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value decreases with each round, Bob.  Let's be reasonable. This is a better offer than your last. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pressure me by highlighting the inflation, but her offer is still worse than what I proposed last round.  I need to hold firm and aim for a better split, even with the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to a deal, but it needs to account for the decreasing value.  This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob. The clock is ticking and the pot is shrinking. Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right.  The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
