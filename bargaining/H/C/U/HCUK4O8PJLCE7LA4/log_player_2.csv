# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were close, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. Let's split it fairly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, time is working against me more than Alice.  It's still better to hold out and hope Alice becomes more reasonable, as accepting a deal heavily skewed in her favor only makes sense in the very last rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering the time pressure. Don't let this slip away.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting into the later rounds, and I need to signal some flexibility while still trying for a slight advantage.  This offer is a bit better for Alice than a previous one she rejected, but the inflation means it's getting worse for me each round. This hopefully conveys a sense of urgency without being overly generous."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, and while the offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  With 5 rounds left, I need to hold out hope for a better deal, because accepting this sets a bad precedent for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  A slight edge to me, but the clock is ticking. Let's be smart and take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The end game is here. I need to make a strong move to avoid getting nothing. Offering a slight advantage to myself while still giving Alice a better deal than previous rounds might be enough to convince her.  The message emphasizes urgency and the risk of walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a good deal, I'm not getting any more generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but I still have to reject. Alice is playing hardball, but her idea of ""generous"" is highly subjective. Accepting this offer means losing over half the value to inflation. With only three rounds left, I need to gamble that she'll break before I do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm giving you the advantage here. It's more important that we both get something than walk away with nothing. Let's end this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are now in a high-stakes game of chicken.  Alice is likely feeling confident after I rejected what she called her ""final offer"". I need to make a concession to show I'm serious, and a 48/52 split in her favor might be just tempting enough to get her to agree, even if it favors her. The message is framed to appeal to her self-interest while conveying the very real possibility of failure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really running out of time, this is the best you'll get 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but I have to accept.  With only one round left, rejecting this offer means risking getting absolutely nothing. Alice has all the leverage now, and while this offer is heavily in her favor, it's better than going home empty-handed."
