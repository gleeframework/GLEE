"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small portion (100,000) to hopefully get the game over quickly.  I'll keep the majority, but as the game progresses, the value of the money will decrease faster for Bob than for me, so this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! While I'm losing 5% of the value, he's losing 10%. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is too one-sided.  I'll counter with a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob to 400,000. This is a significant jump from my initial offer. I'm hoping that with the increasing inflation, this will be appealing enough for him to accept.  If not, we'll continue to negotiate, but I'm willing to make concessions to avoid a lengthy game."
