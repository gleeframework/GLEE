"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a fair offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for Bob! While Alice is starting with a seemingly ""fair"" approach, the significant inflation against her incentivizes her to negotiate quickly. Bob has a lot of leverage in this scenario."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The inflation puts pressure on you more than me. This is a strong starting point for further negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is affecting me more, but I still believe we can find a more balanced split. This offer is more fair than your last one. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but this offer is still not in Bob's best interest.  She's trying to frame it as ""fair,"" but the longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll become. Bob can afford to hold out for a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7500,
""alice_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money for you. I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but this needs to be settled soon.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a fairer split, but I recognize the time pressure. Let's work together to find a solution before the value of the money drops too much for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is cracking:** Her message indicates a shift in tone. She's acknowledging the time pressure and the need for a solution. This suggests she's more willing to compromise.
* **Favorable split:** While not ideal, a 60/40 split in Bob's favor is a significant gain compared to the initial offers. 
* **Time is running out:**  With each round, the potential gains for both sides diminish. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a worse offer or even nothing as the deadline approaches."
