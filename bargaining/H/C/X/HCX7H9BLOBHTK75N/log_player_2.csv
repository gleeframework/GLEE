# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer. The inflation isn't too bad yet, and I think I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I think we should meet closer to the middle. 53 for me and 47 for you seems fair considering we're both losing value each round.""}"
