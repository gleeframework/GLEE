"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and equal split, but I'm taking a slightly larger share to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to do better 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $270,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $665,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I'd like to get a better share of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 81% of the original amount (90% * 90%), which is $810,000. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the strong one""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and leaving $450,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is a bit cheeky, implying that I'm still in the lead and he needs to do better to catch up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to turn the tables, your turn to get closer to 40% 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 73.9% of the original amount (100% - 26.1%), which is $729,000. I'll consider Bob's offer and decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the remaining money, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further inflation."
