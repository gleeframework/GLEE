"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable offer, considering that the money is worth more to me in this round than it will be in subsequent rounds. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly considering the inflation rates.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is a more reasonable compromise.""
}

I'm making a slightly more conservative offer this time, taking into account that the money is worth 5% less to me and 20% less to Bob than in the initial round, and also considering Bob's offer in the previous round. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
