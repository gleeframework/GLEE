Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know time is running out, but I still think 50-50 is too generous. I'll give you a bit more, but that's as far as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the impact of inflation is starting to really hurt. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of 4400 is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds.
