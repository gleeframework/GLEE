"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself. This is a strong opening offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value my share. It leaves room for Bob to counter if he wants, but also encourages him to accept before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  While I don't know how inflation affects him, it's clear that the 50/50 split is a compromise that benefits him more. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to 8000/2000, still giving myself a larger share but showing a willingness to compromise.  This demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement while still maintaining a good portion of the potential gains.  I believe this offer is fair, given the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me. While I acknowledge the potential for him to be more heavily impacted by inflation, his offer is still too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm dropping my offer further to 7000/3000. I'm aiming for a gradual decrease to encourage Bob to consider accepting before the inflation truly starts hurting him.  This offer still gives me a substantial share while acknowledging the potential for further concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I acknowledge the increasing risk of ending the game with nothing, Bob's offer is becoming progressively more unfavorable for me. I'm determined to get a better split and believe I can still negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm dropping my offer again to 6000/4000. It's getting risky with each passing round, but I'm confident that Bob will realize the need to settle before we both end up with nothing. This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the pressure is mounting, Bob's offer is still too far away from a fair split. His offer is getting worse with each round, and I'm unwilling to settle for such a low share. There are still rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're nearing the end of the game, and the risk of getting nothing is growing. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, recognizing that we both need to compromise. This offer is fair, considering the current inflation and the dwindling rounds. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in settling now before it's too late."
