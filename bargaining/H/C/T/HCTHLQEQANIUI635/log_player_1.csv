"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm really trying to get as much as I can for myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect your share more than mine.  Let's make this a quick deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll analyze the offer:

* My gain is $4,000, which is 10% less than the $6,000 I initially offered.
* Bob's gain is $6,000, which is 5% less than the $6,400 he initially offered.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm still getting less than I initially offered, but Bob's gain is also decreasing faster than mine.

I'll decide to reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a bigger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You said 60-40 was fair, but I think I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time. Don't expect me to be generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm still trying to get a bigger chunk of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly this time.  The inflation is getting to both of us, and this is a fair way to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more reasonable this time.

Let's analyze the offer:

* My gain is $5,000, which is 50% of the remaining money. This is a relatively even split, considering the inflation.
* Bob's gain is also $5,000, which is the other 50% of the remaining money.

Given the significant inflation that's occurred, I think this offer is a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money. I'll decide to accept the offer.
