"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This seems like a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should split it more evenly, 55 for me and 45 for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both lose money with every passing round.  A 50/50 split seems fair given the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###  \n\n### I'll accept the offer since it's a 50/50 split and the money is losing value with each passing round. It's better to take the offer now rather than risking further loss due to inflation. \n\n###"
