"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share to start, but still a fair offer. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with inflation!

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially with the money losing value due to inflation!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a more balanced split, especially since I'm offering a bit more than I did in round 1."

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm willing to accept a 48/52 split, especially considering the money's value is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, considering the money's value is decreasing. I think this is a fairer split!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a 60/40 split, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting a deal that accounts for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I think I should get a slightly bigger share considering the original split. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 52/48 split, especially considering the significant decrease in the money's value. I'll try to negotiate for an even better deal next round, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the time running out!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The clock is ticking! With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I'll make a more aggressive offer for round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, considering the inflation is eating away at our potential earnings. I think this is the best I can offer!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a 65/35 split, hoping Bob will accept a deal that prioritizes my share given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a 50/50 split, but I think I should get a slightly bigger share considering the original offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money's value is decreasing rapidly, and I'm running out of time! I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 8:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the inflation and the time running out, I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept this deal and move on to the next round, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
