"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this.  I believe it's a fair offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation and tries to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for you.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3250 
# Alice gain: 6750 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I think accepting this offer is the best option. The money is worth 36% less for me now, and further rounds would only decrease its value. Alice's offer of 3250, although not ideal, seems like the most reasonable choice given the circumstances."
