"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer.  You get a good chunk of the money, and I keep the majority.  Accept and let's both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While the offer is tempting, it's a huge risk to accept in the first round.  Waiting to see what Alice proposes next might give me a better deal, especially considering the money loses value with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it closer to the middle.  This is a fair starting point, and we can both benefit from ending the game early.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to keep a larger share to account for the inflation affecting me more.  Let's end this game now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is being more generous, the inflation is hitting me harder.  There's still a lot of money at stake, and I think I can get a better deal if we continue."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 600k for myself.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation.  Let's end this game and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting squeezed by inflation, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Accept this offer and let's both get something before the money becomes worthless. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hurting me a lot, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  This offer is decent, and while I'd prefer more, it's a good compromise to get some money before the value plummets even further."
