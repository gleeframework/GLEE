"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I was willing to give Bob a 40% share initially. I think I can do better than this. Let's see what I can come up with in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still a good compromise!""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial proposal, while still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve more for my patience! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced share again, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept another reduced share, especially since I was willing to give Bob a slightly bigger share in my previous offer. I think I can do better than this. I'll try to come up with a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of Bob's money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair compromise in the end!""}

I'm trying to find a fair and balanced split, considering the decreasing value of Bob's money due to inflation. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
