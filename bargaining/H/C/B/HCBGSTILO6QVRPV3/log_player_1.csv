"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm really trying to get the higher amount to maximize my gain. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced start, let's see if you'll accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to make a decision based on the new values.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share. Bob's offer is 60% for him and 40% for me, but considering the inflation, I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get an even higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, time to take it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. I'm trying to get a higher share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm not giving in yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each passing round! I'll have to be careful.

However, Bob's offer is the same as the one I rejected in Round 2, but considering the inflation, it's actually a better deal for me. I'll accept this offer to get a higher amount of money, even though it's not the highest I could get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
