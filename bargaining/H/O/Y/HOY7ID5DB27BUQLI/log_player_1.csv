"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, giving me 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but it's still a relatively fair one.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
