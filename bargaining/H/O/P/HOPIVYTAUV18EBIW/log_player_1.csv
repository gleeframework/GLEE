"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit one-sided.  Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more since the value decreases for me over time, but we can still make this work for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
