"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I'll take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob will get 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
