"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This way, I get 75% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

For me, the effective gain would be 640000 * 0.8 (20% less) = 512000
For Bob, the effective gain would be 360000 * 0.9 (10% less) = 324000

I'll accept Bob's offer.
