"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  Since we are both starting out, I think it's important to establish a strong first offer, but I also don't want to be too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm lowering my share to 600,000, hoping to reach an agreement.  While I still want a significant portion, I recognize that we need to compromise to avoid further rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though I'm losing more value with each round, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob keeps raising his share, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding out for a larger share. This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the inflation we've experienced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, my share has decreased significantly, and I risk losing even more if we continue. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further inflation."
