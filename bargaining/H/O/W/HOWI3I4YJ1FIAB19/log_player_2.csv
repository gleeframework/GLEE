Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 420000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before I take more! 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer results in a larger net gain for Bob than holding out and likely receiving an even smaller amount next round."
