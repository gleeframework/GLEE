"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk.""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a more balanced offer. You'll get a decent share, but I'll keep some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $5,000."
