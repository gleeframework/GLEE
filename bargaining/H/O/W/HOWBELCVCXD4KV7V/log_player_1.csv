"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, since we're both taking a risk with this inflation thing. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually worth $3800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially since I'm the one taking on the risk of inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the inflation risk is on my side. Can you meet me at 55/45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 90.25% of its original value due to the 5% inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. I'll give you $4500 and keep $5500. What do you think?""
}
