"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money 7:3, or I'll make a better offer next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if he'll accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is fairer.  Accept this and we can both move on.  If you reject, we'll be stuck in this loop for a long time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks a 6:4 split is fairer, but I'm not convinced. My gain would be $400,000, which is still a significant amount, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on the money's value, my gain is now worth even less. I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share. Accept this and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```"
