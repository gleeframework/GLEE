"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, as I'm taking on the risk of the next round's inflation. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I understand Bob's reasoning about taking on the risk of the next round's inflation. Considering the inflation effect, I'm willing to accept this offer. Here's my response:
