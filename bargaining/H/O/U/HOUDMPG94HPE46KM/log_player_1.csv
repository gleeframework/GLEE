"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This leaves me with $600,000, which is 60% of the original amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amount I'd gain is $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000. Bob's offer is $500,000, which is a bit more than I'd get, but not by much. I'll accept this offer.
