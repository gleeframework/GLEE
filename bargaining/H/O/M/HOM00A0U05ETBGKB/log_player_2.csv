"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. This way, we both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want a better deal!  I'm going to try to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. We both get a good amount, and we avoid the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45, which is closer to your previous offer.  We need to work together to avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer and avoid further inflation.  We both get a decent amount, and it's a good compromise."
