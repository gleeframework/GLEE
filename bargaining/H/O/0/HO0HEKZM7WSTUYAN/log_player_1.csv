"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the potential for inflation to decrease the value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll think about it in terms of the original value.

In the original value, Bob's offer would be equivalent to me getting $6,250 and Bob getting $6,250. It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept it.
