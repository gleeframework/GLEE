"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. I'd like to negotiate further, as I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm worth more to this deal than you think""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split in my favor, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value now.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. $400,000 is better than nothing, and I'm not sure I can do any better."
