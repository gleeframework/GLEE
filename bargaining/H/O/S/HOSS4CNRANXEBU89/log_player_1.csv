"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice, let's keep it simple and split this evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation means I'm actually losing value. I need to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5488,
""bob_gain"": 4512,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this game. Let's be reasonable. I'll take a smaller increase to end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that the longer this takes, the less I get due to inflation. This puts a bit of pressure on Bob to settle.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a smaller increase compared to my Round 1 proposal, signaling I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Advantageous:** This offer still gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation I've already experienced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the time pressure, and this is the same offer you made in the first round. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** While this is technically less than what I could have gotten in Round 1, the continued inflation means waiting longer will only hurt me more. Bob is unlikely to offer anything better, and accepting now cuts my losses."
