"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is already getting less valuable, and Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping he'll be more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but not at the expense of my own gain""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a reasonable amount for myself, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I want a slightly larger share than in your offer 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit on Bob's share, I'll consider his new offer. However, I still think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm holding out for a better deal, hoping Bob will be more generous in his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob gets a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu! Bob's coming back to the same offer I made in round 1, but with a smaller amount due to inflation. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to wrap up the game and get my share, even if it's not as much as I had hoped for initially."
