This is a tough one! While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why: 

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Waiting longer means I'll get even less, even if Bob offers a slightly better split.
* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds. If I reject this, we risk walking away with nothing. 
* **Better Than Nothing:**  55% of a diminishing value is still better than 0%. 

It's a gamble, but accepting ensures I get something rather than potentially nothing."
