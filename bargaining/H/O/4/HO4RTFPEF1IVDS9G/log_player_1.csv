I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob will take it, or if he wants to risk playing further.  The longer the game goes on, the more we both lose!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a more favorable split, it's clear Bob is not willing to risk further rounds.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I would rather take it than risk losing even more money to inflation."
