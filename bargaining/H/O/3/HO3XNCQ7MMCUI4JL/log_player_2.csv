"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose I get $60 and you get $40. It's important to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle - this is a fair split considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about meeting in the middle, but the value decreases significantly for me with each round. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor? This way we both get a decent share considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
