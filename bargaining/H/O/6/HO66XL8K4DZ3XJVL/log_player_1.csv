"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money I gain is worth less in each round, and Bob's is worth even less. 
* **Fairness:** Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is the most fair and equitable solution considering the diminishing value of the money. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting the offer means potentially getting even less in the next round, as the inflation penalty is higher for Bob. 

By accepting, I guarantee myself half of the money, which is better than risking it all in the hope of a slightly better deal later."
