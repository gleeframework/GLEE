"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I propose a 55/45 split in your favor. It's a fair compromise considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500
