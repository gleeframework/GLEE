I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept such a low offer right off the bat. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair and gives us both a good starting point."
