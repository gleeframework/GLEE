Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but Bob's resolve is important here.  While the value is decreasing, accepting a deal heavily in Alice's favor isn't ideal. There's a chance Alice, fearing Bob will accept a poor deal in later rounds, makes a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more rounds and the inflation will just hurt us both.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a ""last stand"" offer.  Alice is clearly aiming to maximize her gain, but Bob's consistent rejections show he's willing to play the long game.  

* **50/50 Split:** This is the fairest offer and a strong point to argue from.
* **Direct Appeal:**  The message directly addresses the absurdity of the situation.
* **Inflation Threat:** Reminding Alice of the shrinking pot adds pressure to settle. 

It's unlikely Alice will accept, but this sets a strong precedent for future rounds and might push her to offer something more reasonable next time."
