"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. I believe this is fair considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's too early in the game to accept.  The inflation factor means that waiting a few rounds could potentially get me a better deal.  Rejecting will also put the pressure on Alice to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in our favor.  This is a fairer distribution considering the time pressure and the potential impact of inflation. Let's work together to get the most out of this game.""}
