"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. Let's be more realistic. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This acknowledges your initial advantage, but also accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
