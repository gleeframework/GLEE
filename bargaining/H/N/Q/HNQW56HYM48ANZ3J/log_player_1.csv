Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a slightly larger share. I'll reject Bob's offer.
