"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
I'll start by offering a generous split, hoping Bob will accept it. This way we can both get a good amount of money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's tempting, the inflation will hurt Bob more than it will me in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly, hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept. He's losing a lot more due to inflation than I am, so I'm trying to find a balance that is fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm getting a better deal than the previous round, Bob's offer is still not worth it to me. I'm still confident I can get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
``` 

I'm lowering my offer again, but I think this is the point where Bob will start to feel the pressure of inflation.  I'm aiming for a split that is fair to me, but also recognizes that he's losing a significant amount of value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  While Bob is getting a worse deal due to inflation, I'm confident that I can still get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to stick with a similar offer as before.  I'm confident that the pressure of inflation will finally convince Bob to accept."
