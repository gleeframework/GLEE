This offer gives me a large share while still leaving Bob with something.  It's a good starting point, and I think it will be fair given that the money is worth less to Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is unfair. It's basically the opposite of what I offered, and I don't see why I should accept it.  I'll counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still keeping a majority.  Since the money is worth less to Bob each round, this should be a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a very unbalanced deal.  He's taking advantage of the fact that his money is worth less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll make another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get a decent share.  This offer is still a majority for me, but it gives Bob a larger share than before. Hopefully, he sees that we're getting closer to a fair agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair. He's taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in that easily. I'll make another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm getting closer to meeting Bob halfway, but I need to hold onto a significant portion of the money.  This is my final offer before we risk losing everything."
