"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  This gives me the majority of the money, but still allows Bob something.  I hope this is fair enough for him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept Bob's offer.  While it's less than I was hoping for, the inflation means the money is worth less each round.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
