Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but this is my final offer. Take it, or risk losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage against Bob. While her offer is getting ""better,"" waiting any longer is a terrible strategy. Bob needs to be firm to get a reasonable deal.  He's lost a decent chunk to inflation already, but Alice doesn't seem to want to budge much. It's a risky gamble, but Bob needs to push Alice further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it - a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest offer and avoids the risk of losing even more to inflation for both of us.""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a firm but fair offer. It's clear Alice is trying to take advantage, but a 50/50 split is logically sound and difficult for her to argue with. 

* **Directness:** The message is clear and leaves no room for misinterpretation.
* **Finality:**  The tone suggests this is Bob's best offer, increasing the pressure on Alice.
* **Appeals to logic and fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and highlighting the inflation risk reminds Alice that it's in her best interest to settle now too."
