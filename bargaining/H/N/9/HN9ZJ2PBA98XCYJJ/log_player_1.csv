"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This way, we both get a fair share, with a slight emphasis on my portion.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is still a fair share.  Let's end this game and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
