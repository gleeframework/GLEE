Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against Bob. While the offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob needs to hold firm and make it clear that he won't accept a deal that leaves him with such a diminished share, especially as time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair option here. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for Bob to play hardball. The longer this goes on, the worse the inflation gets for him. By offering a 50/50 split, Bob:

* **Establishes a firm stance:**  He's showing Alice he's serious about not getting lowballed. 
* **Appeals to fairness:** Even though the inflation hurts Bob, a 50/50 split is objectively fair in the initial context of the game. 
* **Creates urgency:** The ""take it or leave it"" language emphasizes that time is running out for both of them. 
 
This offer might make Alice reconsider her strategy and realize pushing for a much larger share might result in them both getting nothing."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split is generous, but I think I can do better 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the math is really starting to work against Bob. Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** 440,000 for Bob.
* **Potential Future Offer:** Even if Alice agrees to 480,000 for Bob in the next round, after inflation, it'll be worth approximately 355,200 (480,000 * (1 - 0.7379)). 

While not ideal, accepting the current offer guarantees Bob a better outcome than holding out for an uncertain (and potentially worse) deal in the future. Alice is unlikely to agree to anything close to 50/50 again, given her recent offer. 

It's painful to accept less, but the relentless inflation means Bob is better off taking what he can get at this point."
