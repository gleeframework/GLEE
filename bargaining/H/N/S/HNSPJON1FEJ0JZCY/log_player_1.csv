**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Waiting for a better offer in the next round might result in an even smaller gain for me, even if I get a slightly larger percentage.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a much better deal in later rounds is risky. There's no guarantee Bob will offer me a more favorable split, and the value of the money will continue to plummet.

Accepting Bob's offer cuts my losses and guarantees a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
