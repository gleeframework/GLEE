Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the time pressure and inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer acknowledges the time pressure, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold out for a better deal, aiming for at least a 45/55 split in my favor to compensate for the inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. We're running out of time. This offer considers the time constraint and gives us both something.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: With time running out and inflation affecting you more, I'm taking a firmer stance. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking getting even less in later rounds due to the rapidly increasing inflation. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting is the least risky option at this point."
