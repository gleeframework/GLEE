Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob takes the deal!  I'm hoping to keep a good chunk of the money, knowing the inflation will hit him harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy with the deal, it's better than getting nothing at all in the later rounds. Bob's offer is more fair than mine, and with each passing round, my share will be worth less, making it harder to negotiate."
