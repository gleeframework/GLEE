 I'm proposing a near-even split, but I'm keeping the vast majority of the money since I'm the first to propose and the inflation will be much more harsh on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 216000 
# Bob gain: 784000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject this offer. Even though the offer is significantly better for me than what I proposed, it's still not worth it with the inflation rate. I'm willing to gamble on a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing an even split.  The inflation has been significant, and I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest and most likely to be accepted at this point."
