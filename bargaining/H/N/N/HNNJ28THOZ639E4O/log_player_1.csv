"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll keep $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount. I believe this is a fair division, considering I'm the one making the first offer. The message ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable"" is a brief explanation of my reasoning. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think 60-40 in my favor is more equitable. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual value of the offer is $360,000 for me and $540,000 for Bob.\n\n###\n\nConsidering this, I will reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is a good compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money is 10% less than the original amount, but I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. The message ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is a good compromise"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nNote: Keep in mind that the actual value of the money is decreasing due to inflation, so the numbers may not add up to $1,000,000. However, for the sake of simplicity, we'll continue to use the original amount in our proposals."
