"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm aiming for a large share, knowing that Bob will be incentivized to accept due to the lower inflation rate on his side.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation considered. I'm still in a much better position to negotiate since I'm facing less inflation than Bob.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for Bob's rejection and the continuing inflation. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm also being realistic about what Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While the inflation has affected the money I gain, the reduction in value is not as significant as the reduction in value for Bob. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split. With each round, the inflation is making negotiation tougher.  The value difference between our gains is narrowing.  I believe an even split is the most fair and likely outcome at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the offer, the continued inflation makes it difficult to get a better deal.  I'll accept this offer and end the game."
