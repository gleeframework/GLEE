"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent chunk""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to give Bob a relatively generous offer to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering we both get a decent amount. Let's end this early and avoid the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, and Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer. I'll accept Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
