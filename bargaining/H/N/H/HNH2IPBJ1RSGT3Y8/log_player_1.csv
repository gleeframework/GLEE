"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message suggesting a fair division. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also setting a benchmark for future proposals. Given the inflation mechanic affecting Bob more significantly, there's an incentive for him to consider earlier offers more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's suggestion that it's fair considering inflation, the split he's proposing is the inverse of my initial offer, which was more in his favor due to the impact of inflation on his gains. Since the money is worth the same to me across rounds but decreases in value for Bob, there's strategic value in holding out for a better offer or making a counteroffer that leverages this asymmetry. Additionally, accepting this early in the game might undervalue my position, given that I'm not yet feeling the effects of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'll adjust my offer to a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that Bob is experiencing a 20% decrease in value each round and I am not, the effective value of the money he receives is diminishing rapidly. This offer still represents a concession from my initial proposal but takes into account the strategic advantage provided by the asymmetric effects of inflation. By slightly increasing Bob's share from the previous round, I aim to make the offer more appealing while maintaining a favorable position. The message reiterates the fairness of the proposal, especially in light of the inflationary pressure Bob is under."
