Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but there's still room for negotiation. Accepting now would be settling for less than what we can likely achieve."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, we're down to the wire.  Let's split this 50/50 and avoid getting nothing at all. It's the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's risky to push further. While ideally, I'd want a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split guarantees a good amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing if Alice plays hardball till the end."
