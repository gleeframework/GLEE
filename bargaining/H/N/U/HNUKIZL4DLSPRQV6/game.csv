990000.0,10000.0,I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a fair deal.  I'll take 99% and you can have the remaining 1%. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,Your offer was a little imbalanced. Let's be fair - how about a 70/30 split?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Okay, let's try a 60/40 split. I think that's a better compromise.  Let's get this done before the inflation gets worse!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"I appreciate the compromise, but 60/40 still doesn't feel quite right. How about 65/35? We're running out of time!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take 55%, you take 45%.  We're getting close to the deadline, so let's be reasonable.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
375000.0,625000.0,"We're getting close, but I need a bit more. 62.5/37.5 is my final offer - take it or leave it. Clock's ticking!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Okay, we're down to the wire.  Let's split this 50/50 and avoid getting nothing at all. It's the best we can do at this point.",Alice,7,
