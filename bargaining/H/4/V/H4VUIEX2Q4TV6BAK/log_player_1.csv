"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
I'm going for a high initial offer to see if Bob is willing to settle for a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than getting nothing in the end, especially considering inflation will make it even harder to get a good deal in the later rounds."
