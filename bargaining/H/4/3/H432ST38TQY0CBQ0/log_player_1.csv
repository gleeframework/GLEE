Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. But let's find something a bit more equitable considering the inflation.  How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking and our money is losing value fast. I'm offering you 35% which is a better deal than you'll get in later rounds. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the time pressure, but I need a fair deal.  This offer is better for both of us in the long run. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is identical to Bob's initial offer, the inflation heavily impacts Bob's potential gains in future rounds.  Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount for Alice before inflation further erodes the value."
