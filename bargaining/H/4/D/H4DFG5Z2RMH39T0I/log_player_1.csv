"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I propose a near-even split, leaving Bob with a symbolic $1.  This maximizes my gains while demonstrating goodwill."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Although I get less than my initial proposal, the inflation means the money is worth less, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to secure a better deal in the future."
