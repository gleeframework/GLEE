{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the initial amount.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it since it's still not favorable to me. The money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so $5,500 is equivalent to $6,000 in the first round, which is still less than what I initially offered to Bob.
