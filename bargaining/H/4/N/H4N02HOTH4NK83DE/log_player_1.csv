"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that we both lose money if we wait too long.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering I lose value faster than you do. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast.  I'm taking a small hit to end this, but let's be realistic about the losses we're both facing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a bit more due to the higher inflation rate I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking into account the inflation, it's better to accept Bob's offer now. I'm losing value faster than he is, and this offer is only slightly worse than my previous proposal.  Further delays will only hurt both of us."
