Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the deal needs to be more beneficial for me considering the inflation difference. This offer still allows you to walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take a larger share while using the inflation difference as a justification. While her offer has improved slightly, it's not enough to offset the rapid devaluation Bob is facing.  It's time to push for a more significant shift in the next round."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a final offer. It's crucial we settle now before inflation erodes the value further.  This maintains a reasonable split while acknowledging the different rates we face. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting desperate, but this offer is still not acceptable.  While time is running out, folding now would mean accepting a significantly devalued amount. There's a chance to push for a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We both lose if this fails.  My offer reflects the urgency -  accept it, and we both walk away with something substantial.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is absolutely my final offer.  We're at the point where another rejection means we both lose significant sums.  Agree now, and we both benefit from a deal that recognizes the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but with the rapidly increasing inflation for Bob, waiting any longer is too risky. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives something rather than nothing if the rounds run out."
