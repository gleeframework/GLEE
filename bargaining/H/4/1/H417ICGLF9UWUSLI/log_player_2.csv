Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not be greedy. This is a strong offer considering the inflation working against us both. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer.  It's better than what we'll both get if this fails. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting risky. While the offer is not ideal, accepting it ensures some gain. Continuing to reject could lead to both of us getting nothing."
