"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for us both to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than this! The offer seems a bit one-sided, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try and get a more even split. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle to minimize inflation loss.""}\n\nSince Alice's initial offer was a bit skewed, I'm trying to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, considering the inflation rate. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in compromising to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, inflation is hitting us both. Let's settle this now. I'll take $55, you take $45. It's better than risking further losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough inflation is taking its toll, Alice's offer still doesn't seem fair to me. Given that the money is worth less with each round, I think Alice should be more willing to compromise. I'll take the risk and try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both, but I think this split is more realistic considering the devaluation.""}\n\nGiven that we're both losing value with each passing round, I'm trying to find a balance that acknowledges the impact of inflation on our potential gains. Since Alice's last offer was still a bit one-sided, I'm hoping this proposal will be seen as a more equitable solution."
