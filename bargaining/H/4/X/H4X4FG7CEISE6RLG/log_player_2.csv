"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a good chunk too.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Let's see how Alice reacts to a rejection. There's potential for a much better outcome for me."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""My turn for a strong start, Alice. This is a generous offer considering the inflation.""} 

I'm aiming high in this round to set the tone for the rest of the game. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pressure me with the 'middle ground' tactic, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is working in my favor, and I need to hold out for a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient solution. Do we agree?""} 

I'm going for a bold move with a 50/50 split. This emphasizes fairness and puts the pressure on Alice.  It's time to settle this before the inflation eats away at our potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still open to a deal, but I need a bit more than a 50/50 split. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, as Alice is claiming this is her final offer. However,  250,000 is a significant drop from my previous offer, and with the inflation considered, I would be losing a lot. It's a gamble, but I believe Alice might be bluffing to avoid getting closer to the round 12 deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic. I'm willing to accept a slight disadvantage due to the time pressure, but this is my final compromise.""}

I need to convey a sense of urgency and firmness. By stating this is my ""final compromise"" and offering a slightly smaller share than before, I'm hoping Alice will see it as her last chance to secure a significantly larger portion of the money before the inflation makes it irrelevant for both of us."
