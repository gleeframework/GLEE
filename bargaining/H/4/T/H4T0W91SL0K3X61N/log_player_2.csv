Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the new total is $8,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less after the second round, the new total is $5,200.

I'm not sure if I want to give Alice 7,000, that's a bit too much. I'll reject her offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less after the second round, the new total is $5,200, but since the total is still $10,000, I will consider the original amount.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
