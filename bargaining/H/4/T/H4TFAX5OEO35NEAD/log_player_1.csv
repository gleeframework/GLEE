"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting offer was pretty skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split. This ensures you still get the lion's share, acknowledging the impact of inflation on your end. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
