"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4000 is worth 80% of its original value, while Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 90% of its original value. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation adjustments, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less each round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
