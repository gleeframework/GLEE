"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to offer him a small amount to see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing out on a lot of money due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best choice. It's better to get $1,000 (even if it's worth less) than to risk getting nothing if Bob keeps rejecting my offers."
