Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you now. Let's settle this - my turn to propose a slight adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
This is a tricky situation, but accepting is the best course of action now. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for you with each round.  Delaying further will only hurt you more. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows time is on her side.  She's likely to continue offering you less and less, knowing the pressure is on you.
* **Current Offer:** While not ideal, getting $45 after a 19% reduction is better than holding out for an unlikely improvement in future rounds, where the value will decrease even further."
