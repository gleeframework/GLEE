"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better if we split it more evenly.  This offer accounts for your inflation, but gives me a slightly larger share since I'm taking on the risk of a further round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
