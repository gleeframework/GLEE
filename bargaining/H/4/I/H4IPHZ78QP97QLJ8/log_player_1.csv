"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to test the waters."
