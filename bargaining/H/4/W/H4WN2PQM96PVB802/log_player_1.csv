"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, but I'd rather not give up as much as I would with this offer. My gain of $5,000 is worth 5% less than my original offer, which was $8,000. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This way, I'll get a bit more, but it's still a fair split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try flipping the script from the last round. I'll take a bigger share this time, but it's still a fair deal considering the inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and my gain is worth even less now. I'm not eager to give up a larger share to Bob, but I'm willing to consider his proposal.

However, I think I can do better. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the increasing inflation. Since my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. This way, I'll get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. We're both losing money with each passing round, and we need to get this done. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll, and I'm losing value with each passing round. I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses.
