"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will make the money worth less for Bob in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I propose to take 80 dollars and give Bob 20 dollars. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm willing to concede a little, but I'm still aiming for a good portion of the money, as inflation will continue to hurt Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with inflation eroding Bob's offer further each round, I'd be foolish to risk getting nothing at all."
