I propose taking $9,000 for myself and giving $1,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount to consider while ensuring a significant gain for me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculously unfair to me.  I'm only getting $1,000, which is less than 10% of the total.  It's a terrible deal!  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my initial demand, but I still want a significant share. I'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. This is a fairer split, considering the inflation and that Bob was so unreasonable in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm not happy about it, but I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'm hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future, but for now, I'll take what I can get."
