I'm starting with a generous offer to secure a quick win, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it might seem tempting to take the 40, remember the money is worth less now due to inflation. Also, I know that Bob is losing value on his money much faster than I am. I'm willing to wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share to Bob, but still a significant amount.  I'm betting that he's feeling the pressure of inflation and will be more likely to accept this offer than the last one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to 50/50, but I'm still holding out.  The inflation is hitting him hard, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I wait a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm decreasing my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm hoping Bob is starting to feel the pressure of time and inflation, and will be more willing to accept a deal that's still favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to what I'd like, and the inflation is really starting to hurt him.  It's time to take what I can get before it gets even worse!"
