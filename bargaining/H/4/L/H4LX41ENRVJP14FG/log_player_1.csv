"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'll get the majority 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a more favorable deal for himself.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was 750,000 to 250,000, I'll try to counter with a slightly more balanced offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the 50/50 split I initially suggested, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to stick to his original plan of getting the majority of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to push for a more even split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was 600,000 to 400,000, I'll try to counter with an even more aggressive offer to push for a more balanced split. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, meet me in the middle or I'll walk away""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the previous offers, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to stick to his original plan of getting the majority of the money, but is willing to give me a slightly better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to push for an even better deal. I'm not going to accept a 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider a 50/50 split or better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was 550,000 to 450,000, I'll try to counter with a 50/50 split, which is the fairest and most balanced option. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's finally agree on a fair split, 50/50 is the way to go""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the most reasonable and equitable option. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer and we can end the game."
