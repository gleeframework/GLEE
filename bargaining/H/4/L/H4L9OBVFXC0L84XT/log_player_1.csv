"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 40% of the money, but I'm hoping you'll be willing to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to start by offering you a fair split, but I think we can both do better.  Let's try a 55/45 split.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous for me. I'd like to propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $360,000 and you getting $640,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""As we discussed, I'm willing to meet in the middle with a 60/40 split. I think this is a fair compromise, but I'm open to further negotiation if you're not satisfied.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous proposal, but I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
