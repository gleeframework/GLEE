6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair and divide the money with a 60-40 split. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we avoid losing value due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I understand you wanting a greater share, but a 55/45 split is more reflective of the risk we each face with inflation. This ensures we both benefit significantly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise. A 58-42 split is more reasonable, as I'm losing less value over time compared to you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're reaching a critical point.  I'm proposing 52/48 - it's a compromise that acknowledges the inflation difference while still being a good deal for both of us before our shares shrink further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"I understand we're both losing value, but I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. A 56-44 split is my new offer, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4950.0,5050.0,"Alice, this is it. We're both losing serious money with each round. 50/50 was never on the table for me given the inflation, but I'll take a slight hit at 50.5/49.5 just to end this now before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
