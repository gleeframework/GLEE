Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm taking a large share, but I'm willing to compromise if necessary.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Although I'm getting less money, I'm still losing a larger percentage compared to Bob.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my offer by 2000 but am still aiming for a majority share. This should be more appealing to Bob than the last round.  Let's see if he takes it."
