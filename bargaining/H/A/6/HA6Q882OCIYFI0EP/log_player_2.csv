Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  What do you say?

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split right off the bat.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. Let's see what you think.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, 60/40, but we need to move quickly. This inflation is eating away at our money! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's a good deal, especially considering the inflation. Let's take it."
