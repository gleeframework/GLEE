"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  I'm starting off with a generous offer, but I'll need to be more strategic in the future to account for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I'm getting significantly less. I'll take my chances with inflation and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 80 for myself and 20 for Bob, hoping to find a middle ground.  I need to consider the inflation and ensure I get a reasonable share while also not pushing Bob too far away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is biting into my potential gains, I'm getting a better deal than the last round, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired outcome. I'll accept this and avoid risking further inflation."
