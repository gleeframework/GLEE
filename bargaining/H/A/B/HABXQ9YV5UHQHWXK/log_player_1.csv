"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I think I deserve a bigger share, considering the original amount was 1,000,000$. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is closer to my original 50/50 proposal, but still gives Bob a slightly larger share. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 480k, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer. 480k is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair deal considering the money's value has decreased due to inflation. I'll take the 480k and call it a day!"
