"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20-80 split. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer is quite far from that. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and this offer is closer to a 50-50 split. I hope Bob will consider it and accept."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not satisfied. I think I can get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 30-70 split, and I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll aim for a more even split, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."

I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offers and Bob's demands. This offer is closer to a 40-60 split, which I hope will be more acceptable to Bob."
