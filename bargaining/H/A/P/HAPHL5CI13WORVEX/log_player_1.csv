"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting for a quick resolution, but I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest. However, since you went first, I'm willing to take the same advantage you proposed, but in my favor this time.  Let's settle this now and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
