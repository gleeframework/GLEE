"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set a good tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not accepting 60-40, let's try 70-30. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new proposal, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 30% is a fair share, especially considering the initial offer I made was already quite generous. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept this more balanced proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going all the way to 50-50. You can take 45%. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 45% split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 45% is a decent compromise, and I'd rather accept this offer than continue negotiating. I'll take the 450,000 and hope it's enough to make it worth my while!"
