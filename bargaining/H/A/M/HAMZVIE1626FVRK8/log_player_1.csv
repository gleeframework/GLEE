"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20. You get a smaller share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept quickly, while I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal yet. Meet me at 60/40, or I'll keep pushing.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share and decreasing Bob's, hoping he'll accept this offer or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money! I need to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth less, I need to be more cautious and consider the long-term implications.

However, Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get at this point, considering the inflation and the previous rejections."
