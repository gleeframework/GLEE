"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. A fair and simple start.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. He's trying to take advantage of the fact that he's making the proposal this round, and he's offering me a very small share. I think I deserve a much larger share, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I still think I deserve a bigger chunk. Let's see if you can do better next time.""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me $700,000 and Bob $300,000. I'm trying to be a bit more generous than Bob was in his offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I still think I should get more. Let's see if you can do better next time. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. Although I was hoping for a better deal, I think the 6:4 split is a decent compromise. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and I'm not sure I can do better in the next round. Plus, Bob's message suggests that he might be willing to negotiate further, so I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for future negotiations."
