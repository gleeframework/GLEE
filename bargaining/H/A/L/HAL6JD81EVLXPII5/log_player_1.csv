"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but you're still getting less than half! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, $6,000 is actually equivalent to $5,400 in the first round's value. Still a decent offer, but I'm not sure I want to settle for less than 50% of the original amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but don't think I'm getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but considering the inflation, $5,000 is worth significantly less than $5,000 in the first round. However, it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being even less valuable.
