"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not thrilled about giving up 20% of my potential gain already, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings now!

Considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer because the difference between 48 and 52 is relatively small, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round."
