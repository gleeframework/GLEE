"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give myself $700,000 and Bob $300,000. It's a pretty generous offer, considering the initial amount is $1,000,000. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the new offer.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll decide to reject this offer. The ratio of the split is quite skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% decrease in value due to inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more balanced split, with me getting 55% of the remaining value and Bob getting 45%. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer for Round 4.

With the further decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, this offer is slightly more balanced than the previous one, and it's a decent compromise.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
