"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 60% and you get 40% - a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, recognizing that we're both negotiating here.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept a 55-45 split in Bob's favor, especially since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 45% of the money. How about we meet in the middle at 52.5/47.5?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share. Let's see if this works for you?""
}
