# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, 20% less money hurts!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a better split this time. Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, I'll give you 58% and keep 42%""

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a fair 50% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a fair split now versus potentially getting a better deal later. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 50% split and get out of this inflationary nightmare!"
