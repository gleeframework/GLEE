9000.0,1000.0,"Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can negotiate more in the future, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a good starting point.",Alice,1,

3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, that's a ridiculously low starting point. Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that the money devalues faster for you, giving you a better deal in the early rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but your offer was too far off. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more reasonable starting point for negotiations.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value rapidly.  65/35 is my final offer for this round. It's a fair deal considering the devaluation rate.  Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.",Bob,4,
