"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can negotiate more in the future, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While starting with a seemingly fair negotiation might sound appealing,  Alice's devaluation of the money is much higher than mine. I need to aim for a much larger portion in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's a ridiculously low starting point. Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that the money devalues faster for you, giving you a better deal in the early rounds.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but your offer was too far off. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more reasonable starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still severely undervaluing the impact of the inflation on her end. While a 60/40 split in her favor might sound reasonable in a normal negotiation,  the rapid devaluation of the money makes this unacceptable. I need to hold strong and push for a much better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value rapidly.  65/35 is my final offer for this round. It's a fair deal considering the devaluation rate.  Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.""
