Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a ridiculously low starting point. Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that the money devalues faster for you, giving you a better deal in the early rounds. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
