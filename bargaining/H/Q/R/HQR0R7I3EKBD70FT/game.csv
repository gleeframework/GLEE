750000.0,250000.0,I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I believe a more equitable split is 55/45 in my favor. This acknowledges the diminishing value of money but also offers you a fair share.,Bob,2,
