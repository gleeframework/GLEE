**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me, Alice is still consistently offering deals where she gets a larger share. I need to hold out for a better offer, hoping she'll become more willing to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly taking advantage of my situation, but her offer is still terrible. I need to call her bluff.  With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on her to offer something more reasonable. If I accept this offer, I'm basically letting inflation steal most of my potential gains."

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I have to be realistic. With only three rounds left, the value of the money is plummeting for me. Accepting 45 dollars, even with the heavy inflation, is better than risking getting nothing at all if Alice refuses to budge."
