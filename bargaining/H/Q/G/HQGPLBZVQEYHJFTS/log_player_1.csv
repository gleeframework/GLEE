"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: $9,000 * 0.95 = $8,550
Bob's gain: $1,000 * 0.95 = $950

Considering the new offer from Bob, the actual amounts would be:

Alice's gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750
Bob's gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
