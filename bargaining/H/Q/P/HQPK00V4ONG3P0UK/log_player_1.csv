"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, I'm taking what you offered last round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let Bob know I rejected his offer. It's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit less.""}\n\nLet me know what Bob decides."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It seems like there was a misunderstanding in the instructions. Given that we are in Round 3 and it's my turn again, I will proceed with making a new offer, taking into account the inflation for both of us.\n\nFor me (Alice), the money is worth 20% less with each passing round. So, after two rounds, the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.\n\nFor Bob, the money is worth 5% less with each passing round. So, after two rounds, the money is worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value.\n\nConsidering these factors, my new proposal would aim to balance the loss due to inflation while still trying to reach a fair agreement. Let's adjust the figures to try and meet closer to a middle ground that both can accept.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Adjusting for both our losses to inflation, aiming for a mutually acceptable split.""}\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides."
