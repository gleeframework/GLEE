"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is better than the previous one, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will come up with an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""My turn again! I'll give you 35, but I need 65 to feel good about this split.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's try 40-60 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and Bob's offer seems to be taking advantage of the reduced value. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come up with a more generous proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 28, but I really need 72 to feel good about this split. It's getting tight!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's try 30-70 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a lot less now, and Bob's offer seems to be taking advantage of the extreme devaluation. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as the reduced value of the money makes 75 dollars not as attractive as it would have been earlier."
