"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and leaving $30 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amount I'll gain as 50% of the original $100, which is $50.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
