"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a bit more, but you get a good chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. How about a slightly better split for me this time?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:** The key is that the money loses value quickly for me (Bob). Holding out might seem like a good idea, but each round makes the potential winnings significantly smaller. 
* **Balancing Fairness and Urgency:** Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible. My offer is a counter that's still somewhat generous to Alice, acknowledging she likely wants a larger share. However, the slightly increased amount for me reflects the urgency of settling sooner rather than later due to inflation.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** By making a relatively reasonable counter-offer early, I signal to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a deal heavily skewed in her favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get a better deal than that last offer. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money has already lost significant value for me. Waiting any longer will only worsen the situation. 
* **Alice's Compromise:** While her offer isn't ideal, Alice has moved closer to a middle ground, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Alice proposing an even less favorable deal in the next round, where the money will be worth even less. Accepting now guarantees a decent sum, even if it's not the maximum possible."
