# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is fair, there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal, especially since the money loses value each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a slightly more balanced split. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still going to reject it. Inflation is a factor, and I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's just split it evenly. Time is ticking, and I don't want to risk losing everything due to inflation.""}
