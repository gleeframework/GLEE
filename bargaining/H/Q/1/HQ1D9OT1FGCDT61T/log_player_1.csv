"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a larger share, but it's not entirely unreasonable.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, as the inflation effect will be relatively minimal in the first few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better than the 20% less I'd get from my previous proposal, and it's a fair split.  I'll accept it."
