"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a generous offer and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not going easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $2,000, which is equivalent to 20% of the original $10,000. However, I'll have to consider that the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll calculate my gain in the original amount, which is $2,000 / 0.8 = $2,500 (since 20% less is equivalent to 0.8 times the original value).

Considering Bob's gain is $8,000, which is equivalent to 80% of the original $10,000, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 30/70""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $7,000 and keeping $3,000 for myself, hoping that he'll see it as a more reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take the last decent offer 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $1,000, which is equivalent to 10% of the original $10,000. However, I'll have to consider that the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll calculate my gain in the original amount, which is $1,000 / 0.5208 = $1,923 (since 48.8% less is equivalent to 0.5208 times the original value).

Considering Bob's gain is $9,000, which is equivalent to 90% of the original $10,000, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250,
  ""bob_gain"": 9750,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you almost all of it, just take it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $9,750 and keeping $250 for myself, hoping that he'll see it as a desperate but reasonable offer."
