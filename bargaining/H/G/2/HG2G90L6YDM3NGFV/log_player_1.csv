"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I'm hoping to get a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting! With the money worth 20% less, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $240,000.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept the 70-30 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, my gain of $240,000 is now worth $192,000. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still reasonable considering the inflation."

# Bob gain: 550000

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled, but I'll consider it. However, I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
