"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20$. I'm taking the remaining 80%. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of the original 80$, which is 64$. However, Bob's offer is to split it evenly, so I would gain 50$ and Bob would gain 50$.

I'll accept this offer.
