"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. I figure he'll be more likely to accept a smaller amount now, rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a fair split. Accepting this offer guarantees me 500,000, and given the inflation, I'm not sure I can do better in the next rounds."
