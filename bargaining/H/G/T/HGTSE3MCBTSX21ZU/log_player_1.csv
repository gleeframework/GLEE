"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced offer, considering the inflation. I'll take 45% and you can have 55%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's more fair than the initial 10% you offered me. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
