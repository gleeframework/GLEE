Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is still a significant gain for you.  Considering the inflation, it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
