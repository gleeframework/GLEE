"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to get a quick agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth $4,800 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to take $5,000, which is a bit less than what I had initially proposed. However, Bob is offering me the same amount as he's offering himself, so it's a fair split. I'll accept this offer.
