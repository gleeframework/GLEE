"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share, and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try this split - I think it's fairer, but happy to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

The new values are:
Alice gain: $4,000 (worth 90% of $4,600)
Bob gain: $6,000 (worth 95% of $6,315)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob. Let's see...

The current values are:
Alice gain: $4,000 (worth 80% of $5,000)
Bob gain: $6,000 (worth 92.5% of $6,500)

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800, which is a 58% share, and keeping $4,200 for myself, which is a 42% share."
