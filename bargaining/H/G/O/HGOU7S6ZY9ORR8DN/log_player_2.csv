"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be more fair this time. 60 for me, 40 for you. We can both benefit from this deal!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. 50/50 seems like a fair split to me. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept the 50/50 split. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
