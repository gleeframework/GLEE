"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can always try to negotiate in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more fair this time. 60 for me, 40 for you. We can both benefit from this deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and the initial amount is $100, the actual amount Bob is offering me is equivalent to $57.50 (60% of $100 * 0.95). Meanwhile, I would get $40.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50/50 seems like a fair split to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $50."
