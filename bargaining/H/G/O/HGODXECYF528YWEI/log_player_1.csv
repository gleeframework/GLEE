"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $2500 is worth 90% of $3000 (10% less than the original $3000 I would have gotten in the first round), and Bob's gain of $7500 is worth 95% of $8000 (5% less than the original $8000 he would have gotten in the first round).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think this is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk as well. It's a good compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $2000 is worth 67.9% of $3000 (27.1% less than the original $3000 I would have gotten in the first round), and Bob's gain of $8000 is worth 85.71% of $9350 (14.26% less than the original $10,000).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is still trying to take a larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation, my gain is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a stronger stance and get a larger share, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet! I'll take a big share, but I'll give you a small consolation prize. It's my last offer, so think carefully! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my gains!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $1000 is worth 33.33% of $3000 (40.95% less than the original $3000 I would have gotten in the first round), and Bob's gain of $9000 is worth 90% of $10,000 (22.62% less than the original $10,000).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.
