"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge since I'm proposing. Let's make it even. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
