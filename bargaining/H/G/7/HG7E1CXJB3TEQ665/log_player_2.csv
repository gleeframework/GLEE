Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a strong offer considering the inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Value:** With each round, the money loses significant value for Bob. Accepting $400,000 now, even if seemingly low, might be better than risking a worse offer later and ending up with even less. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her message suggests she's firm on this offer. Rejecting it might lead to her offering even less in subsequent rounds, especially if she senses desperation on Bob's part.
* **Time Pressure:**  Only 7 rounds remain.  Holding out hope for a drastically better offer is risky, considering Alice is also aware of the diminishing value and might be willing to gamble on Bob caving in later. 

While the split isn't perfect, accepting avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.
