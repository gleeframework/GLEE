"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $1,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point. It's fair and gives us both a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than a 45% share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
