"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get some money instead of risking going to 0."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more even split! 

I'll consider it, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to split it so evenly. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
