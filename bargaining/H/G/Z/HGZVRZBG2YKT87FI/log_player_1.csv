"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I'll accept Bob's offer.
