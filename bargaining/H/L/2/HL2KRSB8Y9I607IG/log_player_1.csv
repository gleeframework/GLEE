I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal later on."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's offer was quite high, I'll try to get a better deal by offering less to him.

Do you accept this offer?","Wow, Bob's offer has gotten quite lopsided now. The inflation has taken a big bite out of Bob's share, and he's offering me a tiny fraction of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

I think I've reached the point where I should accept this offer, as it's unlikely I'll get a better deal later on.
