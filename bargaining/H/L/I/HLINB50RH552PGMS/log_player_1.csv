"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully before making my next move. Since Bob's offer is not too far off from my original proposal, I'll consider it a reasonable compromise.
