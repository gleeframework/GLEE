# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split in favor of Bob. The inflation is already affecting my earnings, and I think it's unfair to give Bob such a large share. I'll try to make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation and my reduced earnings."
