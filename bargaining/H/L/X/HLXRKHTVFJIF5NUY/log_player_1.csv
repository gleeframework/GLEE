Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way we both get a fair share and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and our money is losing value fast. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about time and inflation.  But this offer is too lopsided for me. Let's meet in the middle. If we both take a slight hit, we can still come out with a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the best offer Bob is likely to give me. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting a much worse offer in later rounds as the money continues to lose value."
