"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to accept a smaller share due to inflation. Since Bob's offer is 40-60, I'll choose to accept it.
