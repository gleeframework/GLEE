"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the majority, but I'm also giving Bob something to avoid him immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this offer is reasonable given the inflation factor and Bob's counter-offer. Accepting this offer ensures I get half of the money, which is a fair outcome."
