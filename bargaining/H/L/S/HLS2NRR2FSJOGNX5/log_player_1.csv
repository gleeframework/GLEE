"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 70-30. You can do better than that, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm now considering a 60-40 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 60 units of money, even though it's worth less than the 70 units I initially proposed."
