"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly. This offer gives me a good gain, and you'll still get something.  With each round, the money is worth less for both of us, especially you! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount, especially considering that the value of the money decreases by 5% for me with each round. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need to account for the loss of value on my end. This is a more balanced offer considering my situation.""}\n\nSince the value of the money decreases by 5% for me with each round, I want to make an offer that takes this into account. I'll offer Alice 40% of the total amount, which is still generous but allows me to mitigate the loss of value on my end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out!  This is my final offer. It gives me a good share while still leaving you with a decent amount. If you refuse, we both risk ending up with even less. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current situation, where the money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, I still find Alice's offer of 35% to be too low. Considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I believe I can propose a better division that accounts for this loss in value. I will reject this offer and make another proposal in the next round, aiming to find a more balanced share that considers my specific situation with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the significant loss of value on my end due to inflation, I'm making a serious compromise by offering you 45%. This is a fair adjustment that reflects the urgency and the impact of inflation on my share. I believe this is a reasonable offer that should be acceptable to both of us, especially given the circumstances.""}\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth even less due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer to ensure I'm not losing too much value over time. By offering Alice 45% and taking 55% for myself, I'm trying to strike a balance that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money for me while still being fair to Alice. This offer also shows that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution."
