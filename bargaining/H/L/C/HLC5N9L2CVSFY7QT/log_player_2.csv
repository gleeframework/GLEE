"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's a generous offer for the first round, I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the money depreciates each round.  I'll see what I can propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I believe this split is fairer, given we both have an equal chance to propose in the future. Let's work together to get the most out of this opportunity.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your previous offer significantly undervalues my position in the early rounds. This offer is a compromise, and I believe it's fair considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the risk of getting nothing is high with more rounds. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent portion of the money."
