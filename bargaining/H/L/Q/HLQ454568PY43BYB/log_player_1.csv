Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, leaving Bob with just $1. I figure, if he's smart, he'll accept this in the first round. There's no guarantee that the inflation will be in my favor, so it's best to secure the lion's share quickly.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is fair. While I still believe I could get more, it's too risky to keep rejecting offers.  The inflation might not be in my favor, and I could end up with less than $500,000 if we keep going.  It's better to take the guaranteed half."
