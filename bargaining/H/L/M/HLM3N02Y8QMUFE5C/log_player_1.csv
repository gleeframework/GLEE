Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
