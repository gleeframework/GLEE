  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still quite biased towards him, but I'll consider it.

However, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.
