Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after 1 round (100 - 20% = 80%), I'll make an offer that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully before making a decision.
