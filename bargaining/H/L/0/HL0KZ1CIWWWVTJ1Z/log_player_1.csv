"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share since I'm making the first offer.""}

I'm proposing that I get 8000 and Bob gets 2000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money will lose value with each round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 4000 and hope that Bob will be more generous in the future rounds."
