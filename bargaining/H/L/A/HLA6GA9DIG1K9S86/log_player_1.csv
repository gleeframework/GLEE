"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, my gain of 500,000 is actually worth 400,000 in real terms, and Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 475,000.

I'm not sure I like this offer, as it seems unfair to me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, which I think is a good compromise given the current situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the real value of the gains considering the inflation:

My gain of 475,000 is worth 515,000 in real terms (1,000,000 * 0.8^3 * 0.9526), and Bob's gain of 525,000 is worth 525,000 in real terms (1,000,000 * 0.8^3 * 0.8557).

It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'm not willing to accept this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000
}
```

This is a 52.5-47.5 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the current situation."
