"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While a 10% share is better than nothing, I think we can still find a more equitable split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer, reflecting the fact that I've been willing to negotiate, and I believe it's a good starting point for finding a solution we can both agree on."
