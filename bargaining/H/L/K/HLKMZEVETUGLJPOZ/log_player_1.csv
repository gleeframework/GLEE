"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a decent chunk to start, but I'm hoping to get a good deal in the next rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not going to give you the upper hand so easily. My offer is a fair starting point, but I'm ready to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth 90% of the original $8,000 I proposed, which is $7,200, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 95% of the original $6,400, which is $5,800.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to accept it for now.
