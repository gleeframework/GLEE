"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. If Bob accepts, we can end the game and collect our shares. If he declines, I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate further if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
