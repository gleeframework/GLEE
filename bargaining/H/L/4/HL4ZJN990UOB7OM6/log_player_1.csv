"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the initial $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, as it accounts for the fact that we're both losing money with each round.  Let's finish this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth less due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this split is fair, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time around."
