"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a generous 30% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 300,000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 285,000$ in today's value.

I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
