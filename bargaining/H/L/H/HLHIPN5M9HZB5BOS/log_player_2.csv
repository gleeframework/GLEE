"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the value decreases faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair initially, the fact that the money depreciates at a faster rate for her means I can likely negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Since the value is decreasing faster for you, Alice, I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair amount.  Let's split it this way and end this game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation, but so do you. This is my final offer, let's end this now and both get something reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the money is losing value rapidly. Alice's offer is still reasonable, and accepting it ensures I get something before the value decreases even further."
