"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives me $4000, but I think I can get more. The 5% inflation rate per round means I'll lose some value, but I'm willing to take that risk for a potentially better deal.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round where I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. It's a fair compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nI've considered the inflation rate, and I'm willing to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. This offer gives me a bit more than the initial proposal, while still being reasonable for Alice. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we switch it around? 55/45 in your favor seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's new offer seems to take inflation into account by switching the percentages in my favor, the actual amount I'd receive ($4500) is less than what I offered myself in the previous round ($5500) due to the effects of inflation. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let's continue to the next round where I can make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's do 58/42.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'm increasing my proposed share to compensate for the loss. This offer is slightly more in my favor, but I believe it's still reasonable and might be acceptable to Alice, considering we're already a few rounds in and the pressure of the 12-round limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. I'll be generous and offer you 4800.  Take it before it gets any worse. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where the money I gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, Alice's offer of $4800 starts to look more appealing. Considering the decreasing value of the money with each passing round and the risk of ending up with nothing if we reach the 12-round limit without an agreement, I think it's wise to accept this offer. It's a strategic decision to secure a reasonable amount now rather than gamble for more in subsequent rounds, where the inflation could significantly reduce the value of any potential gains."
