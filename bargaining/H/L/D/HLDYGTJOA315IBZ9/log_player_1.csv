"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving Bob with 40%, which is $4,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the reminder about inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* My gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original $6,000 I could have gotten in Round 1, since it's 20% less.
* Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $5,250 he could have gotten in Round 1, since it's 5% less.

Given the reduced values, I'm not as excited about the 50-50 split as I was initially. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on 55-45, a slight tilt towards me""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 52-48 is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual values:

* My gain of $5,200 is worth 86.67% of the original $6,000 I could have gotten in Round 1, since it's 13.33% less.
* Bob's gain of $4,800 is worth 92.31% of the original $5,200 he could have gotten in Round 1, since it's 7.69% less.

Given the reduced values, I think Bob's offer is more reasonable now. I'll accept the offer.
