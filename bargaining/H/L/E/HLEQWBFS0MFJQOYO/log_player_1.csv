"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the risk of inflation. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not thrilled about giving him 60% of the money, especially since he thinks a 60-40 split in his favor is fair. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, and 20% less than in the second round. I'll have to be even more cautious.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping some value for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think a 65-35 split is a fair reflection of the inflation risk. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With my gain worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Considering Bob's proposal, a 65-35 split is even more unfavorable to me than before. I'm not sure if I can afford to give him such a large share, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects him.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll have to take a chance on this offer.
