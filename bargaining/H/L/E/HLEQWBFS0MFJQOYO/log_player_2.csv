{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While 4000 is a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's higher than my previous offer, it's still less than the 6000 I was aiming for. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
