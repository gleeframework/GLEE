"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $40, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The risk of inflation makes me want to hold out for a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  We both have a good chance of getting more in the end if we keep playing, but this is a good middle ground that accounts for the risk of inflation.""
