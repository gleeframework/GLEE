"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept or want to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $500,000 x 0.95 = $475,000
* Bob gain: $500,000 x 0.95 = $475,000

I'll accept this offer. It's a 50-50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
