"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Bob. This offers a fair compromise considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is generous, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Bob loses 10% of the value of the money with each round, while Alice loses 20%. This means that Bob has a greater incentive to hold out for a better deal in the hope that Alice's offer will become more favorable in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While this is a more favorable deal for me, it still accounts for the diminishing value of money, especially for you. Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement and avoid further losses due to inflation.""
