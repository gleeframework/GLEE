"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point, in my opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60%. It's a fair offer, considering inflation is hitting us hard, not you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'm effectively getting 40% of $10,000, while Bob is getting 60% of $8,000 (since $10,000 is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
