"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it closer to 55/45, with me getting the larger share. It's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 45 is worth 5% less than the 60 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's a slightly worse deal for me.

However, Bob's gain of 55 is worth 10% less than the 40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is a bigger hit for him.

Given the new numbers, I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
