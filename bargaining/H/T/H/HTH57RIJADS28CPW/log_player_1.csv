"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial 100$ (80$) and Bob gets 20% (20$)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, the actual values are:

* Alice's gain: 80 * 0.8 = 64
* Bob's gain: 20 * 0.8 = 16

Now, Bob's offer in the second round is:

* Alice's gain: 50
* Bob's gain: 50

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not. Considering the decrease in value due to inflation, I think this is a good opportunity to get a fair share. I'll accept Bob's offer.
