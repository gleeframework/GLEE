Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing that Bob will only get the full 100% if he rejects and we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's in my best interest to accept this offer. Although I'm getting less than I initially wanted, the inflation is making the money worth less with each passing round. Accepting a 50/50 split is a fair and secure way to get some money without risking getting nothing in the next round."
