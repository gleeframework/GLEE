Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
