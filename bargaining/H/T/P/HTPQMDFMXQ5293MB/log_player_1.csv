"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but leaves Bob with something, making it potentially appealing in the first round. I'll see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but it's still only 50% of the remaining value for me, given the 20% inflation. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to 6000, which is still a large chunk of the remaining value after inflation.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than the 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not worth it.  The inflation has significantly devalued my share. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With inflation hitting hard, I'm going for a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option at this point, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
