"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering the inflation rates. Let's close the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and give Bob 40% ($400,000). I've included a message to persuade Bob to accept the offer, highlighting that it's a fair deal given the inflation rates. Since the money loses value over time, especially for me (20% loss per round), I want to close the deal quickly. I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in this proposal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a fair split, given the inflation rates. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. With a 20% decrease in value for me and only a 10% decrease for Bob, I'm at a disadvantage if we prolong the game. However, accepting 45% of the money ($450,000) seems too low, especially considering my initial proposal was for 60%. I'll take the risk and make another proposal in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and account for the inflation loss. This is a reasonable compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take 52.5% of the money ($525,000) and give Bob 47.5% ($475,000). Given the inflation rates and the fact that we've both had a chance to make an offer, I believe this is a fair compromise. Meeting in the middle and slightly adjusting for the inflation loss I incur seems like a reasonable approach. I've included a message to convey this reasoning to Bob, hoping he'll see the logic and accept this proposal."
