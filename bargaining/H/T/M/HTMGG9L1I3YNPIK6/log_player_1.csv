I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a significant advantage, but it's important to remember that the value of the money will decrease with each round.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant change from the previous round. While I'm getting a smaller share, it's still a significant amount of money. However, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the distribution, especially considering the decreasing value of money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, acknowledging the decreasing value of the money. I believe this is a fair deal that accounts for the inflation and gives Bob a reasonable share."
