Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can split it more fairly. Let's aim for a more even distribution. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is just a reversal of my initial offer, and now it comes with the downside of the money being worth less due to inflation. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
