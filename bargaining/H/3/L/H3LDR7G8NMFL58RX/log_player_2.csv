Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the offer, I'll make a new proposal. I'll try to get as much as possible, considering the 20% inflation that will occur in each round. Here's my offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Alice's offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, since I would have gained less in real value. I'll accept her offer.
