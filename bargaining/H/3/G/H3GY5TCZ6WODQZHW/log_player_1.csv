I'm offering Bob a small amount to ensure he accepts in the first round.  It's a good starting point, and with the inflation, I'll be able to get more in the next round if he rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept now. The inflation means my gains will keep decreasing, and I'm not sure how Bob is affected by it. A 500,000$ gain is still a good outcome."
