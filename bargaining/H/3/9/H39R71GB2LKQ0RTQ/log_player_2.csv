"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, Bob.  I get $6000, you get $4000. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit too tilted in your favor. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55/45 split.  This accounts for the inflation while still being a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's compromise. I'll come down a bit from my previous offer. How about a 52/48 split? That accounts for the inflation impacting me while still giving us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still advantageous to me to hold out a little longer.  The inflation is impacting her more significantly with each round, making her more likely to offer a better deal as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you coming down a bit.  Let's settle this - I propose a 58/42 split.  It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and the inflation working against you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly down the middle - 50/50.  It's the fairest option, and we don't want to risk running out of time with this inflation! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is finally agreeing to a 50/50 split, which is the fairest outcome. While I might have been able to squeeze out a slightly better deal in later rounds, the risk of losing everything to inflation is too great. Accepting this offer guarantees a fair share of the money."
