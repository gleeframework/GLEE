"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we don't know each other's preferences yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable approach, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
