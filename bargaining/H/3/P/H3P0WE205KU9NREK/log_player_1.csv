"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the potential for a better offer from Bob in the next round."
