"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give away the farm just yet. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is not very good for Bob. Even though it's a ""decent chunk"", it's likely that Alice will offer something better in later rounds, especially if she doesn't get a response she likes.  It's better to see what other offers are possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly. Let's work together to get a good deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said you wanted to split it fairly, but I think you're being too generous. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is starting to hurt. It's important to keep pushing for a better deal, even though she's clearly not happy with Bob's previous offer.  Bob should try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. Inflation is affecting us both, so it's in our best interest to work together to secure a decent amount before it gets worse.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still worse than the initial one, and the inflation is getting out of hand. Bob should continue to push for a better deal, especially since Alice is clearly willing to compromise. He can try to propose a more even split in the next round, emphasizing the impact of inflation on both of them."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both. Let's be reasonable and split the money 55/45. This way, we both get a decent amount before the value drops further."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, considering the inflation is eating away at the value. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is steadily worsening, and the inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. Even though she claims it's her ""final offer"", it's still significantly less than what Bob would have received in earlier rounds. There are only a few rounds left, and it's crucial to hold out for a more equitable split.  It's better to risk getting nothing than accept such a low offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""We're running out of time, and inflation is eroding the value of the money rapidly. Let's be practical and split the money evenly. It's the best we can do at this point.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to give up now. I think I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, and the inflation is making it worse.  While it's tempting to accept something at this point,  it's better to keep fighting for a fairer deal. With only a few rounds left, there's still a chance to get a better offer.  Bob should try to negotiate a higher share in the next round, reminding Alice that they both risk getting nothing if they don't reach an agreement."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""We're down to the wire. Let's be reasonable and split the money 45/55. This way, we both get something before the value of the money drops even further. It's a better deal than what we have now, and it prevents us from losing everything.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm not going to give up now. Take it, or we'll both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is incredibly bad, and the inflation is nearing a critical point.  Even though she's threatening to walk away, Bob should hold out for a better deal.  There's only one round left, and accepting this offer would result in a huge loss for Bob. It's better to risk getting nothing and see if Alice will change her mind in the final round."

{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""This is our last chance. We're both losing money with every passing minute. Let's be reasonable and split the money 40/60. It's a fair compromise that allows us to secure a significant amount before it's all gone.""
