"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Let's see what kind of offer Alice will come up with in the next round!  I think I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better if we split it more evenly. Let's try this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. I'll take this offer, as the inflation is starting to take its toll."
