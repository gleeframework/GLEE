4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 5500/4500, and avoid the inflation penalty. This way we both get a decent share, and we don't have to risk losing more in the next round.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  Inflation is hurting us both. I'll take a slight edge at $5200, leaving you with $4800.  This is a fair deal considering we're losing money every round.",Alice,3,
