# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, you get a decent share. We can work from here. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  While 100,000 is a decent starting point, I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start, and we can both get a good amount.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a larger share.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than the first, I still believe we can find a more balanced split. I'll see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to move closer to your last offer, but I think a 450/550 split is more fair considering the inflation. Let's try to be reasonable and come to an agreement.""
