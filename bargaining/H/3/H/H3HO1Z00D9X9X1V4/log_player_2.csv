"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice's initial offer was 90 for her and 10 for me, I'll try to increase my share. However, I also need to consider the inflation factor, so I'll offer a slightly lower amount to make it more attractive to Alice.
