"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate for a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing Bob's gains, I'll have to be more cautious. However, 80% of 80 is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
