Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split the money a bit more evenly this time, with me taking slightly more since I'm making the offer. We'll still both get a good share and we'll avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
