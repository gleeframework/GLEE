"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get $60 and Bob will get $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that he's taking a risk by rejecting my offer. I think the split should be based on the current state of the game, not on hypothetical risks.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
