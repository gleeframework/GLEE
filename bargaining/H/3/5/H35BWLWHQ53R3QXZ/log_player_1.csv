I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to start. This is a strategy to see if he's willing to take a small cut now or risk getting less later as the money loses value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  It's true he's offering me more than I offered him, but it's still a very small amount. I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal, especially since inflation is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Bob's money is losing value, so he may be more inclined to accept a slightly better offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering me significantly more than before, I'm still going to reject it. Inflation is heavily affecting him, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}

I'm increasing my offer again, but still maintaining a substantial portion of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will start to feel the pressure of the increasing inflation and accept this offer."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  Although he's offering me more than in the previous round, it's still a very small share of the money. I believe I can get a better deal, especially since inflation is working in my favor and Bob's money is losing value quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but not too much. Bob's money is losing value rapidly, and he might be desperate to accept anything at this point.  I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money before the inflation becomes too severe."
