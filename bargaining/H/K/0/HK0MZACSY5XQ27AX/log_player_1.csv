"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to find a sweet spot. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95

I'm trying to get a larger share of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant portion. Let's see if he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more extreme offer this time, to see if Bob will accept it. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```

I'm going for a big share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a small portion. Let's see if he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 95,
  ""bob_gain"": 5

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round, and Bob is trying to take all the money for himself. I'll reject this offer and make it clear that I'm not going to let him get away with it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Since I've rejected the offer, the game is now over, and neither of us will get any money. It looks like we've played a game of ultimatum bargaining, and neither of us was willing to compromise enough to reach a deal."
