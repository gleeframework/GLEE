Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is a bit more skewed towards him. I'll think about it...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:
