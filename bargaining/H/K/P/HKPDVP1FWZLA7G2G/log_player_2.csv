**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer will only result in a smaller reward for both of us.
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been slowly moving towards a more even split. Rejecting this offer might push her to be more aggressive in future rounds. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases if we don't reach an agreement soon.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk losing everything by being too greedy."
