Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, meet me in the middle. We're both losing money here. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly. While a 50/50 split seems unlikely at this point, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal than 44/56, even with the impact of inflation.  We're approaching the halfway point, so the pressure is on for her to make a more compelling offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and the money is shrinking. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below 55%. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a critical factor. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, accepting ensures we both receive something before inflation eats away at the value further. It's a less than ideal outcome, but better than walking away with nothing if we continue to deadlock."
