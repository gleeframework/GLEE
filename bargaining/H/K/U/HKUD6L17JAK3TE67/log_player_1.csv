"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. I think this is the fairest way to go about it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $8,000 is now worth $6,400.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest way to go, considering the initial proposal I made. However, I'm willing to consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my gain of $6,400 is now worth $5,120.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to my initial proposal. Let's see if you agree.""
}
