"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $6000 and Bob receiving $4000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to take that into account when considering Bob's offer. Let's calculate the effective value of the money I would gain if I accept Bob's offer. 5000 * 0.95 = 4750. So, the effective value of the money I would gain is $4750.\n\nConsidering this, I will respond with {""decision"": ""reject""}. I believe I can get a better offer in the next round, or I can try to negotiate a more favorable split. Let's see what happens next! \n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI have considered Bob's offer from the previous round and decided to make a counteroffer. Given that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and 10% less than the initial value, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly. I am offering a 58-42 split, with me receiving $5800 and Bob receiving $4200. I included the message ""Meet me in the middle"" to convey that I am willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money I gain, I have decided to accept Bob's offer. The effective value of the $4000 I would gain is approximately $3097, taking into account the 22.62% decrease in value due to inflation. While this is not an ideal outcome, I believe it is better than risking further devaluation of the money or potentially getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12-round limit. By accepting this offer, I can ensure a certain gain, albeit a reduced one. Let's conclude the game with this agreement."
