Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further."
