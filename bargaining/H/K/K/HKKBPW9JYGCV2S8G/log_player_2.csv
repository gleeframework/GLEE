"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: My patience wears thin, take this or wait 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This back and forth is pointless. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the pot is only getting smaller for us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now I want more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal this bad sets a terrible precedent. I need to show I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get a semi-decent amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""It's clear you're aiming to take advantage, but dragging this out hurts us both.  This is my final offer.  Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  It's round 6, and the value for me is decreasing significantly with each round. A decision needs to be made soon.
* **Finality:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She knows if she rejects this, I'm likely to reject anything she offers in the next round, leading to a worse outcome for both of us.
* **Slight Compromise:**  While 48/52 is less than ideal, it's still better than her previous offer and recognizes the reality of the diminishing returns due to inflation."
