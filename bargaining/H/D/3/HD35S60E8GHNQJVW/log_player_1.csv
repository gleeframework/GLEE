Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, the value decays rapidly for you.  I propose a 75/25 split. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
