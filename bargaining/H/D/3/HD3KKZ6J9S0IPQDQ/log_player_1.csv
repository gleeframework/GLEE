"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'm actually getting 36 dollars (40 x 0.9) and Bob is getting 54 dollars (60 x 0.9).

I'll accept Bob's offer.
