Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Inflation is hitting me harder! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  With each round, the value diminishes significantly for both of us, but especially for her. It's time to push for a more agreeable split before the money is practically worthless."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split. Let's end this before the inflation eats away any more of our potential gains.  Agree now, and we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. The longer we wait, the less we both gain. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this juncture. It sends a clear message that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but not willing to be taken advantage of. It also puts the pressure on Alice, as a rejection at this point would clearly demonstrate that she is being unreasonable given the rapidly diminishing returns."
