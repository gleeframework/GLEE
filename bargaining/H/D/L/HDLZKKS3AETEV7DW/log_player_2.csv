Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with inflation eating into the potential gains, Alice's offer is getting worse. Holding out for a slightly more equitable split in the next round is still worth the risk."
