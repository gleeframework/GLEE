"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was unfair. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made no sense for Bob to accept a 40/60 split in the very first round.
* **Countering with a better split:** Bob's offer of 55/45 is still in his favor but is closer to a 50/50 split, making it more likely Alice will consider it. 
* **Factor of Inflation:**  While not drastic in this round, Alice's share is theoretically worth less with each passing round due to the 20% inflation. This gives Bob a slight advantage in negotiations as the game progresses.
* **Message:**  The message is firm but not aggressive. It acknowledges Alice's previous offer and positions Bob's counter-offer as a fairer alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think 48-52 is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Split:** Alice's offer now gives Bob the larger share of the money (52%). 
* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is starting to significantly affect the value of Alice's potential gains.  She's likely feeling the pressure to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could try to push for an even larger share in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Alice would agree. Accepting this offer guarantees a win for Bob with a larger sum than his initial counter-offer."
