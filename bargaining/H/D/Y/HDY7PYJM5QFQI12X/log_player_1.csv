"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}

I'm offering Bob 250,000$ and keeping 750,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share now, but I'm willing to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll keep the same value in mind, but for Bob, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round.

Considering this, I'll calculate the actual values:

* My gain: 200,000$
* Bob's gain: 640,000$

I'll reject this offer, as I think I can do better than that.
