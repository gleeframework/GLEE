"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can reassess later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of $4000, which is $3600, and Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of $6000, which is $4800.

I'm not thrilled with the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $5500, which is now worth 70% of $5500 due to inflation, or $3850. Bob's gain of $4500 is worth 80% of $4500, or $3600."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4800 is worth 72.9% of the original $10,000, which is $7200 / 0.729 = $988.89 (but due to the 27.1% reduction, it's actually worth $7200 * 0.713 = $5130.60).

Bob's gain of $5200 is worth 52% of the original $10,000, which is $5200 / 0.520 = $1000 (but due to the 48.8% reduction, it's actually worth $5200 * 0.520 = $2704).

I'm not thrilled with the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept this offer.
