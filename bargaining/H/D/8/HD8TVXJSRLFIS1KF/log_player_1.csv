Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but not quite in our mutual best interest.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Remember, the value decreases significantly for you with each round. It's best we settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
