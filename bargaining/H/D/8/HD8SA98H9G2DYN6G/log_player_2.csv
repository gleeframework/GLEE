Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We've both lost some value due to inflation, so a 50/50 split seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
