"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 6,000 and Bob gets 4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. 55-45 seems like a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by inflation.
