"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm feeling greedy.  I'm going to try to get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I think 70-30 is a fairer split.  After all, I'm the one taking the risk of inflation! ðŸ˜‰""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70-30 is too extreme. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm taking Alice's offer. While 58-42 isn't my dream scenario, the risk of inflation is real, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
