"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a new proposal.

I'm not sure if this offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'll think about it...

I decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
