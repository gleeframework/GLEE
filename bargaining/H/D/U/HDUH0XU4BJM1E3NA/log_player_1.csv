"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money, and Bob 10%. It's a very aggressive proposal, but given the inflation factor, it's worth seeing if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than nothing, it's still a significant loss compared to my initial proposal. It's clear Bob is aiming for a much larger share of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

While the inflation hurts, I'm still willing to offer a decent amount to Bob. This offer gives him 30% of the money, which is a good deal considering the inflation rate and his previous offer. I'm hoping this is enough to convince him to accept and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Unfortunately, the inflation has severely diminished the value of my potential gains. Accepting Bob's offer is a significant loss, but it's better than risking further inflation and potentially ending up with nothing."
