"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 50$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of 50$ is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, but I'll assume it is.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to accept the 50/50 split. It's a fair meeting in the middle, and I don't see any reason to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
