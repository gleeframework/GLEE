Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot.  While getting $43 is better than nothing, I still think holding out for a better deal is worthwhile for a couple more rounds. The inflation is hurting, but my offers are getting closer to what Alice seems to find acceptable."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me!  While I'd prefer a larger share, waiting any longer will likely result in even less favorable offers from Alice. It's time to cut my losses and take the $44 before it dwindles even further."
