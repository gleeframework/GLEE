"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50 split is the most equitable way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
