"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small amount. This should hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round, preventing any inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even with the 10% inflation, I'm still better off waiting for the next round. I'll be able to propose a more favorable deal for myself, and since the game is about maximizing our gains, it's in my best interest to continue."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer lowers my share slightly from the first round, but it's still a good starting point given the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's better to accept now than risk getting even less in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer seems tempting due to the high inflation, I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing the game. Bob's offer would leave me with $2000, whereas the previous round offered me $8000,  meaning I would be losing out significantly.  This round's offer might be my best chance to get a higher payout for myself if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This offer further decreases my share, but I still believe it's the most beneficial for me in this round. I'm hoping Bob will see that accepting this offer is better than facing even more significant inflation in the following rounds. I'm also banking on him being somewhat reasonable and not wanting to push this game to the end where both of us will get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation is significant, I still believe I can get a more favorable deal in the next round. I'm aiming to secure a larger portion of the remaining money, and I'm willing to take the risk of waiting.  My goal is to maximize my share, and I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I believe this is still the most beneficial offer I can make in this round. The inflation is becoming increasingly significant, and I need to strike a balance between maximizing my gains and avoiding a situation where we both get nothing. This offer should still be attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Despite the significant inflation, I still believe I can secure a better deal. Bob's offer would give me $4000, while my previous offer would have given me $6000. The risk of getting nothing is increasing, but I'm willing to gamble for a larger share. I believe I can influence Bob to accept a more favorable deal for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We are very close to the end of the game.  I am offering a 50/50 split. This offer is fair and gives us both a chance to get a decent amount of money.  I am hoping that Bob will see the value in a fair split, rather than risking getting nothing."
