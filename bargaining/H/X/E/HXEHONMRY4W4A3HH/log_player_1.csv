"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a very aggressive opening move, designed to force Bob to accept or risk getting nothing if he rejects and the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting.  It's better to take half than nothing!"
