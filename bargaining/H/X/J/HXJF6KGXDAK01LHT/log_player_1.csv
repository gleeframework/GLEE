"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. I'm not being too generous, I'm just trying to be fair. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of money due to inflation, and I'm trying to meet Bob halfway. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a taste of your own medicine! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation! My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not falling for Bob's trap. I know the value of the money is decreasing, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that's even less favorable than my previous one. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to be fair, 50/50 is the way to go!""
}

# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take control of the negotiations! My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not backing down, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that's even more skewed in Bob's favor. I'll keep pushing for a better deal, even if it means waiting for a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
 ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, let's find a middle ground!""

# Bob gain: 675000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze every last penny out of me! My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of my desperation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal, even if it means waiting for a few more rounds. I'm not willing to accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in Bob's favor."

 ""message"": ""It's time to split it down the middle, no more games!""
}
```

I'm going back to my previous offer from Round 5, a 50/50 split. I'm hoping that Bob will see reason and accept this fair proposal, especially since the money is worth even less now due to inflation."
