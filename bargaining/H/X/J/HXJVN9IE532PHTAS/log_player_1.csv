**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Bob is experiencing significant devaluation of his potential gains with each round. This puts pressure on him to settle.
* **Offer Improvement:** Bob has moved closer to a more even split, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of Further Rounds:** If we reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might become even more desperate and offer a less favorable split, hoping we'll crack under the pressure. 

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a much worse deal later."
