I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will benefit Bob more in later rounds."

I'll accept this offer. Even though the inflation is affecting Bob more, I'm getting a decent amount, and it's better than the risk of getting nothing with more rounds."
