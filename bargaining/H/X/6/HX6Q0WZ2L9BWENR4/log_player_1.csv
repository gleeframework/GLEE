"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60, you get 40. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we both lose value over time. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 32 (60% of 40) and Bob's gain of 60 is now worth 57 (95% of 60). I'm not satisfied with this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 24 (60% of 40) and Bob's gain is worth 55.5 (95% of 60). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer. Take it or leave it.""
