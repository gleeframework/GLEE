This is a pretty standard offer in the first round. It's a 60/40 split, which is a decent starting point.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a great offer for me! I'm getting 5000 dollars, and while it's worth 20% less than the first round, it's still a fair amount.  Plus, if I reject it, I'm going to have to offer him a bigger chunk of the pie, and his money will be worth less than mine each round!"
