Alice's offer:

""bob_gain"": 5500,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  Your offer didn't account for the fact that the money devalues faster for you.  This is a counter-offer closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is still beneficial for you considering the devaluation rates.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but time is running out! I need you to acknowledge the devaluation difference. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean I lose significantly more to inflation than Alice gains. I need to hold out for a slightly better deal.  The next round is crucial, and I might need to make a significant concession to avoid getting nothing."
