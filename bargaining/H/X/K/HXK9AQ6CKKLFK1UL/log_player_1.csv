"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 20% of the total. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we have limited rounds. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 60/40 split is indeed a more aggressive proposal than I initially expected. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much more than I initially proposed.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see a more balanced offer. Can you meet me in the middle at 55/45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 90% of its original value now.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. 55/45 seems like a fair compromise. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 52/48. This is a good compromise, and we need to start getting closer to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 52/48 split is indeed a more reasonable compromise. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to an agreement.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. 52/48 seems like a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer. Let's split it 52/48.""
}
```"
