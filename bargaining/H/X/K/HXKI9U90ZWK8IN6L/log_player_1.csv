This is a tough one!  Here's why I'm accepting, even though it's not ideal:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The money is losing value for me *fast*.  Waiting any longer means I'll be getting even less of the original amount.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems unlikely to budge much further.  He's got the advantage and knows the longer we wait, the better it is for him.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While $4,000 is much less than I wanted, it's better than holding out, potentially getting nothing, and having it be worth even less due to ""inflation""."
