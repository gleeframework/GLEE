Let's start fair! 5000 for each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll offer 4500 for myself, and 5500 for Bob. This way, I'm getting a bit more than in round 1, and Bob gets a bit more than he offered in round 2. Hopefully, this can lead to a compromise."
