"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair start, and I'm hoping he'll accept quickly so we can avoid the inflation that comes with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the initial offer was a bit low 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a bit. Considering the initial offer was indeed a bit low, I'm willing to meet him halfway. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm willing to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less now, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not leaving too much on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer, and I need to be more strategic. I'm not sure I want to give Bob a higher share than me, but I don't want to reject the offer and risk losing even more value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can finally divide the money."
