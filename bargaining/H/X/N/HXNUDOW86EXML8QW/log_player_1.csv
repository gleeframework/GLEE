# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer, keeping in mind that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```

Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get back to the original 50/50 split. I'll consider this offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to accept the offer and end the negotiation. We've been going back and forth for a while, and while I was hoping to get a better deal, I don't want to risk going into the last few rounds and potentially getting nothing. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
