"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's early in the game, and I can likely get a better deal.  The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I'll try to leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to give you more than your initial offer, but I also need to get a fair share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as close to the middle as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation is starting to bite, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal.  It's close to the 60/40 split from the first round, and I'm gaining more than the initial offer.  Let's lock this in."
