"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
 I propose a split of $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob.  This seems fair, as I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 I accept Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, $5000 is a decent amount, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
