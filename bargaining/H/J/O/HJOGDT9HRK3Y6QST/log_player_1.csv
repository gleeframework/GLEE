I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  This leaves room for negotiation but gives Bob a decent starting point.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further.  I'll see if I can get him to accept something closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 400,000 and take 600,000 for myself.  This is a more even split, but I'm still taking the lion's share to make up for the inflation that's been eating away at my share."
