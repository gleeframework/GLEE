I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45. I've included a message to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game early, considering the inflation penalty for subsequent rounds. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into our money, let's split and be done!""
}

I've reduced my initial offer to account for the inflation, and I'm trying to convey a sense of urgency to Bob, so we can close the deal before the money loses even more value."

  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is killing us, 50/50 is the fairest deal now!""

I've decided to propose an equal split, considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and hoping he'll agree that an equal split is the best option at this point."
