  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 70/30 split is a more reasonable starting point, considering the value of money will decrease more for you than for me. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
