"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly biased split, but it's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 5% less than the initial $10,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer, as I'd be getting a 40/60 split, which is slightly biased towards Bob. I'm hoping for a more favorable split in the next round! 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 10% less than the initial $10,000.

Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, now it's my turn to try to balance it out!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to balance out the previous round's bias. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still a bit biased, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is catching up quickly! My gain is now worth 14.26% less than the initial $10,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it again. The 45/55 split is still a bit biased towards Bob, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm hoping for a more even split or a slight advantage in the next round!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 21.55% less than the initial $10,000.

Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Back to a 50/50 split, let's try to meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm going back to the original 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will finally accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game!"
