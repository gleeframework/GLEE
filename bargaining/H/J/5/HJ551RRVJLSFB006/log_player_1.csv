"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't beat this offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is still affecting the money's value, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share to account for inflation, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect more! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value, and I need to adjust my expectations accordingly. Considering the significant drop in value, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 48 dollars, even though it's less than I initially hoped for."
