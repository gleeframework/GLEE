"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm still open to negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of the money, and now Bob is offering me a smaller share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 20% share, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking another 20% bite, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping you'll be willing to meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a small token of goodwill. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now. Bob's offer is even more lopsided than before. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the value of the money has decreased so much due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, my share is now worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to squeeze out a bit more. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even smaller share, but hoping that he'll finally accept and we can end this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in yet, but I'll give you a tiny crumb. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting due to inflation! Bob's offer is now laughable, and I'm not even sure if the 50,000 I'd get is worth anything at this point. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept such an insultingly small share. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will finally make a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to ravage the value of the money, my share is now almost worthless. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20000,
  ""bob_gain"": 980000,
  ""message"": ""I'm barely scraping by at this point, but I'll give you a token amount to end this nightmare!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a minuscule share, but hoping that he'll finally take pity on me and accept this paltry offer."
