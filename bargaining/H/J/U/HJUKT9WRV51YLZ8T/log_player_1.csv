"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair and simple way to divide the money, and we can still get a decent amount each. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
