Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the previous round, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a better starting point. Let's see how this works out.  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
