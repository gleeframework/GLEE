"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split seems a bit off considering the inflation.  I'll take a slightly smaller cut to end this quickly. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's analyze Bob's offer. While he claims to take a smaller cut, the inflation actually benefits him in this scenario. He's aiming to secure a win early on while the impact on my gains is higher. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Don't be hasty Bob, inflation is hitting us both. Let's be realistic.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation.  While he claims to ""meet in the middle,"" the offer barely budges from his previous one, and the inflation is increasingly working against me. I need to push for a more significant shift in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
