I'm proposing a 950,000:50,000 split. I figure this is a good starting point, as it gives me a significant portion of the money while still offering Bob a chance to get something.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is generous, it's only fair after inflation.  I'm going to reject it and see if we can negotiate something closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000}
```

After Bob's rejection and the effects of inflation, I'm proposing a 475,000:525,000 split. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which is fair considering we've both lost some of our initial gains due to inflation."
