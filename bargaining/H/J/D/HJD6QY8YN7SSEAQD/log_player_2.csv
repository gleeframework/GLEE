Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here.  The money is losing value, so a 50/50 split seems like the most logical option.  It's fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
