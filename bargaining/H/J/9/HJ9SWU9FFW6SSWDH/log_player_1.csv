This is a bit of a risky move, but I want to try to get as much as possible in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
