"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This offer gives me $700,000 and Bob $300,000, which is a 70-30 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a fair split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Since the offer is a 50-50 split, it's a fair proposal. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, considering the initial offer I made was 70-30.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my potential earnings are now worth 5% less than in the previous round. Considering Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority. Consider this a compromise!""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000, a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I think I deserve more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more, but I also don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value. Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is closer to his original 50-50 proposal. I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I'll have to decide quickly.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
