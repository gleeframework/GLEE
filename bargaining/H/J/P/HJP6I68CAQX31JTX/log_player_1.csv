"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a very unequal split, giving myself the vast majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept this in the first round, as the value of his share will diminish quickly with each passing round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation. It's better to accept and get something than to risk losing everything in the following rounds."
