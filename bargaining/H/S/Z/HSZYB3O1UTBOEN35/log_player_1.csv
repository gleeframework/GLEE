Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself.  I'm assuming Bob will want some money and will accept this offer to avoid getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more than 50%, the inflation is a serious factor.  Accepting a 50/50 split is a safe bet to avoid getting nothing in the later rounds."
