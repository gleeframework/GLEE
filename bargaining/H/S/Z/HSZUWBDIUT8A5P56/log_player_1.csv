"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

I propose to keep $99 and give Bob $1. This is a very fair deal considering I have to take the risk of inflation and Bob gets something for nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it may seem like a good deal now, I have 10 rounds left to potentially get a better offer, especially since Bob's gains are decreasing due to inflation.  I'm willing to take the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm offering Bob $10.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but I'm still taking the lion's share. Inflation is working in my favor, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future if needed."
