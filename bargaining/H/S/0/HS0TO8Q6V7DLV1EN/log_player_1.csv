I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing the money will be worth less for Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm proposing a slightly less favorable split for Bob than in the first round, but still significantly more than his last offer. Since the money is worth less for both of us with each round, I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value."
