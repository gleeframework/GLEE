Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too tilted in your favor. Let's be fair, this is almost a 50/50 split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5445,
""bob_gain"": 4555,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  This is the last round where I can offer you more than you'd get by taking it to round 4. I'm offering you slightly more than you'd gain by waiting. It's a good deal!""

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Calculation:** By round 3, the inflation significantly impacts the value of the money. It's crucial to end the game in this round. 
* **Anticipating Bob's Moves:** If we reject Bob's offer, he'll likely offer us the bare minimum in round 4, knowing we're desperate to avoid further inflation.
* **The Power of Round 3:** This is the last round where I can make an offer that benefits Bob more than simply waiting. This leverage gives my offer weight."
