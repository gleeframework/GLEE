"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I want to secure a large share early on, knowing the money will depreciate. This also allows me to see Bob's reaction and strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is being greedy, offering a 10/90 split in his favor. While I lost a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation, accepting this would be foolish. I still have a chance to negotiate a better deal in the future. I'll reject this offer and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid further inflation.  I'm reducing my share by 100,000 to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to exploit the inflation, and while I've lost significant value, I'm not going to give in so easily. I'll reject this offer, as it's worse than his previous one. There's still time for negotiation, and I'll keep fighting for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, this time by 100,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that Bob will accept, but I'm also aware that the value of the money is declining with each round. If he rejects this offer, I might have to start accepting lower amounts to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too unfavorable, even considering the inflation.  While I'm losing value with each round, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making another concession, but this time I'm going to push back a bit harder. The inflation is really starting to bite, and I'm worried that if I keep giving in, I'll end up with very little.  This offer still gives Bob a significant share, but I need to secure at least 600,000 for myself to avoid a major loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn. He's still trying to push for a 60/40 split, even as the inflation continues. I'm losing a lot of money with each passing round, but I won't give up yet. This offer is still too low, and I'll reject it. I'll need to carefully consider my next move, as the clock is ticking."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is taking a serious toll, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  However, I'm not willing to give up completely.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason. If he rejects this offer, it's likely we'll both end up with nothing, and I'm not willing to let that happen."
