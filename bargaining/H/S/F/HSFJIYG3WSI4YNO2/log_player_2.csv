Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good deal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This accounts for inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I need a better deal 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the threat of inflation to her advantage, but I still have time to negotiate a better deal. Accepting $4,000 now would be significantly less valuable than what I could potentially get in a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is the most fair I can go. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Appearing Firm:** By taking a firm stance with a 50/50 split, I'm showing Alice I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal.  
* **Simplicity:**  A 50/50 split is the easiest to agree on, and avoids further complicated negotiations as time runs out."
