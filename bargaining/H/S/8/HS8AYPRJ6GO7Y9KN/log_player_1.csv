Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a small share early on, or if he's going to play it safe and try to get a larger share later.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to minimize my risk of getting nothing at all."
