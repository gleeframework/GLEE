"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm the one who's bold! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'd be getting $4,000, which is equivalent to $4,545 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about taking less, but Bob's message suggests he's trying to be bold. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.

For now, I'll decide to reject his offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $9,000. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still trying to get a decent share for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
