"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I take Bob's offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 90% of the original $44.50 (40/1.1).

I'll have to decide whether this is a good deal for me. Hmm...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to take 55 dollars and leaving 45 dollars for Bob."
