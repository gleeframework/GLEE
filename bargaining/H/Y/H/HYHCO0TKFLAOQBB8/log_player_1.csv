"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial 100$, which is 30 dollars. I'm keeping the remaining 70 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair start, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's see what Bob's proposal is worth.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The money is worth less now due to inflation, but I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer will be slightly lower than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining 100$ (which is now worth less due to inflation), and keeping 55% for myself. Let's see if Bob will make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Alice's gain: 60% of the remaining 100$ is 60$.
Bob's gain: 40% of the remaining 100$ is 40$.

Considering the effects of inflation, my gain is worth 51.2% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 29.1% less than in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. The offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money."
