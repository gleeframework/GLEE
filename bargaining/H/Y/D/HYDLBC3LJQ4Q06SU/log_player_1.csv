"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a very straightforward offer.  I'm taking 90% and leaving Bob with 10%.  It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping he'll accept since it's the first round and the money hasn't yet begun to devalue for me.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot more reasonable than my first one, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I know the money is losing value with each round, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal. It's still early in the game, and I'm willing to risk it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, but I still want a larger share.  I'll offer 7000 for myself and 3000 for Bob.  This feels like a more balanced offer, and hopefully, he'll see it as a good compromise.  We are already halfway through the game, so we need to reach a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting serious. I'm losing a significant amount of value with each passing round, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.  While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is fair enough.  I'll accept and get something out of this game."
