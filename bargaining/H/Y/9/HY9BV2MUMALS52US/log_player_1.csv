"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 50% of the money, and keeping the other 50% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is 60/40 in his favor, I'm not thrilled about it. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a reduced gain due to inflation.

I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
