"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take 80%. You can either accept or propose a better deal for yourself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in the second round, $10,000 is now equivalent to $9,000. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is 55.56% of the equivalent $9,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
