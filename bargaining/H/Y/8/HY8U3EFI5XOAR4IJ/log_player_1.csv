"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is a relatively fair split, and I'm leaving 20% for Bob. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller effective gain.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
