"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair starting point, let's see if you can do better!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $50 (initially 50% of $100, but 5% less due to inflation)
* Bob's gain: $50 (initially 50% of $100, but 5% less due to inflation)

I'll accept Bob's offer!
