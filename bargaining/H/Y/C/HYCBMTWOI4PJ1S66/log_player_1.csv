"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor.  Since we have 12 rounds, I want to secure the majority of the money early, leaving room for negotiation later if needed.  Let's see if Bob is agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm going to reject it. I know that with every round, inflation makes the money worth less to Bob. This is a good opportunity to try to secure a more favorable split.  I'm going to see if I can push for a bigger portion of the pie in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 70/30, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm still prioritizing a larger share for myself, but I'm acknowledging that Bob's offer was fair.  This should hopefully lead to a faster resolution."
