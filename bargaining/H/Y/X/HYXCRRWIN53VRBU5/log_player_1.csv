{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 40% is a good enough share for me, considering the initial offer was 60%. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer because it's getting close to my initial proposal of 60%. Additionally, considering the effects of inflation, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
