"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer from Bob.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, Bob is proposing a 40-60 split, which is not as favorable to me as my initial 50-50 proposal. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
