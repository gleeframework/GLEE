  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a near even split, acknowledging your initial offer. It's better than risking losing everything with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
