This is a tough spot. While I'd like a better deal, here's why I'm accepting:

* **Severe Inflation:**  With a nearly 20% decrease in value, waiting longer is disastrous for me. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  She's shown no willingness to budge much. Holding out might result in even worse offers.
* **Something is better than nothing:** Getting $380,000 is a significant loss compared to earlier rounds, but it's better than the game dragging on and me getting even less. 

It's a gamble, but at this point, cutting my losses feels like the safest option."
