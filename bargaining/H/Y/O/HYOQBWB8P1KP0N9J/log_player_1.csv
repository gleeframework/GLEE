"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the money!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than before, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.95 = 427,500
* Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.95 = 522,500

I'll accept this offer.
