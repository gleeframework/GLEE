"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a generous offer, but I want to secure a significant portion of the money early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's frustrating that Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm willing to accept his proposal.  The 60/40 split still gives me a decent amount of money, and considering the inflation, accepting is the best strategy to avoid ending up with nothing."
