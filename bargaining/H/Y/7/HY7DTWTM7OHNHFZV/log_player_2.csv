"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to go for a ""fair"" split, but remember, the money is worth less to Alice with each round. I'll see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try 60/40 in my favor this time, and we can both see where we stand in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fair split 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is getting a better deal than I am, but with inflation kicking in, I'd rather get something than nothing."
