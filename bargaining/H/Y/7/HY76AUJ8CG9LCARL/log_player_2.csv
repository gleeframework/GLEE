**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, which is working in my favor. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can push for a slightly better outcome in the next few rounds.  I need to balance getting a better deal with the risk of letting too many rounds pass."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Let's settle this now, Alice. 52-48, my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but making it clear this is my final offer.  The ""final offer"" tactic can be effective in negotiations, as it creates a sense of urgency and limits further back-and-forth. This is balanced against the increasing risk of running out of rounds."
