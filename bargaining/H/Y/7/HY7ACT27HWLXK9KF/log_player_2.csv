"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. My gain of 5000 is worth 0.64 * 5000 = 3200 in the first round, which is more than my initial gain of 3000. Alice's gain of 5000 is worth 0.81 * 5000 = 4050 in the first round, which is more than her initial gain of 7000. This offer is better for me than the initial offer, and it's a 50-50 split, which is fair.
