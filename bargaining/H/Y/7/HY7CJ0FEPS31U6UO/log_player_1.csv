* Bob would gain $6,000, which is worth 95% of the original $6,333.33 he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, Bob's message suggests that he might be willing to give me an even better deal next round, so I'll decide to...
