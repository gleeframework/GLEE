"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 90% of the money, leaving you with 10%. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing to take 90% of the $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $100,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'll have to divide the proposed amount of $300,000 by 0.9 (1 - 0.1 inflation) to get the equivalent value in the first round's money. That's $333,333.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's better than going to the next round and risking a worse deal due to further inflation. So, I'll accept Bob's offer.
