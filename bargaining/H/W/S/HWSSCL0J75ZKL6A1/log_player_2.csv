"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest, especially considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's get this done.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has hurt me more than Alice, accepting this offer is the best option. I'm losing money with each round, and there's no guarantee that Alice will offer anything better in the next round. It's better to secure a portion of the money now than risk getting nothing at all."
