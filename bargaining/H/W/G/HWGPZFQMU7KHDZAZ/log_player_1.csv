"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still be fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 3000 is worth 90% of the original 6000, which is 2700.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's offer, as it seems he's taking a larger share than before. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about your offer, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the previous round's value, which is 2700.

I'll make a new offer, trying to balance the shares:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 45% and you take 55%""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4500 is worth 72.9% of the original 6000, which is 3261.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with an even split, as it seems Bob is getting a slightly larger share due to the different inflation rates. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it evenly, I'll take 5000""
}
```"
