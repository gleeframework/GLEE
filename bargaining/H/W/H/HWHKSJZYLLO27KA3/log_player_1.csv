"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money 55/45. It's a better deal than your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take the same split you offered, but with me getting the slightly larger share. It's only fair.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll increase my share a bit. It's still a relatively fair deal considering the inflation is starting to kick in. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  He's hoping the fear of inflation will push me to accept a bad deal.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even with the inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a better deal than your last, and I'm taking a smaller cut than my last. Let's settle this before the inflation eats away at the value even more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is eating away at the value, I think it's time we settle on a deal that slightly favors me. This is as fair as it gets under the current circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a serious factor. While Bob's offer is back to the initial split he proposed (which I rejected), it's better to accept a less than ideal deal than risk getting nothing at all as the rounds progress."
