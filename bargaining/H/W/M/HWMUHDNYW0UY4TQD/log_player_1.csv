"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this for now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 20% bite, the money is now worth 80% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, but still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any younger either, but I'm not getting desperate yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll reject this offer as well. The inflation is taking a bigger bite, and I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, the money is now worth 40.96% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 416000,
  ""bob_gain"": 584000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit worried, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. Don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the increased inflation, but still trying to maintain a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting to get desperate, I can smell it! I'll give you a chance to reconsider. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to psych me out!

However, I'll look at the numbers. With the inflation, the money is now worth a mere 32.77% of its original value. My gain of 400,000 is actually a decent share considering the circumstances.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair deal given the current state of the economy.
