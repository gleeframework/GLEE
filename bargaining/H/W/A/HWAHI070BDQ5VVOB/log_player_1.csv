"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'll start with a 90/10 split.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him, considering the money will be worth less in the next round!  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is less than my initial proposal, it's still a significant amount of money.  With inflation, it's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
