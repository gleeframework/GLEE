"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive losses from inflation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With a 5% decrease in value for me and a 10% decrease for Alice, I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decrease in value for both of us. Since Alice loses more value each round, I'll try to find a compromise that might appeal to her.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground. This way, we both get a decent share, and we minimize our losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before we both lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the impact of inflation, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable. If we continue, the value will decrease further, and I might end up with less than what I'm being offered now.
