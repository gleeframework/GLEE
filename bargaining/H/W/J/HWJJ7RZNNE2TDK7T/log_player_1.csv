"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more equitable. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid going to the next round.
