"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to counter! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $2,400.

I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer, as I'd rather have more money. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my gain of $4,000 would be worth $3,200.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""You said I was starting high, but I'm willing to compromise. Take the majority, but I'll get a bit more than before.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but don't think I'm getting soft! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $4,500 is actually worth $2,340.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the money is worth significantly less than before. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
