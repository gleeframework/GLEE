"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it might seem tempting to take $40 now, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation works in my favor as well."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""My turn! How about a slight adjustment to be a bit more equitable? This offer is better than what you'll get in the next round with the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Take Advantage of Inflation:** Alice is losing value faster than I am. By round 2, the $45 she's offered me is already worth less to her.
* **Fairness with a Slight Edge:**  This offer is still in the realm of ""fair"" but gives me a slight advantage. 
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm applying a bit of pressure by highlighting that the deal will be worse for her in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't offer enough, let's try this 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my patience, but she's losing value faster than I am.  This offer is barely better than her last one, even with the inflation factored in. I need to push for a more significant change in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice! This offer is more than generous considering the inflation. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  With each round, the stakes get higher due to inflation.  I'm increasing my demand to add pressure and highlight the urgency.
* **Flipping the Script:**  By offering her a 60/40 split (the inverse of her initial offer), I'm emphasizing how much value she's losing by being stubborn. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Even though I'm increasing my demand, I'm framing it as a ""generous"" and ""realistic"" offer in light of the circumstances. This might make Alice more receptive than outright rejecting her offer and proposing something drastically different."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, Bob? I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, knowing the inflation hurts her more than me.  A 45/55 split is not acceptable, especially now that we're past the halfway point. She needs a reality check."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting out of hand.  Accept this offer, or we both walk away with nothing.  Don't let greed cloud your judgment.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong-Arm Tactic:**  It's time for a more aggressive approach. I'm increasing my demand again and making it clear this is non-negotiable.
* **Ultimatum:** By framing it as ""accept this or get nothing,"" I'm putting the final decision squarely on her shoulders.
* **Appealing to Logic vs. Emotion:**  Alice seems to be letting greed dictate her decisions.  I'm reminding her of the very real consequences of her stubbornness. 

At this point, it's a gamble. Alice has shown she's willing to push things, even if it means losing money. However, the threat of getting nothing might be enough to make her reconsider her strategy."
