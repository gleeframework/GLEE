"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's divide fairly"". I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, so we can end the game here.\n\n###\nYour turn! What will Bob do?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I still want to get more than half of the total amount. Also, I know that the money is worth 20% less to Bob in this round, so I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new offer to Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""You're losing value, I'm being generous""}\n\n###\nYour turn! What will Bob do?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""You're losing value, I'm being generous""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $3,500 and keep $6,500 for myself. My message to Bob is ""You're losing value, I'm being generous"". Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each round, I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to accept my offer now rather than waiting for the next round.\n\n###\nYour turn! What will Bob do?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from your last offer.  This gives you a bigger share, but I'm losing value quickly with each round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Since Bob is willing to compromise and give me a bigger share, and considering that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I think this is a good deal. Additionally, Bob is losing value quickly with each round, so I don't think I can negotiate for a much better deal in the next round.\n\n###\nIt looks like the game is over! I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000."
