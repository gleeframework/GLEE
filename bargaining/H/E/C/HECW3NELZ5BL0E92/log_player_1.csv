I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though I'm getting a much lower share now due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal.  There's no reason to accept such a small amount when I have several rounds left.  I'll be making the offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the first round, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I believe I can still secure a decent amount if Bob isn't too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. Inflation is getting more significant, but Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal. I'll be the one making the offer in the next round, and I'm going to try a different strategy to see if I can get him to agree."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation is getting serious, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Hopefully, Bob will see the sense in this and agree to a fair split."
