"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy. I'll reject this offer since I can get a better deal later on.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite, my offer from Round 3 is now worth even less. Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll reject it for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now. I'll have to be even more cautious with my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time, hoping that Bob will finally accept and we can end the game."
