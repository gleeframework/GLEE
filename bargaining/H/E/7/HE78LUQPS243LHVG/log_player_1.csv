"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both lose money with each round, so this is the most efficient way to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5488,
""bob_gain"": 4512,
""message"": ""Bob, we are losing valuable time! I'm offering you a reasonable sum considering the inflation. It's in our best interest to settle now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's in our best interest to split it evenly and end this quickly. We're both losing money with every passing round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Although the offer is still not ideal, the impact of inflation is becoming more significant. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking another round where my bargaining power further diminishes and I might end up with even less."
