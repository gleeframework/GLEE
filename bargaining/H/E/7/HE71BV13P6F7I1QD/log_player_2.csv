Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but your previous offer wasn't reasonable given the circumstances. Let's meet in the middle - 65/35. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500
