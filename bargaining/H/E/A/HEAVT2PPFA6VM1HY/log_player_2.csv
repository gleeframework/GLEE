I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm aware of the inflation, so I need to be strategic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt, and a 50/50 split is a decent outcome considering the circumstances.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all."
