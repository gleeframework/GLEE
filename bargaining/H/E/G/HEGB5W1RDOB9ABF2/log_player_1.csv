Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, but I want to get a good deal on the first round and set a precedent for future rounds.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if Bob accepts, as the inflation penalty is small at the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this 50/50 split is the most rational choice.  The inflation penalty is starting to kick in, and further rounds risk losing even more money. This offer guarantees a significant amount, and the potential for further rounds isn't worth the risk of losing more."
