"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep 9000$ for myself and give 1000$ to Bob.  This ensures I get the majority of the money and hopefully Bob will accept as it's better than nothing.  I will keep an eye on the inflation effect as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gains significantly. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me 4000$, which is still a considerable amount, and the risk of further inflation and potential lower offers makes this the best option."
