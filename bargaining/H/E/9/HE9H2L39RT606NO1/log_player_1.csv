"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $8,000 is now worth 5% less than the initial $9,000, so it's equivalent to $8,500 in the first round's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low, I'll hold out for a better deal!""
}
