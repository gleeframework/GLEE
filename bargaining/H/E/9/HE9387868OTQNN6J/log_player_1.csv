Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, as I want to get this over with quickly before the inflation hits!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unfair! I'm willing to take a bit less, but 1000 is way too low, especially with the inflation! I'll counter with a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a good split, but I'm willing to give Bob a bit more this time, hoping to avoid further rounds and the escalating inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor.  The inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm not giving in to such an unfair deal. I need to push for a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split again. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need to make sure I get something reasonable.  The inflation is getting out of hand, and we need to come to an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round! I'm not going to accept anything this unfair, especially with the inflation. I need to push for a better deal before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. It's time for Bob to meet me in the middle."
