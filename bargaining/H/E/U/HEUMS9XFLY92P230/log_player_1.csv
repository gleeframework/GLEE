"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, let's start with this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my $4,000 gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's $6,000 gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the first round, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
