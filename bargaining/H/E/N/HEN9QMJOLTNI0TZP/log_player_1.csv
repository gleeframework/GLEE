"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the value of the money will decrease over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I want most of it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants most of the money, huh? That's not very generous of him!

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is actually equivalent to taking 80% of the original $1,000,000, which is a pretty steep ask.

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! A fair split is the way to go!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller chunk, but I'm not budging on my demand! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is even less generous than before, and the money is worth significantly less for him due to inflation.

Considering the value of the money is decreasing, I'll try to take advantage of this and aim for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you a huge chunk, but I'll give you something to make it worth your while... maybe. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing value fast for Bob! His offer is still quite lopsided, but I'll consider it since the money is worth less for him.

However, I'm not thrilled about taking only $100,000, which is a relatively small share of the original amount. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob, but I'm willing to give you a bigger share to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a larger share, but I'm not giving up yet. Let's see if Bob is willing to take the deal!"
