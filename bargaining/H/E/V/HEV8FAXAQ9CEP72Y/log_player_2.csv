"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we take $70 and you take $30.  This is a generous offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not too worried about the inflation yet, we have 12 rounds. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point. It takes into account the upcoming inflation, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts you more than me.  I'm offering $65 for me and $35 for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer. While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm not sure I can get a better deal considering the inflation. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers."
