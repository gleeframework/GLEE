"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will see the wisdom in accepting my offer and we can avoid the hassle of going through 11 more rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering you a good deal. Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less after inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the money roughly evenly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split this time, with me getting 55% of the money and Bob getting 45%."
