"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 50/50 split seems reasonable, but I'd rather get a bit more to account for the initial inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting now!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 40:60 split is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal later.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. I'm not getting my preferred deal, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal."
