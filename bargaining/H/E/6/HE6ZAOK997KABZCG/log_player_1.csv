Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather take a bigger share now, since my money is losing value fast. This is my best offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  It's clear he's feeling the pressure of the inflation working against him. I believe holding out will lead to a more favorable outcome for me in the next round or two."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  It's better than what you'll get in subsequent rounds, even if you were to make the offer then.""}"
