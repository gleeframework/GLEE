"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 30 is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

With this in mind, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the reduced value of the money Bob gains due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect and the fact that Bob's offer was 30-70, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money Bob gains. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still relatively close to the original 60-40 split I proposed in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 25 is the most I can afford considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! With the money Bob gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a much better deal than I initially expected.

Considering the significant difference in value between our shares, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's a good time to stop negotiating and take the better offer, especially since the inflation is making Bob's share worth less and less with each passing round."
