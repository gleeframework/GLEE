"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can split the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, but still willing to compromise."
