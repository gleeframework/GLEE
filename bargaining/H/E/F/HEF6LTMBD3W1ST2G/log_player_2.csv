Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you.  I'm offering you a deal while there's still a decent amount left for you to take. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, the effects of inflation are really starting to hurt. While not ideal, getting a little something is better than holding out for more and risking getting almost nothing if Alice is also getting impatient.
