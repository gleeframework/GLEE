900000.0,100000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,Your offer was a bit greedy Alice. How about I take 70% and you get 30% before inflation eats away at my share?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need a good share. How about 80/20? It's a better deal for both of us than what we've seen so far.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you 40%, which is more than double my last offer.  Take it before inflation eats away even more of my share!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll take 70% and give you 30%. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation.  Let's end this before we lose even more money.",Alice,5,
