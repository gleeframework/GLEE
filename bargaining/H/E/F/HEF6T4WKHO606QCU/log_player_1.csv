I'm taking a greedy approach and offering Bob the bare minimum.  Let's see if he's willing to accept such a small portion in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer might seem tempting at first, it's important to remember that we have 12 rounds to divide the money. If we both keep rejecting, we'll eventually reach a point where the remaining money is insignificant due to inflation. 

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that is more equitable and takes inflation into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a significantly larger share than my previous offer, but it's still a very favorable deal for me considering I'm taking 90% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept a compromise, especially considering the potential for even less money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Bob's offer is still very lopsided in his favor, and while the inflation is starting to have a noticeable impact on his gains, it's not enough to make me accept such a small portion of the money. I'm hoping he'll realize that continuing to reject offers will lead to a situation where we both get a smaller share in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share again to 80%, hoping to find a middle ground. This offer is still significantly in my favor, but it shows a willingness to compromise and avoids a situation where we both get nothing."
