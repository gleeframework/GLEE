"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer. 

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, and Bob's offer is 50/50 split, I'd be getting 5000 * 0.8 = 4000 in real value, and Bob would be getting 5000 * 0.95 = 4750 in real value.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the reduced value of money.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the money in this offer.

My gain is 4500 * 0.512 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% = 0.512) = 2304
Bob's gain is 5500 * 0.855 (since 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% = 0.8574) = 4692.7

I'd be getting a smaller share, but the money is still worth less due to inflation. I'll accept this offer to end the game.
