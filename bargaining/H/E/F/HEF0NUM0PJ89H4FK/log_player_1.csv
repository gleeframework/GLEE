Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better balance, considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, my previous offer is now less valuable. I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate, but still offering you a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using manipulative tactics, framing his offer as generous due to inflation when it's essentially the same unfavorable split from Round 2.  It's crucial to stand firm at this point. While the value is decreasing, accepting a bad deal just sets a precedent for Bob to continue lowballing me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a good portion, and it's the best you'll get considering the time constraint and inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer represents a middle ground that still leans in Alice's favor. By now, Bob should realize Alice is serious about not accepting unfavorable deals. This offer incentivizes Bob to accept before the value diminishes further, making a less appealing deal for him in the later rounds."
