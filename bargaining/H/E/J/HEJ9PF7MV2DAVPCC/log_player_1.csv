"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a near-perfect split in my favor. This ensures I get the majority of the money, while still leaving Bob with a small token amount. It is highly likely he will accept this offer, as even a small amount is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much better deal for Bob, and it's likely he's playing strategically. I reject this offer and prepare to make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than he offered me, but still a significant amount. This is a fair compromise that balances our interests and provides a good outcome for both of us.  Since inflation has reduced the value of his previous offer, he may be more inclined to accept this one."
