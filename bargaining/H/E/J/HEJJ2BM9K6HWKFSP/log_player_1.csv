Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with a decent amount. However, I'm keeping the majority for myself, knowing the money will be worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject, we go to round 3, and I'm guaranteed to lose even more due to inflation.  A 500,000 gain is still significant, and it's better than risking a smaller payout later."
