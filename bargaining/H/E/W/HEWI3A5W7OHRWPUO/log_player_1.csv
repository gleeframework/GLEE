I'm going to be greedy and try to take almost everything. This is a risky move, but I'm betting that Bob will see it as a better deal than what he might get in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's true that the money I'm getting is worth less due to inflation, it's still a better deal for me to keep playing. I'll be able to offer a better deal to Bob in the next round and hopefully get him to accept it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to try the same strategy as before. Bob rejected my first offer, but now he's facing the same inflation that I am. If he rejects this offer, he'll be risking getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation has hit me hard, I still reject this offer. I'm confident that Bob will be more willing to negotiate in the next round, as he'll be facing the same inflation as me. I'll make him a slightly better offer and try to reach a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of offering almost everything to Bob. He's likely to see that rejecting my offer will mean a worse deal for him due to inflation. Hopefully, he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Even though the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money I'm getting, it's better than nothing. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize that continuing this game will result in a worse outcome for him as well."
