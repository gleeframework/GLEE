I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor makes this a good deal for me. It's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
