"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high offer for myself, leaving Bob with a small amount.  I'm hoping he'll be tempted to take it since it's a better deal than he'll get if he rejects and we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more money, I'm happy to accept this offer. If I reject, the money I gain will be worth even less in the next round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob."
