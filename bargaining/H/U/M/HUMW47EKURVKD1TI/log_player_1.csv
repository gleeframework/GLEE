"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can split this more evenly, considering the inflation factor. You'll still get more than me, but less of a difference than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see how this plays out in further rounds. I'm not going to accept an offer where I lose more to inflation than I gain in the deal!"
