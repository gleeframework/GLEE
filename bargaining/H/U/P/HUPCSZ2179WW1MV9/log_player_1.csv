"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will either accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be more flexible than you, but I still believe this split is fair. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'm actually getting less than 45 in real terms. Considering that, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous to him.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try this split.""
}
```"
