"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $40 and kept $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that it's a fair deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slight hit, but it has to be fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressured by inflation. However, considering Bob's offer gives me $45, which is less than the $60 I initially proposed but more than the $40 I offered Bob, it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to ensure I get a decent share without risking further negotiations that might not go in my favor.
