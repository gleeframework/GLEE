This is a tough spot. While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking an even worse outcome in the next round.  Here's why accepting is the least bad option:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 22.62% inflation is already eating significantly into the potential gains. Waiting another round means losing even more.
* **Bob's Stance:**  His ""final offer"" message suggests he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between getting $4,000 now and potentially a slightly lower amount in the next round is not worth the risk of Bob offering even less. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts losses and ends the negotiation."
