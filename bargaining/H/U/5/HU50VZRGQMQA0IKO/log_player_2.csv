Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about a 65/35 split in my favor? This is still a significant concession considering the shrinking value of the money.

# Alice gain: 650000
