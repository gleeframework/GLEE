Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  Let's be practical. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's cutting close, but Bob is still pushing for a larger share while exploiting the inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better offer in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer - it's more than fair at this point, and we're very close to losing it all. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is getting desperate, but I need to hold strong for one more round. This offer is barely better than losing everything."

""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop this. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. Don't let greed make us both losers.""
}
``` 

This is it. The pressure is on, and I need to make Bob see that an even split is the only sensible option left.  He's fixated on getting a bigger share, but he's forgetting that we both lose everything if this goes on.  This offer is our last chance for a win-win."
