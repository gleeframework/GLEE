"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer. As Bob, I'd like to suggest a division of 4000 for myself and 6000 for Alice. I believe this is a more equitable split, considering the value of the money decreases by 20% for me with each passing round. I'd like to describe my proposal as ""A Fairer Split"".\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""A Fairer Split""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Alice's offer. Considering the 36% decrease in value for me due to inflation, getting 3500 now is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. It seems like Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and her message implies this is her final offer. I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal or the game ending with a worse outcome for me. Please let Alice know I accept her offer."
