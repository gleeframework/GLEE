Let's see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not going to accept 250k when I know there's 1 million on the table!"

I'm taking a bit more for myself this round, but I'm still offering Alice a decent share. Hopefully, she'll see that it's in her best interest to accept."

I'm still not happy with this deal. Even with the inflation, I can do better.  I'm going to try and negotiate a more equitable split."

I'm going to try a slightly higher offer this round.  It's still a good deal for Alice, and I'm hoping she'll realize that we're getting closer to a fair compromise."

I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially with the inflation biting into my potential gains. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split this round.  Inflation is starting to hit hard, and I need to secure a decent share before it gets any worse.  I believe a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something substantial."
