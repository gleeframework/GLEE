"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the effective amount is $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8). I'll make a proposal to divide this amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount is $8,000 * 0.64 = $5,120 for me, and $10,000 * 0.9091 = $9,091 for Alice.

I'll accept Alice's offer from round 3.
