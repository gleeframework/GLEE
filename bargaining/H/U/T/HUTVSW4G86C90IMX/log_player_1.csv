"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, while still offering Bob a small but potentially enticing amount. This is a strategy to test his reaction and see if he's willing to accept a small portion now, or risk getting nothing later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, this offer is much better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds due to inflation.  500,000 is still a significant amount, and it's guaranteed."
