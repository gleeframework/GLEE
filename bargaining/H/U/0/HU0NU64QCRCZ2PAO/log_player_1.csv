"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. I believe this is fair given the uncertainty of future rounds and the risk of inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While inflation will eat into the value of the money, I believe this is a fair compromise that will allow us both to walk away with a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
