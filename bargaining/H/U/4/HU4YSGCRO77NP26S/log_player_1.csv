"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, shall we?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's start with a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of a 50-50 split, I think Bob is trying to be reasonable. However, considering the inflation, the actual amounts we'd be getting would be:

* My gain: $50 * 0.8 = $40
* Bob's gain: $50 * 0.8 = $40

It's a fair split, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

* My gain: $45 * 0.516 (48.8% of the original value) ≈ $23.27
