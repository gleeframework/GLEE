  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a more equitable division, considering the risks involved in continuing this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
