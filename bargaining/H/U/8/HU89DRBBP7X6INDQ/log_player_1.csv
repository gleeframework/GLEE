"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 300k, let's split it now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. My message is a straightforward one - I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can split the money now!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the value of money will decrease in the next round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of 450,000$ is actually worth 0.95 * 450,000 = 427,500$.

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, especially considering that I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value of money. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less in the third round, my gain will be worth 0.95^2 * 427,500 = 399,087.50$.

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 600k, but I think I deserve more considering the value of money is decreasing rapidly.""
}
```"
