"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to take 90% of the money and leave 10% for Bob. I want to start with a generous offer in hopes that Bob will accept, and we can avoid the risks of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  If I reject, I'll be making the offer in the next round, but the money will be worth even less due to inflation.  This offer still gives me a decent share, and avoids further risk."
