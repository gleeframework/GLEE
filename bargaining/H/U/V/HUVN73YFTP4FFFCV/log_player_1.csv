"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000 and keep $8000 for myself.""
}
```

This is a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair.  Let's each take half, with me getting a slight edge to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. The offer from Bob is a 45-55 split, which is still not as favorable to me as I would like.

However, considering the inflation, I think this is a relatively fair offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting a worse deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
