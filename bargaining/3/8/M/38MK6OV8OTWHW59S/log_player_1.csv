"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.95 = 5700

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

I'm offering you $4,500, and I'll take $5,500."
