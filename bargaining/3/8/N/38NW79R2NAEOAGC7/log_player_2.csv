"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. This is my last offer! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999900, ""alice_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""I'm being generous this time. Accept this, or we both get less in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's end this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While this offer isn't great, it's significantly better than the 1% I'd get if we continue to the next round due to inflation.  It's time to take what I can get."
