Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives me a large share, but leaves Bob with something.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as I am taking the risk of being the first proposer.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. I am still confident that I can get a better deal.  I will reject and see what he proposes in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to 800,000. Bob's offer was too low, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and potential loss due to inflation."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even with the increased inflation affecting his side, his proposal is worse than my last one. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share again to 700,000.  I'm still hopeful that I can secure a good deal, but with each round, the inflation is making things more difficult. I need to find a balance between securing a decent share and avoiding a stalemate."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even considering the severe inflation on his side.  While it's getting closer to a fair split, I believe I can still secure a better deal.  I will reject his offer and continue the negotiation."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share to 650,000. We're nearing the end of the rounds, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  I need to be realistic but still aim for a decent share. This offer is a compromise, hoping to convince Bob to accept before we both lose out significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far from acceptable, even though inflation is significantly impacting his potential earnings.  I will continue to negotiate, as I believe I can still secure a better deal. This is getting risky, but I'm not ready to accept such a lopsided agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 600,000, recognizing the pressure of inflation. However, I still believe a 60/40 split is reasonable, considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains. This is my final attempt at a fair negotiation before we both risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is the most reasonable given the significant inflation impacting him. We are now in the final rounds, and further negotiation risks losing everything. Accepting this offer ensures that we both gain something."
