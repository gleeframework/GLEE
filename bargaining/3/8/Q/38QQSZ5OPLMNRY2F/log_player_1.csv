"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm starting with a proposal that's heavily in my favor. Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to maximize my gains in the early stages. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for him, especially considering inflation is affecting my gains. I'll try to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still prioritizing my own gain. Since inflation is working against me, I need to be assertive and try to secure a larger portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. Inflation is really hurting my gains, and the money I would receive in the next round would be even less. While I'd prefer to keep negotiating, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances. I'll accept Bob's offer."
