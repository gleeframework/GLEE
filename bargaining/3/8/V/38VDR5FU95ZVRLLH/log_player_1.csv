"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's finish the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bit more, I'm the one who will have to deal with the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'm not willing to give him the majority of the money. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my potential gain, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not going to let you have it all! Take 40%!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to squeeze more out of me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. You're not getting it all, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of him. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 55% of the remaining value of the money just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! With my gain worth only 85.74% of its original value, I need to be more aggressive. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any more than 45% of the remaining value! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up! Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll take 50% and we can call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get back to the original 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. With inflation taking a significant toll on the value of the money, I'm not sure if 50% is enough for me. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll consider this offer. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50% offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
