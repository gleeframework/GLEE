Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be sensible here.  We're both losing money with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to divide the remaining funds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for me every round. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount, whereas holding out for a better deal in later rounds carries significant risk.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems to be fixated on at least a 50/50 split. Holding out might result in him offering even less favorable terms in future rounds. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only a limited number of rounds, reaching a stalemate benefits neither of us. Accepting now guarantees a payout."
