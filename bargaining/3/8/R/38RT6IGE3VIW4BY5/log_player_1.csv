"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is 5000 for both of us, it's a 50-50 split. Considering the inflation, the money is worth less than in the first round, but this offer is still a decent one. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
