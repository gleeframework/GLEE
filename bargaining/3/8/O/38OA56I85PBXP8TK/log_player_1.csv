"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'm effectively getting $5700 (6000 * 0.95).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for more, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much either.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping some advantage for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'm effectively getting $4300 (6000 * 0.8574).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a bit more reasonable than the previous one. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit tired of this negotiation, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit closer to a fair split, but I'm not giving up too much. It's time to see if Bob will accept this offer!"
