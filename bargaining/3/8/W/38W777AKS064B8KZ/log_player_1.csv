"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a relatively fair split. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is to convey a sense of cooperation and reasonableness, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because I feel that a 40-60 split is too skewed in his favor, especially considering that I started with a more even 55-45 proposal. With the inflation devaluing my potential gain by 20%, I'm motivated to try and get a better deal or wait for a potentially more favorable offer in subsequent rounds. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable division.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my proposal to a 52-48 split in my favor, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. The message ""Meet me in the middle?"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise, encouraging him to accept this revised proposal and end the game before the inflation further devalues our potential gains. Your turn!"
