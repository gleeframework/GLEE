"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I'd rather negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll take this opportunity to accept the offer.
