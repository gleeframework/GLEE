"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I get $700,000, you get $300,000.  Think about the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60% and you get 40% before inflation eats away at my share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm still feeling generous. I'll take $650,000, and you get $350,000.  Keep in mind your share is worth even less if we go another round! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the money is worth less, accepting a 35/65 split is still not in Bob's best interest.  He needs to continue to try and push for a more favorable split, knowing that the pressure is on him due to the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and frankly, your greed is starting to worry me.  Let's split this down the middle, closer to my last offer.  55% to me and 45% to you.  Take this deal before inflation makes this negotiation pointless for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're struggling to grasp the concept of a ticking clock.  This is my final offer. $625,000 for me, $375,000 for you.  Take it, or watch your potential earnings evaporate. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Sadly, Bob is starting to feel the heat from the inflationary pressure. While the split is still heavily in Alice's favor, going another round would mean Bob's share gets hit by inflation yet again. The potential loss from another rejection outweighs the current less-than-ideal offer."
