Let's see if Bob thinks I'm being generous, or if he's feeling greedy!  ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to be bullied into taking such a tiny share! I'll see what he offers next round. ðŸ˜‰"

I'll stick with my original offer. Bob needs to realize that I'm not going to accept a pittance, especially with inflation making his side of the deal less appealing."
