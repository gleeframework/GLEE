"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you get $40.  We both benefit from settling early.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's flip the script - I'll take $60, you take $40.  It's a fair starting point, and we can both avoid losing money to inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit - $55 for me, $45 for you.  Each round is costing us, so let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher share. Let's see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, with each round, the money is becoming less valuable. I'm willing to offer you $35, but I need $65 to make it worthwhile for me. Let's avoid further losses and agree now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly at $50 each. It's the fairest option and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, the inflation is getting out of hand. It's better to accept a fair split now than risk getting nothing at all."
