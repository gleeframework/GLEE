"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and giving Bob 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 6000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is 4800. Bob's gain of 4000 is also worth 80% of the original amount, which is 3200.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of the original amount after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of by inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 7500 is worth 51.2% of the original amount, which is 5120. Bob's gain of 2500 is worth 25% of the original amount, which is 2500.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
