"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, Bob. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to find a compromise that benefits both of us, considering the decreasing value of the money.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept less than 5500. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it matches my previous proposal, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us. It seems like a reasonable compromise."
