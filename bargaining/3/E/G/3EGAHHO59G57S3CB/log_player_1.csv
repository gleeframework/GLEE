Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a split of $990,000 for me and $10,000 for Bob.  I'm being generous in the first round, knowing that the value of the money will decrease for me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The money is worth less for me each round, and if I reject, I risk Bob taking an even larger share in the next round."
