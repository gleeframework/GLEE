"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll think it's a fair starting point and try to negotiate for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous. I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly. My gain of 450,000 in the second round is equivalent to 0.95 x 900,000 = 855,000 in the first round, which is less than what I initially offered.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 5% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

I'll aim for a higher gain this time, but not too high, since I don't know how Bob will react. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less in the fourth round, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly. My gain of 400,000 in the fourth round is equivalent to 0.8586 x 900,000 = 774,84 in the first round, which is even less than what I initially offered in round 1.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money is worth 5% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Considering Bob's previous offers, I'll aim for a higher gain this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm getting close to my target. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to his target.

Since the money is worth 22.62% less in the sixth round, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly. My gain of 300,000 in the sixth round is equivalent to 0.7724 x 900,000 = 693,36 in the first round, which is even lower than what I initially offered in round 1.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the seventh round, the money is worth 5% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Considering Bob's previous offers, I'll aim for a higher gain this time. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that Bob might be trying to squeeze me out. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more than 50% of the total. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```"
