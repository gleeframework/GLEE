# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This is a bit more equitable, considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  While my options are dwindling, I need to hold firm for a little longer. Accepting $4,400 now is a significant loss compared to what I could have gotten earlier. There's a chance Alice will panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair option now.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Alice seems persistent in her strategy. Offering a 50/50 split is now the most logical choice. It guarantees me something, which is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'fair' 50/50 is actually unfair considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While Alice's offer is far from ideal, rejecting it carries significant risk. The inflation means each round my potential gains shrink drastically. If I reject this and don't secure a better deal in the next few rounds, I risk ending up with nothing. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to secure something than risk everything on a potentially unrealistic hope for a better offer."
