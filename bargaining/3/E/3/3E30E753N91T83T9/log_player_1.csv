"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair share and can move on to the next round if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and make a counteroffer in the next round.
