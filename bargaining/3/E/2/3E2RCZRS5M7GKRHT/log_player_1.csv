"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate again!

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 60/40 is too extreme. Let's try 55/45 instead.""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a compromise."
