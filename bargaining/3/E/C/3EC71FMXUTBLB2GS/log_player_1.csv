"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Since it's the first round, I'm aiming for a relatively even split, but still slightly in my favor. The message ""Let's split fairly!"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch it up!  I'll take 600,000 this time, and you can have 400,000. We'll both get more money this round, since inflation is working in our favor! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the $400,000 I would get in this round is actually worth less than it was in the first round. Since Bob's gain isn't affected by inflation, he's actually getting a better deal this round, while I'm getting a worse one. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable to Bob while still giving me a decent share. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now (10% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a slightly larger share than I would have in the first round. The message ""Meet me in the middle!"" is an attempt to convey that I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable solution."
