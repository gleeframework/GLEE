I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split, with me getting the larger share.  Let's see how Bob feels about that!  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with a 6000/4000 split. I'm going to hold out for a better deal!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to try and split the difference with Bob.  Let's see if this is more appealing to him!"
