"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to start with a fairer split. This is more even, what do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40/60 split, as I feel it's still a bit too skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
