"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this over with quickly. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm being generous with this first offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm not happy with just $1,000.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering a much better deal than you gave me. Take it or risk getting nothing at all.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take $100,000 than risk getting nothing.  Let's end this before the inflation eats away at what we can both get."
