I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money right away, but I'll leave Bob with a small amount. If he rejects, we have a lot of rounds left to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money,  it's a fair deal.  The inflation will hurt Bob more in the next round, and it's likely I won't get a better offer."
