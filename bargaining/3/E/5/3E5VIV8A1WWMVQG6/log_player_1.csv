"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the equivalent value of his offer in the first round.

To calculate the equivalent value, I'll divide Bob's offer by 0.8 (1 - 0.2 = 0.8, which represents the 20% decrease in value).

Equivalent value for Bob's offer: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000

Now, I'll compare this to my initial offer of 8000. Since 5000 is less than 8000, I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 4000, and the money is worth 20% less for him, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round, considering the cumulative inflation.

Initial inflation rate: 20%
Second-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 40%)
Third-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 60%)
Fourth-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 80%)
Fifth-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 96%)
Sixth-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 96.8%)
Seventh-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 97.68%)
Eighth-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 98.56%)
Ninth-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 99.35%)
Tenth-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 99.74%)
Eleventh-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 99.87%)
Twelfth-round inflation rate: 20% (total: 99.94%)

To calculate the equivalent value, I'll divide Bob's offer by the total inflation factor (99.94):

Equivalent value for Bob's offer: 5000 / 0.9994 â‰ˆ 5001.01

Since Bob's offer is very close to equal, I'll accept it.
