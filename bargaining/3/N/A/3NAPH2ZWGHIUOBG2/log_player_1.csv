"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to this fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but still a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000$ is worth 95% of the original amount, which is 3800$.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
