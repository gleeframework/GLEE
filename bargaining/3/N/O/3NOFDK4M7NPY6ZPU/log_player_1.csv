"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a very generous offer, Bob. I'd like a more balanced split. Your turn!""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced this time, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer from Bob, but still a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, but don't get too excited, it's still a small share for you. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting aggressive!

I'll reject his offer from round 4. That's an extremely lopsided split, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, Bob! I'm not getting taken advantage of. Your turn!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a fair split, Bob. Don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a significant compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, and I'm taking advantage of it! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting ruthless!

I'll reject his offer from round 6. A 5-95 split is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me like that.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Desperate? You're the one who's being ridiculous, Bob! Your turn!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Getting down to the wire, Bob. Time to make a serious offer. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering an 80-20 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a significant compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to nothing, and I'm not going to let you get away with it! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting really aggressive now!

I'll reject his offer from round 8. A 1-999 split is laughable. I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me like that.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're the one who's going to get nothing if we don't make a deal, Bob! Your turn!""

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering a 90-10 split, which is as close to a 50-50 split as I can get at this point. It's time for Bob to decide if he wants to accept a decent offer or risk walking away with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 1000000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. Don't be a cheapskate!""
}
```

I'm offering a 95-5 split, which is as close to taking the whole pot as I can get without being ridiculous. Let's see if Bob will finally accept a decent offer."

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's all mine, you should have taken my previous offer when you had the chance!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too late, Bob! It's a draw!""
}
```"
