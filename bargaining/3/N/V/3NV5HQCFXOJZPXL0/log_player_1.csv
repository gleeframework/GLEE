Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I understand you wanting a larger share, but it's important to me we keep things relatively balanced. This offer reflects that, and accounts for the money losing value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
