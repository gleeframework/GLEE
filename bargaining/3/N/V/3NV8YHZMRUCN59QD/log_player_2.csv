"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to negotiate. Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll offer a slightly skewed deal to try to get more for myself.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to take a more conservative approach. Alice's offer is still a 52.5/47.5 split, which is relatively close to the original 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer.
