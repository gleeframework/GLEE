"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 99 dollars for myself and give Bob 1 dollar. This is a highly advantageous offer for me, as I'll be getting the vast majority of the money. However, since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, he might be persuaded to take this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob is taking a larger share, I'm still getting a significant amount of money (60 dollars).  Considering the inflation affecting Bob's share, it's likely that this is the best deal I'll get."
