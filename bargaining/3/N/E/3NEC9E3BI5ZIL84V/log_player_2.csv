"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take 90%, you take 10%. We can negotiate from there. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's a bit too one-sided for the first round. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. It's fair, and we can move on from here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 65/35. This is the best deal I can offer, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. The inflation is hurting my gains significantly, and Alice's offer is a decent compromise."
