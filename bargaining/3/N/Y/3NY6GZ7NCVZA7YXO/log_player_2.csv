"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer still gives you a significant share, and it accounts for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation impacting my share.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a more equitable deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. It acknowledges the time pressure but is still weighted in my favor given the faster inflation you face. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that time pressure is mounting, but her offer still heavily favors her. It's clear she's trying to leverage the faster inflation against me.  I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer split, even this late in the game."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is pushing it to the limit.  A near-even split is the only fair option with so few rounds left. Don't let greed make us both losers.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's a reasonable split considering the time pressure and the inflation rates.  Let's be sensible and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough one, but I have to be realistic.  

* **Time pressure:**  Only 5 rounds left, and if we reach the end with no agreement, we both get nothing.
* **Inflation:**  My share is eroding much faster than Alice's. Holding out for a better deal in the next few rounds might end up with me getting even less than this offer if Alice continues to inch down slowly.
* **Alice's tone:** Calling it her ""final offer"" suggests she's unlikely to budge much more.

While not ideal, taking Alice's offer now guarantees a payout, even with the inflated losses. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better than walking away empty-handed."
