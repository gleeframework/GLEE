"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd rather get a larger share. However, Bob's offer is still a 60/40 split, which is quite favorable to him. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure you're serious about ending the game. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping you'll accept.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This round, I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's be practical and finish this. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the 70/30 split, Bob is getting a much larger share, and I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'll have to think carefully...

However, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I might have to accept a worse offer to get something.
