"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60, you take 40. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and it's a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer if we split it closer to 50/50.  Let's try 55/45, your gain is still better than the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather not take a smaller share than before. My gain is worth 10% less, but I'd still be getting 45, which is less than the 60 I was initially offered. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gains more significantly, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bigger slice to account for inflation. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is making things tricky, but I'm willing to go back to a 60/40 split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's more fair than the last few offers. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, the 60/40 split is actually more appealing now, as my gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'll accept this offer to get a decent amount, even if it's not as good as my initial offer.
