"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small amount to start, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal later.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair starting point, and we can both benefit from it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. I'll accept his offer to split it evenly:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
