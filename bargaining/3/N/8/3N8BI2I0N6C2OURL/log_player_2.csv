"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself, especially since the money is worth less to Alice with each round.  Let's see if I can get more than 50!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than an even split. I'm willing to give you 40, but I need to get 60 to make it worth my while. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up a bit, but 45 for me and 55 for you seems like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it!  While I'd love to get more, it's better to accept and get 55 than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
