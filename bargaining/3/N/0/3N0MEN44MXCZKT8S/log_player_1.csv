"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share for making the first offer, but that was too low.  This is a fair 55/45 split considering the money will be worth less next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
