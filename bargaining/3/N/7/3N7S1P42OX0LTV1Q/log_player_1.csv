I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a very aggressive opening move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being generous, but I still think I can get more than $500,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. I'll offer Bob $400,000, which is more than his previous offer, but still gives me a significant portion of the money."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, to $700,000. This should make it more appealing to Bob, as he's shown a desire for more than $400,000.  Hopefully, this is enough to get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $450,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the escalating tensions.  Let's see if he finally accepts."

Round 11

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

We're down to the wire!  I'm increasing my offer again,  to $650,000. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he's not going to get much more than this, and accept this offer.  We're both getting close to the point where we'll get nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is ridiculous!  Bob is being incredibly greedy. I'm not going to settle for such a small amount. I'm  rejecting his offer and we'll both end up with nothing.  

This was a fun game, but it shows how even in a situation where both parties can benefit, stubbornness and a desire for an unfair advantage can lead to a worse outcome for everyone involved."
