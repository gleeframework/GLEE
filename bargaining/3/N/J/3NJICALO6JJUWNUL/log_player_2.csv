"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob. Even though the money is worth less in each round, it's not worth accepting a deal where he gets $1. It's better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split.  Let's call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure about that last offer. Let's try a more even split this time. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it would be nice to get more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  After another round, Bob will be losing 14.63% of the value of his earnings due to inflation, and Alice is unlikely to offer anything better.  This offer gives Bob a significant gain compared to the last round."
