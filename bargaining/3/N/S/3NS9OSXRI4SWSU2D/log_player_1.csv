This is a tough one, but I'll accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is immense.  Waiting longer significantly risks getting nothing at all.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer isn't ideal, the value of even a 60/40 split in my favor diminishes rapidly with each passing round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems unlikely to budge much further. His messages imply a firm stance, and risking a worse offer in later rounds is too dangerous now."
