"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%, but we can work it out as we go. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer. While 100,000 is a significant amount of money, it's worth exploring if I can get a larger share, especially since the value of the money decreases for me with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""That's a very generous offer Alice, but how about a 60/40 split? It accounts for the time pressure we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I think 80/20 is still a reasonable split.  We're running out of time, so let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly feeling the time pressure, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting 20% now is barely better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  The clock is ticking!""}"
