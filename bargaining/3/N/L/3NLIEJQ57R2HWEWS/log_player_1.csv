I'm going to offer Bob $10.  I figure he'll accept it since it's better than nothing.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still better than nothing.  I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting offers with inflation cutting into my gains."
