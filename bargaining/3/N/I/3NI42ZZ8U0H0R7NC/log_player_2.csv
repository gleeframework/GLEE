Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference again, don't let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still heavily favoring herself, even with the inflation factored in. While it's true that every round is costly, accepting a bad deal just because we're running out of time is worse. We need to push Alice closer to a more equitable split, especially since she's feeling the inflation more intensely."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split.  Let's end this before inflation eats our profits!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a strong stand and offer a truly fair deal. Going for another slight advantage at this stage is too risky. A 50/50 split is equitable and highlights the urgency of the situation for both of us."
