"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to make an offer.  I anticipate Bob might want to negotiate, but I want to establish a strong starting point.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game. Bob's offer is clearly unfair, even with inflation affecting the money. While I would get something, it's a significant loss compared to my initial proposal. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round when I can propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20, but I'm still holding firm on getting a larger share.  It's likely Bob wants to push for a higher split in his favor, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that still favors me but might be more appealing to him than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too unfair, even with inflation affecting his share.  I'll reject this offer and continue to fight for a more equitable split.  I have a few rounds left to secure a decent deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm still holding firm to get more than what Bob is offering.  I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to him as we approach the midway point of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's share is significantly reduced due to inflation, his offer is still very unfavorable.  I'll reject this and continue to try and reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering 60/40. This feels like a fair compromise considering the inflation and how the game has unfolded.  I'm hoping to reach a point where Bob sees this as a better deal than his last offer, given the significant reduction in his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, even with the inflation impacting his share.  I'm not willing to accept such a low amount when I know I can potentially get more in the next round.  The game is getting tight, but I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This seems like the most fair option given the inflation and the fact that we are both losing money as the game continues.  I hope Bob recognizes the urgency of the situation and accepts this offer, as we are both at risk of getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement."
