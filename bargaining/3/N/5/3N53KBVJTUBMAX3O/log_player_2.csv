"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but be warned, the money's value will only go down with each round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 1,000$ is something, the value will decrease with each round. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 60/40, Bob. I think it's a fair compromise, and we can both benefit from getting something sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. It's better to secure 4000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
