"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm offering you a good chunk of the money. Accept this and we can both walk away with a decent amount. Remember, the longer we wait, the less money we'll both get. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is very tempting, but I'm going to reject it. Even though the money is worth 10% less for Bob each round, it's still a significant loss for him. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can get closer to a 50/50 split in the later rounds.  We still have 10 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that is fairer to both of us."
