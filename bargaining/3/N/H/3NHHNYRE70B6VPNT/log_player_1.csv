{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 7-3, a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 7-3 split, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, the money is decreasing in value rapidly.
