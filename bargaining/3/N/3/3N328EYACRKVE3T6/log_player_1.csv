"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, but I'm willing to be generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now $9,500.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 95% of its original value now, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You said you'd meet me halfway, but I think I deserve more. This is my counteroffer""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to take advantage of the fact that I rejected his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll try to balance it out 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is now worth 86.74% of its original value, so it's now $8,674.

Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than his previous offer. I'm not sure if I should accept it, but I'm also not sure if I can do better. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
