"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can have the rest. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth risking a round to see if Alice will offer a better deal, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split this more evenly. I'll take slightly more since I'm the one making the offer this round, but I'm willing to be fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best choice. Inflation is significantly impacting Alice's potential gains, making her more likely to accept this offer than a more even one in future rounds. My gains are also significantly reduced with each round, so accepting now is the most strategic choice."
