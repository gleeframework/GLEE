Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need more than 35.  Let's split it 40/60.  We're both losing value with each round, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

# Alice gain: 40

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $60 for Bob and $40 for herself is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting any longer risks getting an even worse deal, or even nothing at all if the rounds run out.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a better offer (like the previous $65) isn't worth the risk. The difference in value due to inflation is becoming smaller with each round.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently rejected offers below $40. It's highly unlikely she'll suddenly accept a much lower amount, especially with the time pressure on Bob.

It's a tough call, but accepting the $60 minimizes losses and guarantees Bob gets something from this increasingly unfavorable game."
