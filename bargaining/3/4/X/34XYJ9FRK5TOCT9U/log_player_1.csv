"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair start to the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to fight 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $10,000 is now worth less to me, and Bob's offer is more attractive than before.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
