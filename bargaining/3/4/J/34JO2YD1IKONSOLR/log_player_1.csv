Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should divide it more equally, considering the inflation affects you more.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your share, I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger portion. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is offering a compromise, the deal is still heavily skewed in his favor. The inflation is rapidly eroding my share, and accepting $450,000 now is significantly less appealing than potentially securing a larger amount in a future round, even with the inflation factored in. 

I need to hold firm and push for a more equitable split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and the inflation is becoming a serious problem. While I want a larger share, I need to make a strong offer that Bob is likely to accept. Offering him $450,000 is still a significant amount, and the ""final offer"" tactic might push him towards accepting.  It's a risk, but the alternative is potentially walking away with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm increasing my portion to reflect the changing value. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a terrible offer! Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation. Accepting $300,000 at this stage would be a significant loss, even with the inflation factored in. It's a gamble, but I need to show Bob I'm serious and won't be bullied into accepting a bad deal.  I have to believe he'll be more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this goes any further. This is a compromise to get us both something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running critically short. While this offer heavily favors Bob, I need to make a drastic move to avoid getting nothing. Offering $600,000 might be enough to entice him while still securing me a (significantly reduced) share. It's a risky gamble, but I'm running out of options."
