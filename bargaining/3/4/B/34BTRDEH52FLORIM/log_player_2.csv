"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting both of us, Bob. Let's be reasonable and split it closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Calculate the current value of the money for both players after inflation.
Due to inflation, the money Bob gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, and the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. This means that for Bob, the $100 is now worth $90.25, and for Alice, it's now worth $81.

### Step 2: Determine the minimum acceptable offer for Bob.
Considering the decreasing value of money, Bob should aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss due to inflation. Since Alice is losing more to inflation, Bob has more bargaining power.

### Step 3: Decide on a reasonable offer that Alice might accept.
Given that Alice's last offer was a 45-55 split and considering the increasing impact of inflation, Bob could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal, emphasizing the fairness of compensating for the greater loss Alice incurs due to inflation.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer and message.
Bob could offer a split that slightly favors him more than the previous offer, considering the inflation impact. A possible offer could be a 58-42 split in Bob's favor, emphasizing the need for a fair adjustment due to the differing inflation impacts.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I believe this split is fair as you're losing more value each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Calculate the current value of the money for both players after inflation.
Due to inflation, the money Bob gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, and the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. This means that for Bob, the $100 is now worth $81.45, and for Alice, it's now worth $65.61.

### Step 2: Evaluate the offer based on the current value of money.
Alice's offer of a 50-50 split means Bob would get $50, which, after inflation, is worth $40.72 to him. Considering the significant loss of value for both, the offer seems more reasonable than previous ones, especially since the difference in inflation impact between the two players is increasing.

### Step 3: Consider the potential outcomes of rejecting the offer.
Rejecting the offer would lead to another round, where the money's value would decrease further. The question is whether Bob can negotiate a significantly better deal that would compensate for the additional loss of value due to inflation.

### Step 4: Make a decision based on the potential gains and losses.
Given the substantial loss of value due to inflation and the risk of further devaluation, accepting the offer might be the most prudent decision. It ensures Bob gets a known quantity rather than risking further loss in pursuit of a marginally better deal.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
