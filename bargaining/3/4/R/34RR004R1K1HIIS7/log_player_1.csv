"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get a decent amount of money, but still leave room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth less, so I'm more motivated to accept a fair split. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
