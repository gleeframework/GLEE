"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. Even though it's a fair split, I can try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more equitable, considering the potential for inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, 50-50 split this time. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to push for a better deal, a 50-50 split is a fair compromise and I don't want to risk getting nothing if Alice decides to reject my offer in the next round."
