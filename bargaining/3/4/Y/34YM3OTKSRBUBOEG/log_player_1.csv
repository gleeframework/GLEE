"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, it's fair and simple 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think for a moment... Since the money is worth 10% less now, $5000 is equivalent to $4545 in the first round. I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher share.

```

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at my potential gains!

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less now, $5200 is equivalent to $3734 in the first round. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll think carefully before making a decision...
