"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me a larger share. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with a 6000/4000 split, especially after the first round's rejection. Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the value has decreased significantly due to inflation, I'll accept this offer. It's better to get something than risk getting nothing in future rounds with even lower value."
