"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very greedy offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly. However, I'm aware of the inflation, so I'm not being too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, Bob's offer is quite fair considering the inflation.  It's better than the risk of getting less in the next round."
