"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, since you're getting a worse deal with each passing round. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not willing to accept such a one-sided deal. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I still think 55 is a fair amount considering the inflation. Your turn!""}

I'm willing to compromise and take a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount."
