"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair and simple start, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiation 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious with my decision. Bob's offer is a bit aggressive, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value of money.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
