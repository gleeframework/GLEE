"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I think we can both be happy with this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should split it more evenly, considering the inflation, 55-45 is more than fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go, especially with inflation.  We've both been stubborn so far, let's just end this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### Why accept this offer?\nGiven the inflation and the fact that the value of the money decreases by 20% with each passing round, accepting the 50/50 split at this point seems like the most reasonable decision. Further rounds would only diminish the value of the money, making the share even less valuable for both players. Accepting now ensures that both Bob and Alice get an equal share before the value decreases any further."
