"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced a 60/40 split is fair. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share.""
}
```"
