"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob. This is a generous offer to start the game and build trust, considering the looming inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  Inflation will erode my gains in future rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better.  It's a fair split, and securing $5,000 is better than risking getting nothing."
