"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation affecting me more each round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

This way, I'll try to get a bigger share of the remaining $100, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now.

Considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It seems like a 50-50 split is the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation."
