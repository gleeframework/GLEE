Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first proposer and want to maximize my gain. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is hitting me hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer ensures I at least get some money."
