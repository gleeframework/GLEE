"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn the first round, I, Alice, propose to take 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and offer Bob 40%, which is $400,000. The message to Bob is ""Let's divide fairly."" Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this proposal or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI, Alice, reject Bob's offer in the second round. Although Bob suggests a more balanced split, the division of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for Bob does not seem fair from my perspective, especially considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. It's now my turn to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle after your last offer.""}\n\nIn the third round, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000 and offer Bob $450,000. This offer takes into account the impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us and is a compromise after considering Bob's previous offer. The message to Bob is ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle after your last offer."" Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this proposal or proceed to the next round."
