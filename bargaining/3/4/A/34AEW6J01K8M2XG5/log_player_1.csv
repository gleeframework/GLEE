"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 4:1, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less, so my potential gain of 4000 is actually worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600 in the previous round's value.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, and I think I can do better. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50/50 split. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, aiming for a 50/50 split to maximize my gain."
