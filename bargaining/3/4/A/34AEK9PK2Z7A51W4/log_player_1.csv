"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll be motivated to negotiate and we can reach a better deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's aim for a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're right, a more balanced split is fair, but I'm not giving up yet! I want to try to get a better deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I want to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss in value."

}
```

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're pushing it, Bob! I'm not willing to give up that much. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I don't think a 45-55 split is fair, especially considering the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less for me than for Bob."
