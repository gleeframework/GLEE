"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to split it 50/50!

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: $5,000
Bob's gain: $4,500

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the difference in value. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to my previous offer. Still a good deal for both of us!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you less, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: $4,000
Bob's gain: $4,380 (not $6,000, since it's worth 27.1% less)

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives Bob a higher share, but I'll consider it. I'll accept the offer.
