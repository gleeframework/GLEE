"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the game has just started. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous again""
}

I'm still willing to give Bob a good share, but I'm slightly decreasing my offer since he didn't accept my initial proposal and his counteroffer was quite biased in his favor."
