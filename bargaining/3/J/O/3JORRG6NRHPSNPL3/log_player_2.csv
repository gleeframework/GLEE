I'm offering Alice $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This seems like a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."

Alice's offer is still not good enough.  While the inflation is taking its toll, I still need a better deal than this. I'm going to keep rejecting until I get something more reasonable."

The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still going to try to get a fair deal. I'm offering Alice 400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, given the current circumstances."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not good enough. Inflation is starting to feel really painful now, but I still have to hold out for a better deal.  I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with only $200,000, especially when I know Alice has more to offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

Inflation is really hurting now, and I'm starting to panic a little.  But I'm going to take a risk and propose a 50/50 split. It's a long shot, but if Alice wants any money at all, she'll have to accept it."
