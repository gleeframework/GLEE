"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take 700,000$ and Bob takes 300,000$. I'm trying to take a slightly larger share to account for the inflation that will occur in future rounds, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more balanced split, taking into account the potential inflation. Let's see if we can agree on a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a bit more balanced than my initial offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the second round, so I'll have to be even more cautious.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my gain to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving Bob with enough to make it worth his while to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try an even split. The inflation is affecting us both, and it's important to find a compromise that works for everyone. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now. With my potential gain worth only 85.74% of what it was in the first round, I need to be very careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think an even split is a reasonable compromise, especially since we're getting close to the deadline. I'll accept this offer.
