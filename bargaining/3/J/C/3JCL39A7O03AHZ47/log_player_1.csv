I'm going to propose a very generous offer to Bob, giving him $100,000.  This leaves me with $900,000, which seems like a good starting point.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though the money I'm receiving is worth less due to inflation, I still believe I can do better.  I'm going to make my own offer in the next round and see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to propose a slightly more even split this time.  I'll take $550,000, and give Bob $450,000.  This offer takes into account the inflation we've experienced, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is getting out of hand, and my potential gains are shrinking rapidly.  Accepting this offer means a 45% gain from the initial 1 million dollars, which is still a reasonable amount. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing even more money in the following rounds."
