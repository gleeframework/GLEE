Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair.  I'm losing money every round we play with inflation, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than my last offer to reach an agreement. Time is running out, and it benefits us both to settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, but his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor.  While he's offering a ""compromise"", it's essential for Alice to hold strong. The longer the game goes, the more desperate Bob will become, pushing the potential deal closer to a more favorable outcome for Alice."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split that acknowledges the time pressure and the impact of inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, as Bob is clearly getting desperate. However, his ""final offer"" still favors him slightly.  There's a significant risk that Bob is bluffing and will be willing to negotiate further in the next round as the pressure of inflation intensifies. Alice should continue to hold strong."
