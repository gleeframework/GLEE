"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1 ratio""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3600 in real value. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting a fair deal and avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not 50/50 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains. With the 27.1% decrease in value, my gain of $3000 is actually worth around $2197 in real value.

Considering the previous offers, I'm not sure if I should take this one. The 3:7 ratio is still quite skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not sure if I should accept a deal that's not significantly better than the previous one.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer, considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting the lion's share, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm proposing a 20:80 ratio, where I get a smaller share, but it's still a better deal than the previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will take it, but I'm also preparing for the possibility that he'll reject it and we'll go to the next round."
