"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000. I think this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid losing value due to inflation. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both want a good deal and the money will depreciate with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation, this is a good deal for both""
}

I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 36% less than the original value, and trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
