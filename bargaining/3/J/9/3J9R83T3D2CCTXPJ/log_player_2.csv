"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work out a better deal later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  Let's see if we can negotiate something better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 60/40, but I don't think we'll get anywhere if we just keep splitting the difference.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if we can push for a more even split.  I'm not convinced 60/40 is the best solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about a 45/55 split?  This way we both get a good deal.""}
