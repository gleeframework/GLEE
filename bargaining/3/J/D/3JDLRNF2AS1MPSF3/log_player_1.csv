"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about the 5% reduction in Bob's offer. However, I don't want to wait for another round and risk losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
