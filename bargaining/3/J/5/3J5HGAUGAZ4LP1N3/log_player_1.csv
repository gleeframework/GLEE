"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was close, I'll make a counteroffer. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping it will be more appealing to Bob."
