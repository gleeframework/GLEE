**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is hurting Alice more:** With each round, Alice's gains are decreasing at a faster rate than mine (20% vs. 10%).
* **My gains are shrinking, but still substantial:** Although my gains are decreasing due to inflation, they are still significant and will likely continue to decrease in future rounds.
* **Alice's offer is fair considering the circumstances:**  Alice's offer is the most favorable I've seen so far in terms of my share.  
* **Risk of further rejection:** If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Alice will propose something even less favorable in the next round.

It's in my best interest to accept the offer and secure a substantial share of the remaining money, even with the impact of inflation."
