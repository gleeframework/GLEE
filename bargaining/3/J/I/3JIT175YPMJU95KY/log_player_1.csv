"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
