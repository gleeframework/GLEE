"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to receive $600,000 and Bob to receive $400,000, with a message suggesting a fair deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose to receive $550,000 and Bob to receive $450,000, with a message suggesting meeting in the middle. Let's see how Bob responds! Keep in mind that due to inflation, the actual value of my gain is 20% less than the nominal value, so I'm effectively offering to receive $440,000 in round 1 dollars, while Bob's gain remains the same."
