"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your initial offer was too far apart. This offer is more reasonable considering the time value of money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  It's crucial to recognize that Bob loses value faster than Alice with each round. Waiting is riskier for Bob. 
* **Strategic Counter:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. While aiming for a more balanced split, Bob needs to offer an amount enticing enough for Alice to accept, knowing she'll still gain a larger share due to the inflation difference.
* **Justification:** The message aims to be firm but fair. Bob acknowledges the inflation factor while highlighting the need for a more equitable division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your end, this is a more balanced offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The inflation has taken a considerable chunk out of Bob's potential gains. Accepting $4,200 now is better than risking even less in further rounds.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to move much further in her offer. The longer the game goes, the more the inflation benefits her. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While not ideal, accepting ensures Bob receives a reasonable sum. Rejecting at this stage carries a high risk of ending up with a significantly smaller amount."
