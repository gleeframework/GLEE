"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```
I'm offering to give Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'm effectively getting $57.50 now.

I accept Bob's offer:
