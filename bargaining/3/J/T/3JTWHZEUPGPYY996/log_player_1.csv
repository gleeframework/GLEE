"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy strategy in the first round. Since I don't know how Bob is affected by inflation, I'll try to maximize my share in this round, leaving him with just a symbolic amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, it's clear that Bob is not afraid to take a larger share. With inflation in play, accepting 500,000 is better than risking a smaller amount in later rounds."
