"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you $100000, a fair starting point. You can do better next round, I'm sure! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm feeling a bit greedy. A million dollars is a lot of money, and I'm willing to risk a round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling a bit more generous than you, Alice. Let's see if you're willing to play fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're being too stingy, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of! 
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating, the inflation is a real threat.  190,000 is a significant gain, and I'm not sure I can do better. It's time to secure the bag!"
