"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split! That's a fair offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a bit more for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
