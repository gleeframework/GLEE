This is a tough situation, but rejecting this offer is too risky. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Shrinking Value:** Your share is losing value extremely quickly. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems firm in his position and is unlikely to offer significantly more, especially knowing the inflation works in his favor.
* **Limited Rounds:** You are running out of rounds. Holding out for a better deal might result in getting nothing at all.

While $300,000 is significantly less than your initial offers, it's better than walking away with nothing when the alternative is increasingly bleak."
