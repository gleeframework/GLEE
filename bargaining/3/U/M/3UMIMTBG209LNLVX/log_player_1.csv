"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I'm not thrilled about getting only 300,000, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
