"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $7,000 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, which is $7,000 * 0.9 = $6,300. This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for less than I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I'm offering you $4,000 this time."
