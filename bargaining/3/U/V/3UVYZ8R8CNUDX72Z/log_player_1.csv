"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect me more.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split, as I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50-50 split, a fair and equal split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
