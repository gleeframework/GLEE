"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio, favoring your gain slightly in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's risky to accept such a lopsided offer in the first round.  There's a chance Alice might be bluffing, and I can potentially get a better deal later on, especially if I'm the one proposing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair compromise that accounts for my risk of rejecting your previous offer. It's also a good starting point for a potential agreement.""
}
