"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair compromise that accounts for my risk of rejecting your previous offer. It's also a good starting point for a potential agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
