"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'm sure we can find a better solution later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money's value will decrease by 20% for me, I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe this is a more fair division. Considering the money's value will keep decreasing for me, I'm willing to take a larger share now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe this is a fairer offer considering the inflation impacting you more than me. Let's reach a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the money's value has decreased significantly for me, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Alice's offer of 300,000 is not sufficient, considering I was willing to accept 600,000 in the previous round. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable offer. The decreasing value of money is a concern, but I'm willing to take that risk for a potentially better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in the money's value for me, I'm willing to compromise and offer a 50-50 split. This is a more reasonable offer, taking into account the impact of inflation on my share. I believe this is a fair deal, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.""}"
