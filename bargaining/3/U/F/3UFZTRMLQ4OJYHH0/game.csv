60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  How about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the time value of money with inflation.,Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate you considering inflation, Bob, I believe a more equitable split is still possible. Let's see what the next round brings.",Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Okay, Bob, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer slightly.  How about a 58/42 split?  This considers the time factor while still aiming for a reasonable balance.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
53.0,47.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The value is decreasing with each round. I'm offering you 53/47 - take it or leave it, but this is my final offer.",Bob,4,
,,"I understand your frustration, Bob, but I'm willing to gamble that we can still reach a more favorable outcome. Your offer doesn't reflect the faster rate of inflation affecting my share.",Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. 56/44 is my final offer.  Take it, and we both leave with something reasonable. Otherwise, we both lose.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
