Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation and Bob's previous proposal, I suggest a 55/45 split. This maintains a reasonable balance, giving Alice a slight advantage but also compensating Bob for potential risks. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
