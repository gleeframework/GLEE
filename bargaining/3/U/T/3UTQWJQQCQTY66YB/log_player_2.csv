Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is less than what I was previously offering, the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money she is getting, and there's a real risk of us both getting nothing if we keep rejecting. It's time to take a deal."
