"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're starting with $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $3,000 for me and $7,000 for him. It's not my ideal split, but it's better than going back to the drawing board."
