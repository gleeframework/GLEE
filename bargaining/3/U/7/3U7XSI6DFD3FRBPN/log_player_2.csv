Round 11
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** There's only one round left! If Bob rejects this offer, they both get nothing.
* **Reasonable Split:** Alice is offering a near-even split. While Bob could push for a slightly better deal in a perfect world, the risk of getting nothing is too high at this stage. 

It's a classic case of ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."""
