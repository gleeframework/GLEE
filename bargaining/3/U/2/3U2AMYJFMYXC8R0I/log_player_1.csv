I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  I'm taking into account that the money will be worth less in later rounds, so I'm hoping to secure most of it early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than mine from the previous round, even with the inflation considered. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a large share for myself. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm assuming he's more willing to compromise.  However, with the inflation factored in, I want to make sure I secure a substantial portion of the money."
