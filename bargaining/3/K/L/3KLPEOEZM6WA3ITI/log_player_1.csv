"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a classic 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty bold opening move, but I think it'll show Bob I'm serious about getting the lion's share of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is a big improvement from the first round, but it's still not enough for me.  I'm going to reject and see what happens in the next round!  I'm feeling confident that I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced 60/40 split in my favor.  Bob's last offer was a bit aggressive, so I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to compromise.  The inflation is starting to kick in, and I need to make sure I get a good chunk of the money before it's too late!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty fair considering the amount of inflation we've had. While I'd love to get more, it's not worth risking getting nothing.  A 50/50 split is a good way to ensure we both get something!"
