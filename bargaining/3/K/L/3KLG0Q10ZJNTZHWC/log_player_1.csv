"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair and simple solution. What do you think, Bob?"

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not very generous, but I'm getting a bit desperate to end this game. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
