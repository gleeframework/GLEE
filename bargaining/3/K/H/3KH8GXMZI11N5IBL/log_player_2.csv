"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Let's see if Alice can do better with her own proposal!  This is a good starting point, but I think I can get a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor. Let's end this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This deal makes sense considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to hurt and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
