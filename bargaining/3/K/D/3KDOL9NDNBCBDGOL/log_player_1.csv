"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit better than my initial one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, but still a good compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I think there's been a mistake! The inflation rate is 20% per round, so after 3 rounds, the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512 of its original value. This means I should be considering the money as worth 5,120 (10,000 * 0.512).

That being said, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is the same as my initial offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
