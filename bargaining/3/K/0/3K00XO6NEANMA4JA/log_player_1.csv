"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need to plan for the future and the money loses value quickly. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, I, as Alice, reject Bob's offer in Round 2 because, despite the explanation about planning for the future and the impact of inflation, the offer seems less favorable to me compared to my initial proposal. I initially suggested a split where I would gain $600,000 and Bob would gain $400,000, aiming for what I perceived as a fair division. Bob's counteroffer in Round 2, after adjusting for the inflation that affects his share, still shifts more of the total value towards him ($550,000 to him, $450,000 to me), which I find less acceptable than my original proposal. Given the rules of the game and the impact of inflation, I believe I can propose a better division in the next round that would be more favorable to me or at least closer to what I consider fair. Therefore, I decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this scenario, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share and my goal to achieve a division that I consider fair, I will make a new proposal. Since Bob's share of the money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I can adjust my offer to reflect this change while still aiming for a balance that I believe is reasonable.\n\n### {""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced offer.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer takes into account the devaluation of Bob's share due to inflation, while also trying to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties. By slightly increasing my share and decreasing Bob's share, I'm accounting for the loss of value his portion experiences, aiming to encourage acceptance and end the game on terms that are more favorable to me, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a critical point.  We both lose if we wait any longer. This offer is reasonable and avoids significant losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, despite Bob's message emphasizing the urgency and the potential for significant losses if we wait any longer, I choose to reject his offer in Round 4. The offer of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for Bob might seem more balanced than previous offers, especially considering the cumulative effect of inflation on Bob's share, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round. However, from my perspective, this offer is still less favorable compared to my previous proposal in Round 3, where I would gain $650,000.\n\n###\n\nGiven that my share of the money does not lose value over rounds, I have the advantage of patience in this game. Since Bob's share continues to devalue with each round, I anticipate that he will be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer in subsequent rounds rather than risk further devaluation of his potential gain. Therefore, I decide to reject Bob's offer in Round 4, with the strategy of either proposing a more favorable division for myself in the next round or leveraging the increasing pressure on Bob due to inflation to achieve a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this scenario, considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and my goal to achieve a division that is most favorable to me, I will make a new proposal. Given that Bob's share of the money continues to devalue with each passing round, while my share retains its value, I have the leverage to propose a division that allocates a larger portion to myself.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Given the current state of inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer reflects the strategic advantage I have due to the rules of the game, where my share of the money is not affected by inflation, unlike Bob's share. By proposing a division of $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob, I am taking into account the significant devaluation of Bob's potential gain over the rounds. My message aims to frame this offer as a reasonable adjustment, considering the current state of inflation and its unequal impact on our shares. I anticipate that the pressure of further potential losses due to inflation might incline Bob to accept this offer, ending the game on terms that are more favorable to me."
