"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90, you get 10. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a small amount to start, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 50-50 seems fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, my gain of 50 is worth 9 units (90% of 50) and Bob's gain of 50 is worth 40 units (80% of 50).

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of 45 is worth 4.05 units (90% of 45) and Bob's gain of 55 is worth 5.5 units (90% of 55).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. I'll take 45, you get 55. It's a good compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
