"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm leaving room for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and equal start! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal considering the circumstances.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
