"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","For round 2, my offer is worth 95% of the original, and Bob's offer is worth 90% of the original.

Since Bob's offer is now 6000 * 0.9 = 5400 for him, and 4000 * 0.95 = 3800 for me, I'll accept this offer.
