"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob a 45% share, which is slightly less than half, but still a significant amount. This way, I'll have a higher chance of getting a larger share, while also being somewhat fair to Bob. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and increase the chances of him accepting the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This round only. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, Bob's offer is still not favorable to me, as I would be getting only 40% of the original amount. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise. Additionally, Bob's message ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic"" implies that he's trying to make a one-time good offer, which makes me skeptical about his intentions.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob an equal share of 50%, hoping that he'll be willing to compromise and accept the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less to me in each round, I'm essentially offering Bob a slightly larger share in terms of value. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is a clear indication that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
