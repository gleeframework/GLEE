I'll start by offering Bob $1.  I know it's a ridiculously small amount, but I want to see if he'll accept it right away. I'm hoping he'll be greedy and think he can get more in the next round, which will actually result in him getting less because of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it seems like a tempting amount, I'm confident I can do better. I know that Bob is greedy and will likely keep pushing for a larger share, which will play into my favor thanks to inflation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this round. The inflation is starting to have a significant impact, and I'm confident that Bob won't be able to get much more than this.  I'm hoping that this will seem like a fair compromise to him."
