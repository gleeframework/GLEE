"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to give me a bit more, but still wants a bigger share for himself.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you such a large share, Bob. I think I deserve more!""
}
```

Your turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50-50 split is fair, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced and fair distribution of the $100."
