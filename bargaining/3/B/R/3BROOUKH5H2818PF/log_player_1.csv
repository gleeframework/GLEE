Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. This offer gives us both a good amount, and allows for some room to bargain in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, this offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation. It's better to take this than risk getting less later.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation, but I still believe we can find a more equitable split. This offer is fair, and allows us both to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims to understand inflation, his offers don't reflect that.  He's consistently aiming for a larger share, even though his value diminishes faster.  I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm aiming for a deal that acknowledges the shrinking pot, especially for him."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round makes the pie smaller, especially for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the dwindling value of the money. However, I think we can still find a better deal for both of us. This offer gives you a fair share, and it also helps me maximize my gains in this rapidly changing situation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is getting ridiculous. Bob finally acknowledges the inflation, but his actions don't match his words. He's trying to wear me down, hoping I'll panic and accept a worse deal as time runs out. I need to stay strong and call his bluff. He's losing value far quicker than I am, and he knows it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  We're both losing money by being stubborn.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. This is the final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law. Bob is clearly not negotiating in good faith.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially considering the rapidly diminishing returns. By making it my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He needs to realize that his delaying tactics will only hurt him more in the long run."
