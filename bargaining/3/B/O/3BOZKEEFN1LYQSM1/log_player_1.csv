"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you.  This seems fairer and allows us both to get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
