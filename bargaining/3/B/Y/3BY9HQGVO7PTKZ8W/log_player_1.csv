# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $4000 is actually equivalent to $3200 in the first round. Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again!
