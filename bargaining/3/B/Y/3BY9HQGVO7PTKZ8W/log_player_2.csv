"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's share fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more favorable split this time.  Let's wrap this up.""}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:**  Alice's money is devaluing faster than mine. By Round 2, her $6,000 is already worth less to her.
* **Stronger Position:** My rejection in Round 1 puts pressure on Alice. She knows I'm willing to walk away, and time is on my side.
* **Aiming High:** While this offer is tilted in my favor, it's not outrageously so.  There's a chance Alice will accept to avoid further losses from inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Working:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. Her offer is now a perfectly even split.
* **Guaranteed Gains:** While I could push for a slightly better deal in a future round, there's no guarantee Alice would offer more than $5,000. Accepting now locks in a fair amount. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** There's always a risk Alice calls my bluff in later rounds. Accepting a 50/50 split now is a safe and logical move."
