I'll start by offering Bob a small amount to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is more than fair, considering the inflation, but I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I want to see if I can convince him to take a bit less, or if I can push the deal further in my favor by offering a more appealing split with the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer an even split this round.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I think he's aiming for a larger share. This offer is fair and might make him more willing to accept, especially considering the potential for more inflation in the future."
