"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This seems like a fair starting point. Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so a fair split seems like the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the offer since the money is losing value quickly and a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point."
