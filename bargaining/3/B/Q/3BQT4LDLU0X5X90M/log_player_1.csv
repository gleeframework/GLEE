"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split, but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original value. So, in this round, I would gain $7,200 (8000 * 0.9) if I accept Bob's offer.

I'll think carefully about this proposal...

I'll decide to reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50-50 split is fair, especially considering the inflation effect on my end. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 81% of the original value ($8,100). Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up my edge!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is still a smaller share than I would have liked, but I'm hoping to maintain some leverage for future negotiations. My message is a bit more assertive, hinting that I'm not willing to give up my advantage easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 72.9% of the original value ($7,272). Considering the numbers, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it.

I'll decide to accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a relatively balanced split, and I'm not confident I can do better in the next round. I'm also considering the fact that the money is worth less and less with each passing round, so it's better to get something now rather than risking getting nothing."
