"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. It's fair, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
