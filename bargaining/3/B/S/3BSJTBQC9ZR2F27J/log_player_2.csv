"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to keep most of the money this round, but let's be fair. You get 10% to start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's tempting to take the $1000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's worth taking a gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle this time. It's fair, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains.""}
