Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split it 55/45. This is a fair compromise given the decreasing value of the money for me.  We can't keep going back and forth forever. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
