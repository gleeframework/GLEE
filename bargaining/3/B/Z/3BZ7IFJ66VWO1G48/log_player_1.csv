"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, where I get 80% of the total amount ($8,000) and Bob gets 20% ($2,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we need to take into account. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but considering the inflation and Bob's proposal, I'll accept this offer.
