"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. I'm sure we can both agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd rather try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm willing to give you a bit less. How about 45 for me and 55 for you?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept or reject my counter-offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority of the money, but I need something for myself. Accept this and let's end the game.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous to Bob, but I'm still trying to get a decent share for myself."
