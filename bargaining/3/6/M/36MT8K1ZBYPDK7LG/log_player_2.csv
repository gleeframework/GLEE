"Round 1
Alice's offer:

This offer isn't fair to me, Bob. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split, Alice. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn for a counter-offer. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than her first one, considering the money is worth less for her now. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close the deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a reasonable compromise. I'm taking a hit from inflation, let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, but with the inflation working against Alice, it's unlikely I'll get a much better offer.  It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting nothing later."
