"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's try for a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer in this round would be less valuable than in the previous round.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
