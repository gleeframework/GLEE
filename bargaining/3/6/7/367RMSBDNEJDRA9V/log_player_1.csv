"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money equally. This way, we both get a good start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less this round, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.50
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.50

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
