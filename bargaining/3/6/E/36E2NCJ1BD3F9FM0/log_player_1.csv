"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start with.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a better outcome for myself. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me! My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a new one. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too low for me, I'm looking for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better split, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased purchasing power. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```

This offer is a slight increase from my previous one, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not satisfied with the outcome. I want to get closer to 50%. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully about it. If I accept this offer, I'll get 55 dollars, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like, considering the reduced value of money. On the other hand, rejecting it might lead to an even worse outcome in future rounds.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it, but I'm not thrilled about it.""
}
```

I'm hoping that this will be the final round, and I can get some stability back."
