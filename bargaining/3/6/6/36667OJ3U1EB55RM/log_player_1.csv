"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking a bit more than half, but leaving Bob with something to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal.  I'm losing more than he is, so I'll reject and see if he gets any more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 85/15.  While I'm still taking the majority, I want to show I'm willing to compromise and hopefully get this deal done before the inflation eats away at our potential gains too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my last proposal, and inflation is hitting me harder. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to 80/20. Inflation is becoming a serious factor now, and I need to secure a deal before things get worse. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a larger share, but hopefully, it's enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While inflation is hurting me, I still think I can get a better deal. Bob is being stubborn, but hopefully, he'll come around in the next round. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic decrease in my share just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering 75/25. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm feeling the pressure of inflation.  Hopefully, Bob sees that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation is hitting me hard, I can't afford to be stubborn anymore. Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is fair given the current situation. Accepting this offer means I still get something, rather than risking getting nothing at all."
