"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm keeping $80 for myself, which is 80% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $80 from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'm effectively getting $76.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. I'm getting $70, which is a good chunk of the remaining money. I'll take it!
