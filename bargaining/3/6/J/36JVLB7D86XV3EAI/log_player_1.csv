"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nHow's that? I offered Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a reasonable and fair share. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal. Let's see what he has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a more equitable split, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Considering that the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I believe I deserve a larger share. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share to 650,000, while offering Bob 350,000. Given that the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I believe this offer is more than fair. I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth the same to me, but its value is decreasing for Bob. Let's see how Bob responds to this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, considering the impact of inflation on my share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of an equal split. While Bob's share is worth 48.8% less than in the first round due to inflation, my share remains unaffected. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob. I'll proceed to the next round to try and get a more favorable offer."

Considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I believe my offer is generous. I'm taking into account the fact that the money is still worth the same to me, but its value is rapidly decreasing for Bob. Let's see how Bob responds to this proposal!"
