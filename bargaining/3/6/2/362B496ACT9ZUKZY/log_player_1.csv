"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  Time is money!""
}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer for myself, understanding that the value of the money decreases faster for Bob. This approach aims to incentivize Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better balance 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not in my best interest. The decreasing value of the money hurts him more than me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round to keep the pressure on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This offer is fair and avoids further losses from inflation for both of us, Bob. Let's close the deal.""
}
```

I'm slightly adjusting my offer towards a more even split, but keeping it advantageous for me.  The message emphasizes the time pressure and the shrinking pot due to inflation.  This hopefully nudges Bob to accept a deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Bob is stubbornly holding out for a better deal, but the inflation is quickly eroding the value of the money. While this offer is still slightly in Bob's favor considering the present value, further delays will only hurt both of us. It's time to cut my losses and accept."
