"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, I'll adjust my gain accordingly.

In round 1, I offered $8,000, which is now worth 80% of the original amount. So, in round 2, I'd be getting 80% of $6,000, which is $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
