Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share due to the inflation, but my loss is also significant. This offer is a compromise to move things forward.

In the first round, I offered a 60-40 split, and now Bob is offering a 55-45 split. Although Bob's offer seems reasonable, I should try to negotiate for a better deal to offset the effect of inflation.
