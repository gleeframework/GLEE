Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be a bit greedy on the first round, but I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and see the value in getting something rather than nothing.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair offer, and it's better than getting nothing. I'll take it!"
