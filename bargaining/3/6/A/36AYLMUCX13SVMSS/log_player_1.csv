"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself, hoping it's a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Since the offer is still a 60/40 split, but with a slightly better share for me, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
