"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 40 dollars in this round is equivalent to 36 dollars in the first round.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
