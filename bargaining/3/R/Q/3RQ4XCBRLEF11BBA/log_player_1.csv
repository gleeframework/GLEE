"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself the lion's share in the first round. This should be attractive enough for Bob to consider, especially with the inflation factor working against him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, and the inflation factor is now working in my favor.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split,  increasing my share from the first round, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  The inflation should be making him more willing to accept a deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite bad, and the inflation is working heavily against him now. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is fair given the current inflation rates and should be more appealing to Bob than his last offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and end the game."
