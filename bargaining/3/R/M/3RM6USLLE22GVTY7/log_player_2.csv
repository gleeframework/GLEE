Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While the offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor, taking a mere $200,000 now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds.  

This highlights the power dynamic in this game: Alice is unaffected by time pressure, giving her a significant advantage in negotiations."
