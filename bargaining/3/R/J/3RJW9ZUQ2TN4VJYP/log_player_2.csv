"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get something to start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While getting something is better than nothing, I have a strong chance of securing a much better deal in the following rounds due to the steep rate at which the money devalues for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, considering the time pressure and devaluation. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take a smaller share now, but hopefully, we can avoid the further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not in my favor, especially considering the rapid devaluation of her share.  She's clearly feeling the pressure and is willing to make concessions. I believe I can push for a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a strong offer, and the devaluation will only hurt us both further. Let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and avoid further risk. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is fair at this point. The devaluation is significant for both of us, and continuing to push for a larger share risks us ending up with nothing."
