"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this time, as I'm sure you'll appreciate the slight inflation advantage I have. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since I don't know the inflation effect on Bob, I'll have to make a decision based on my current situation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to adjust my proposal to make it more favorable for myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly better deal to account for inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
