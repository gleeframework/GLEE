Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight adjustment to give me a bit more. Here's my offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of 42 is now worth even less than before. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Alice's offer is still close to the initial ratio, I'll try to push for a slightly better split. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim to get a better share. Since Alice's offer was 42/58, I'll try to get closer to 50/50. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}"
