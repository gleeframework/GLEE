I'll start with a proposal that gives me a larger share, but still leaves something for Bob. This might incentivize him to accept, but if not, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is very unfair to me. I'll reject and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'll propose a 50/50 split. This is fair and reasonable, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept."
