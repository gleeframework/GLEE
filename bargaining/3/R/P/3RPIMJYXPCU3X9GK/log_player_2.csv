"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can always adjust later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While it seems tempting to get something now, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in later rounds as the money will be worth significantly less to Alice as time goes on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's a very generous offer, Alice, but how about we split things a bit more evenly this time?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is working in my favor more than hers, so I'm willing to gamble on another rejection and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's try to find some middle ground. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's closer to even and accounts for the time pressure we're both under.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time.  It's the fairest way to go, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally agreeing to a 50/50 split. This is a good deal for me considering the inflation and the fact that we are already halfway through the rounds. Accepting now guarantees I walk away with a reasonable share, and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to agree."
