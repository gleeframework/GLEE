"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start, hoping to end the game quickly.  I figure he might accept since he doesn't know about the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even though I'm getting a smaller share, I know the money will be worth less in the next round due to inflation.  I need to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer a bit, but still try to keep most of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to take this before the value of his share decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  While I'm getting more than in the previous round, I know the money will continue to lose value rapidly.  I need to push for a better deal before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to try to increase my offer again, aiming for a 70/30 split. While the inflation is hurting me, I still believe there's room for a deal where we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While the inflation is hurting me, I'm hoping Bob will realize that if he keeps rejecting offers, he'll end up with nothing. I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal, hoping he'll start being more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer once more, but this time I'm going to push for a 60/40 split. The inflation is becoming a serious problem, so I need to secure a deal before it's too late. I'm hoping Bob will see that if he continues to reject offers, we both might end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm not giving up just yet. I believe I can still secure a better deal.  I'm holding out hope that Bob will start to see the value of reaching an agreement.  We're both losing money with each passing round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This is getting very risky. I'm going to try a 50/50 split. The inflation is eating away at my potential earnings, and I need to secure a deal quickly. I'm hoping Bob will realize that a 50/50 split is better than nothing, especially with the rapidly diminishing value of the money."
