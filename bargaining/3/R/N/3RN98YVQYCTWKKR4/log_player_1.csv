"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet Bob halfway just yet. I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40%, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal, while still being willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not willing to wait for a better offer, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll take 40% and call it a day."
