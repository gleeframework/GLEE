"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering I'm making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'll offer 85/15 this time.  This is still a decent gain for me, and I'm hoping it's enough to tempt Bob into accepting, considering he rejected my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I'll reject again and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a 80/20 split.  The inflation is making things tough, but I think this is the best I can do to secure a decent portion of the money.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's better than his last offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are steadily getting worse.  Inflation is really impacting my potential gains, but I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and try to get a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, but I need to secure something.  I'm offering 75/25, which is still a significant portion of the remaining value.  I hope this is enough to convince Bob to accept, as the clock is ticking and the value of the money continues to decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming less and less attractive, and the inflation is taking a serious toll. I'm not happy about it, but I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This is getting desperate. I'm offering 70/30. Inflation is cutting deeply, but I need to get something. This is my last chance to propose, after this round Bob gets to decide."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While the inflation has severely diminished the value of the money, it's better than getting nothing at all. Bob's offers have been steadily decreasing, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's time to take what I can get."
