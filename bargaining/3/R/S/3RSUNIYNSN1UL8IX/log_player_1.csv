"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, I'll try to be more aggressive this time 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being aggressive!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $20, which is worth 20% of the original $100, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 20% of $100 / 1.1 (10% inflation) = $18.18. Not bad, but I could do better.

However, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You were too aggressive, now it's my turn to be tough!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, $20, which is worth 20% of the original $100, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 20% of $100 / 1.1^2 = $16.36. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more games 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be more reasonable now!

Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $50, which is worth 50% of the original $100, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 50% of $100 / 1.1^3 = $33.64. That's not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, I'm willing to take a break from the negotiations and accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
