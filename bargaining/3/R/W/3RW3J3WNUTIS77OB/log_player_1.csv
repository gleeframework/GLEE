Let's start fair!  I propose we split the money evenly."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of the inflation.  I'll take 55 dollars, which is more than Bob's offer."

I'm not going to accept that!  I'm still worth more than Bob's offer. I'm going to try to make a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Even though inflation is hurting me, Bob's offer is ridiculously low.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm taking a bigger risk here, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better for him to accept this offer than to wait and see what happens in the next round.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm going to lose a lot more money if this goes on much longer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

This is getting ridiculous! Bob is taking advantage of inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm going for broke here.  I know the inflation is hurting me, but I need to make a stand.  I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, and I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to take something than to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is outrageous! Bob is taking advantage of the inflation and offering me a pittance. I'm not going to accept this. I'm better off taking my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is my final offer.  Inflation is hurting me badly now.  But I'm still willing to give Bob 10 dollars.  He'll have to decide if he wants to take it, or risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
