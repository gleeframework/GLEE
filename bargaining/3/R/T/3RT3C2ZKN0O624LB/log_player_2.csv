"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible offer! While it's a million dollars, it's only a single dollar for Bob. There's no way this is worth it.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair deal, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection and having to deal with potential inflation."
