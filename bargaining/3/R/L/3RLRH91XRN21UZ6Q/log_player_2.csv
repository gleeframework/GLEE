"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it appears ""fair"" at first glance, the inflation rates mean that I'll actually get less than 400,000 in real terms due to the 20% depreciation. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a 450,000 split.  This considers the inflation, and while it's not an even split, it's a more favorable outcome for both of us than the previous offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, this is a more balanced split now. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite, and I'm not sure I can secure a better deal in the next round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me some value, even with the inflation."
