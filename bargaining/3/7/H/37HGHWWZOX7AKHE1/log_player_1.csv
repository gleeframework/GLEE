I propose to take $9,000, leaving $1,000 for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept that.  After all, it's a lot better than nothing if he rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,000, it's still a huge loss compared to what I initially proposed.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than nothing, it's still far less than what I think I deserve.  He seems to be playing a game of chicken here, and I'm not going to cave in so easily.  Let's see if he'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round."

I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet. I'm offering $6,500 for myself and $3,500 for Bob.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept."

While I'm not happy with the 50/50 split, given the significant impact of inflation, I have no choice but to accept. It's better than getting nothing, which is the risk we're both facing at this point."
