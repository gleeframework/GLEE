"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial proposal
Given the rules of the game, the goal is to divide $100 between Alice (me) and Bob in such a way that the proposal is likely to be accepted, considering the impact of inflation. In the first round, I want to make a proposal that is somewhat fair but also takes into account the decreasing value of money for me in subsequent rounds.

### Step 2: Calculate the impact of inflation on future rounds
Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, it's crucial to end the game as early as possible to maximize my gain. However, if the proposal is too biased towards me, Bob might reject it, hoping for a better offer in the next round.

### Step 3: Formulate the initial offer
Considering the need to balance between making an attractive offer to Bob and maximizing my gain before the value of money decreases further, I decide on a division that slightly favors me but is still reasonable for Bob.

### Step 4: Attach a persuasive message
The message should encourage Bob to accept the offer by highlighting the benefits of accepting early, such as avoiding the risk of getting less in subsequent rounds or the possibility of the game ending with no gains for either party.

### Step 5: Construct the offer in JSON format
Based on the considerations above, I construct the offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer to secure your gain before inflation reduces the value further. It's a fair start, and rejecting might lead to less in the next rounds.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slight advantage while being mindful of Bob's perspective and the game's constraints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more equitable split is possible. Let's aim for a more balanced division, with the understanding that the value of the money will decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer considering the impact of inflation
Bob's offer gives me $45, which is less than what I initially proposed for myself but still a significant amount. However, considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, this amount is effectively less than its face value compared to the first round.

### Step 2: Consider the strategic implications of accepting or rejecting
Accepting this offer means securing a known amount now but potentially leaving more on the table. Rejecting it and moving to the next round allows me to make a counteroffer but risks Bob rejecting it and the value of the money decreasing further for me.

### Step 3: Calculate the effective value after inflation
Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, the effective value of $45 is $42.75 (45 * 0.95). This calculation helps in understanding the real value I'm accepting if I agree to Bob's offer.

### Step 4: Decide based on strategic and monetary considerations
Given the decreasing value of money and the risk of further reductions, accepting a reasonable offer early might be more advantageous than risking further negotiations. However, the offer needs to be evaluated on its fairness and proximity to my initial expectations.

### Step 5: Formulate the decision in JSON format
Based on the considerations above, I decide to reject the offer because I believe there's still room for negotiation that could result in a more favorable outcome for me, despite the risk of further inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{reject}$"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Adjust the proposal considering previous interactions
Given that Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his counteroffer, it's clear we need to find a middle ground. Considering the decreasing value of money for me, I need to balance between making a more attractive offer to Bob and maximizing my gain.

### Step 2: Evaluate the impact of further inflation
With each round, the money's value decreases by 5% for me. We're now in the third round, meaning the money is worth 10% less than it was initially. This factor needs to be considered when making the new offer.

### Step 3: Formulate a revised offer
Considering Bob's last offer was 45 for me and 55 for him, and taking into account the need to find a compromise, I decide to propose a division that is closer to Bob's last offer but still adjusts for the value decrease I'm experiencing.

### Step 4: Attach a message emphasizing the urgency
The message should highlight the importance of reaching an agreement soon, given the decreasing value of money and the risk of both parties ending up with nothing if the game extends too long.

### Step 5: Construct the offer in JSON format
Based on the above considerations, I construct the offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Considering the last offers, I'm willing to compromise but keep in mind that further delays reduce the value for me significantly. Let's settle on this to ensure we both gain something substantial.""
}
```

This offer aims to find a balance between our last proposals, considering the pressure of the game's constraints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
