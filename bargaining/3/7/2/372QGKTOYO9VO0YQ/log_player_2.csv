"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a little more since I'm the one making the offer, but we can adjust later if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation, the money is worth less for me, but I think I can get a better deal than 40%. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's adjust for the decrease in value!""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. This offer accounts for both inflation and the fact that you're the one making the proposal this round. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the 45% I'd get is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. However, Alice is also affected by the inflation, and the difference between our losses is significant. Given that the gap between our proposals is narrowing and the increasing loss of value, I think it's time to accept this offer before the money loses even more value.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
