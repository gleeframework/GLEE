"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable 58/42 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the new offer, I'm still not thrilled about the 65/35 split, but I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make another proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 380000, ""bob_gain"": 620000}

I'm trying to find a balance between the decreasing value of my gains and the desire for a more favorable split. This 62/38 split might be a compromise."
