Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this a little more evenly. I'm willing to go first and make a fair offer.  This way, we can avoid losing too much money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
