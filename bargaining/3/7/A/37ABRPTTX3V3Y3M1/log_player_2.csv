"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split close to 50/50, but I get a little extra since the value decreases over time for me. This way we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is close to 50/50, the inflation penalty on Bob's side means that 4500$ will be worth significantly less in the future. Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making his own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to offer you 4800$, which is still a fair split. It's important that we both get something, and since the value of the money will decrease for me, I need a little more to make it worthwhile. Let's be reasonable and finish this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but the decreasing value puts me at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take a small step back from my initial offer, ensuring a fairer outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's gains have been reduced significantly by inflation. This offer provides a reasonable outcome, considering the diminishing value of money for Bob. Accepting ensures he receives a decent amount while avoiding further losses due to inflation."
