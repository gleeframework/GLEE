"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars and leave 400,000 dollars for Bob. It's a pretty straightforward split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid any further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 dollars is actually worth 450,000 dollars in real terms.

I'll think for a moment... Hmm, Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which is a pretty fair deal. I'm not sure if I can do better, and the inflation is making my gains worth less with each round. I'll accept this offer.
