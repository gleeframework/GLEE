I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything. Bob will be losing value much faster than me, so I'm hoping he'll accept even a small amount.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, and I'm not sure I can do better. Even though I'm not losing any value, I'd rather take the guaranteed 500,000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
