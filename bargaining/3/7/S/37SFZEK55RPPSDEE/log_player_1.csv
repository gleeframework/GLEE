"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n
I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. This way, we both get a decent share, and it's a relatively fair start. Your turn, Bob!\n\n

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n
I'm not accepting this offer. Considering the inflation rates, accepting 40 dollars now would be worth even less to me than it appears. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round, hoping to get a better deal despite the decreasing value of the money.\n\n

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground.""}\n\n

Given the inflation rates and the fact that Bob was willing to offer me 40 dollars in the previous round, I'm adjusting my proposal to aim for a middle ground. I'll slightly decrease my share from the initial offer, hoping Bob will find this more acceptable, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Your turn, Bob!\n\n

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but it won't get better for either of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n

Considering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation (48.8% less than the initial round), and Bob's message that this is his final offer, I believe accepting 45 dollars now is the best choice. The money's value is decreasing rapidly for me, and the risk of getting a worse deal or the game not ending in a mutually beneficial agreement is too high. Accepting now secures some value for me, even if it's not the initial amount I hoped for.\n\n
