Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a more even split, considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's call it a day 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. A 50-50 split seems reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game."
