"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on, while the inflation is still low."

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

# Bob gain: 85

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the inflation is impacting me more heavily, I'm still holding out for a better deal. This offer is still too lopsided in Bob's favor, and there are still several rounds left. I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement."

The inflation is really starting to take its toll, especially on Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided offer. We are both getting closer to getting nothing at all, so I'm hoping to find a more balanced solution in the next round."

Round 9

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

We're getting very close to the end now, and the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money. I'm making a significant compromise to try and secure a deal. I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still aiming for a larger portion for myself. This might be our last chance to get anything."
