"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, Bob. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to potentially get more than $40. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more than half since the money loses more value for you than me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The tides have turned, Bob.  I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, the original $100 is now worth less to both of us, but more significantly to Alice. Given that Alice is offering me $45, which is more than my last proposal to her, and taking into account the decreasing value of the money, I think it's wise to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
