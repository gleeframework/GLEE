"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob offered me, but I'm also acknowledging that the inflation is going to hit him harder than me.  Let's see if this gets us closer to an agreement!"
