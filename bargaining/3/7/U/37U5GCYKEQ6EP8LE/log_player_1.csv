"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get a little more. This is my offer, and if you want to take more, you'll have to wait until next round, but the money will be worth less for you then. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob is trying to squeeze me knowing the value decreases for me each round. However, his offer is still significantly better for him. I'll take a risk and try to get a better deal in the next round.
