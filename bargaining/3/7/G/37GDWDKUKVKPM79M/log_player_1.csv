Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced you're willing to split fairly. I'm offering a more modest share to you this time. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I need a bit more than 30 to make this worthwhile for me.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, given the inflation and Bob's stubbornness, accepting is likely the best choice.  It's better to take a slightly smaller share than risk getting nothing at all in a later round."
