"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is not as favorable to me as my previous offer. However, it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.

I accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
