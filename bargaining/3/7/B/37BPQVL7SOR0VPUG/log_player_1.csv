Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more advantageous offer this time. Here's my proposal:

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the value of the money continuing to drop, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

I'm trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a bigger share of the remaining value."
