# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet. I'll think about it for a moment...

```

}
```

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 50/50 split, but I think I can do better than that. Take this and we can end the game!""
}

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer! With the reduced value, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions. I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. $600,000 is a decent share, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll take it and end the game!"
