"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000 dollars is something, it's worth considering the inflation factor. Even if Alice is unaware of it, it's better to try and negotiate a better deal, especially since I have the power to reject and propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the value of money might change.  Let's be reasonable and end this early.""
