Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have to share the money. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
