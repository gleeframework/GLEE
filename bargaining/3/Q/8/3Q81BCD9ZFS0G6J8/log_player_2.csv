"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. It's a fair starting point and gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is decent, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll see if Alice is willing to give me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have to share the money. Let's see if we can make this work.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate."
