Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, my gain of 50% of the new value is actually worth 40% of the original $100.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to meet halfway just yet. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
