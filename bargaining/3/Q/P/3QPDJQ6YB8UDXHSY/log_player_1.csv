# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer seems very lopsided in his favor. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I don't think I'll accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still very unfair. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the risk I'm taking by rejecting previous offers. I'll keep negotiating!"

I'm getting frustrated with Bob's offers. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and his offers are getting increasingly unfair.
