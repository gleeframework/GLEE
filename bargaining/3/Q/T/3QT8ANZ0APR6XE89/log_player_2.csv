"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90%, you take 10%.  We can always adjust in later rounds if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's offer is too one-sided, and I think we can do better. I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a more favorable split, even if it means the money is worth a bit less in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, taking into account that the money is worth a bit less in this round, but still trying to get a better deal than the initial 10% offer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split. I think 60-40 is a good starting point, considering the decreasing value of money.""}"
