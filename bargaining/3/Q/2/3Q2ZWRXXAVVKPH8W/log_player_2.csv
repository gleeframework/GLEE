Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, let's meet in the middle, 58-42 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 52/48 was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a risk. 57-43 is my counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the deal is getting significantly worse with each round. Accepting a 4300 cut is better than risking getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing, in the later rounds."
