"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Fair share for both of us""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. This is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair share and accept it, rather than risking a decrease in value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be real, Alice. I make this offer for a smooth game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I believe I can get a better deal. While the offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I'm not willing to settle for less than half, especially considering the significant amount of money at stake. I'm willing to risk another round of inflation to try to negotiate a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 575000,
  ""bob_gain"": 425000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob""
}
```

Considering the effects of inflation, the total value of the money has decreased. However, I'm still willing to offer Bob a significant share. I've decreased my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher share, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise and accept it, rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. Don't be greedy. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Considering the effects of inflation, I'm willing to take the risk of another round to try to get a more favorable offer. Bob's message about time running out is an attempt to pressure me, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 562500,
  ""bob_gain"": 437500,
  ""message"": ""Split the difference, last chance""
}
```

Considering the increasing effects of inflation, I'm making a more conciliatory offer, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to find a mutually acceptable solution and accept it, rather than risking further devaluation."
