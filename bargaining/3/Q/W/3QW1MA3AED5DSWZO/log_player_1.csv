"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Take 10% and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob 10% of the original amount, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with 90% of the original amount. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate and come up with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness, Alice. Let's split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amount I would gain in this round is 500000 * 0.9 = 450000.

I'm not sure if Bob's proposal is fair, considering the inflation effect. If we split the money evenly, I would still be losing value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the actual amount I would gain in this round is 450000 * 0.9 = 405000.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, Bob. But I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still a decent amount considering the inflation effect. The message is a lighthearted one, trying to keep the negotiation friendly."
