"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the remaining 10% in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion of the initial amount, but I'm being generous and giving him a chance to accept and split the remaining 10% in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in the first round. I'll take a bigger share now. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a tougher negotiation!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I need to be more careful with my decision. With this offer, I'll be getting 300,000 dollars, which is worth 90% of 300,000 (due to the 10% inflation), or 270,000 dollars in real terms.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll play it safe for now. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more realistic now. This is a fair split considering the remaining amount.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being more realistic, but I'm not going to give up yet. I'll try to squeeze a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll be getting 200,000 dollars, which is worth 72.9% of 200,000 (due to the 27.1% inflation), or 145,800 dollars in real terms.

Considering the significant reduction in my potential gain, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
