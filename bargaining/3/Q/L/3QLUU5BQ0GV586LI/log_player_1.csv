"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: $570,000 (95% of $600,000)
Bob's gain: $380,000 (95% of $400,000)

Bob's proposal for Round 2 is to split the money evenly, which would give me $750,000 and Bob $250,000. That's a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and make my next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a little low, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $700,000, which is a bit more than the $570,000 I would have gotten in Round 2. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting too greedy, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less after the first 3 rounds, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: $517,800 (86.74% of $600,000)
Bob's gain: $348,000 (86.74% of $400,000)

Bob's proposal for Round 4 is to give me $300,000 and take $700,000 for himself. I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept such a low offer, but I'll have to consider it.

However, I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll make my next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to $550,000, which is a bit more than the $517,800 I would have gotten in Round 4. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to a deal, indeed! But I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 22.62% less after the first 5 rounds, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: $464,440 (46.38% of $1,000,000)
Bob's gain: $545,560 (54.62% of $1,000,000)

Bob's proposal for Round 6 is to give me $450,000 and take $550,000 for himself. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept it. However, I'm getting a bit desperate, and the inflation is eating away at the value of the money.

I'll accept this offer.
