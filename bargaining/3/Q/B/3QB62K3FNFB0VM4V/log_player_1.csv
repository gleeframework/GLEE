"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not accepting your generous offer. I'll take a bigger share this round! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is being aggressive!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me in Round 2, I'll have to reassess the offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's too skewed in his favor. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to negotiate a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a fair share. Think about it!""
}
```

I've adjusted my proposal to give me a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further. The money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I need to be mindful of that when making my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced by your compromise. I'll try to get a better deal this round! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still pushing for a larger share.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means I'll get even less than I initially thought. However, I still need to make a decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the inflation, I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value. I'll keep negotiating to try to get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target. Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I've adjusted my proposal to give me a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I need to be cautious not to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll try to get a better deal this round! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still pushing for a larger share.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, which means I'll get significantly less than I initially thought. However, I need to make a decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the inflation, I think I can do better than 48% of the remaining value. I'll keep negotiating to try to get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and even division of the remaining money. The money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the value is decreasing rapidly."
