# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, and I need to think carefully about this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still need a decent share!""

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
