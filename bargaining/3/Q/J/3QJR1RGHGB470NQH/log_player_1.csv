I propose keeping $9,000 for myself and giving Bob $1,000. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point and that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want a significant portion of the money."
