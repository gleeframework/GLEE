"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is $200,000, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $800,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think 60/40 is a better split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to do better this time.

Considering the inflation, I'll offer Bob a smaller share, but I'll try to make it more appealing by offering a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal this time. 45% is a fair share, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still keeping a bit of a buffer for myself."
