"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's not too greedy. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him. I'll reject this offer and propose something fairer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is a compromise. I'm willing to give Bob a bit more to avoid further rounds of negotiation and the potential for inflation to further decrease the value of our gains."
