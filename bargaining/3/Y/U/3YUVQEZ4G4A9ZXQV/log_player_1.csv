"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's better to get something now than to risk getting less in future rounds."
