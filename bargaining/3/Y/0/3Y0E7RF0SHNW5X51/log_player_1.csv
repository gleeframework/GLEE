Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more fairly.  I'm offering you 40% and I'll take 60%. This accounts for the future inflation, and allows us both to get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
