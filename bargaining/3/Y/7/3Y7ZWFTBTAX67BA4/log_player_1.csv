"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is my first offer. I am taking the lion's share, but I am willing to share a small portion with Bob. Let's see if he's agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. I know inflation is a factor, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially since it was my offer that was rejected in the previous round. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm lowering my share to 720,000, but I'm still offering a sizable portion to Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure my own gains are still significant, especially considering inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous.  I'm not accepting this offer. While my gain is worth less due to inflation, Bob's isn't.  I'll hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

I'm still adjusting to the inflation, but I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept. This is the last round where my share will be worth more than 500,000, so I'm trying to be as generous as I can while still securing a good deal for myself."
