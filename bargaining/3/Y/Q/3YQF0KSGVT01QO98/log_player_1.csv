"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money while still providing Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept the offer, avoiding the risk of inflation that will affect him more significantly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, accepting it is the best course of action. 

- My gains are lower than my initial proposal, but it's still a significant amount.
- Continuing to reject offers could result in even lower gains for me as the inflation rate for Bob continues to increase.

The risk of losing more money to inflation outweighs the desire to get a larger share in the initial proposal."
