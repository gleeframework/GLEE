Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is significantly impacting my share. I'm willing to accept a smaller portion of the actual money, but I need a larger portion upfront to compensate for the devaluation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer in terms of the nominal dollar amount, the impact of inflation has significantly eroded the real value of her share. 

* **Time Sensitivity:**  We are now past the halfway point of the negotiations. Continuing to reject offers increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Alice's Perspective:** Alice is acutely aware that every round makes the deal significantly worse for her. Her willingness to accept this offer, even though it's nominally the same as round 1, demonstrates her understanding of the diminishing value.

**It's a good time to accept and secure a reasonable payout.**"
