"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially with the money being worth less due to inflation.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'm looking for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially since I'm the one who rejected the previous offers.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm also being cautious since the money is worth less and there are fewer rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 67.23% less than the original amount, I'm looking for a better deal.

However, considering the low value of the money and the limited number of rounds left, I'll accept this offer. I don't want to risk going into the final rounds with a lower amount of money.
