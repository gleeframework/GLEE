Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting offer was a bit lopsided. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This recognizes the impact of inflation on my share as rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
