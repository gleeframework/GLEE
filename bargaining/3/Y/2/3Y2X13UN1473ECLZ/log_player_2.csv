"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take most, but you get something to start with. Let's see how this plays out. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept such a lopsided offer right away, especially with inflation looming.  Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good starting point, and we can see how inflation plays out from here.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get more than a 50/50 split. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not an ideal split, accepting this offer means we both get something, and the inflation impact isn't as severe yet.  It's better to secure a decent gain now than risk getting nothing later."
