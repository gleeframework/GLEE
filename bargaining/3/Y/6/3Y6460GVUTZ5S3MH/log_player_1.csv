"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering we don't know each other's negotiation styles yet. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I still think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 2000 is now effectively 1600.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 40% less than the initial $10,000, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since the money is worth less now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now! With the money being worth 48.8% less than the initial $10,000, my gain of 3000 is now effectively 1900.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept such a small share.
