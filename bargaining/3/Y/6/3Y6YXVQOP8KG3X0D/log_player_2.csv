"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I believe a 50/50 split would be equitable. This maintains a balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
