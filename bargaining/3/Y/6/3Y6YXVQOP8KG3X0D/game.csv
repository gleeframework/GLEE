40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Considering the inflation, I believe a 50/50 split would be equitable. This maintains a balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round.",Alice,3,
