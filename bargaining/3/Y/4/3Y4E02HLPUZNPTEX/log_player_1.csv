"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your generosity is appreciated, but let's be fair. We both lose if this drags on. How about an even split after I take a slightly larger share to compensate for the risk in round 1? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
