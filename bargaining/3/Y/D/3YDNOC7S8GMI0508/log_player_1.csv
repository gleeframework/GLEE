I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on. I'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, it's better to take the 5000 now. If I reject, Bob gets to propose again, and he might not offer me that much in the next round due to inflation. It's a risk I'm not willing to take."
