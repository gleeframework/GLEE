"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This gives me a decent chunk of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about this offer... I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to keep the game going to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreasing value of my share, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking going to the next round with even less value.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
