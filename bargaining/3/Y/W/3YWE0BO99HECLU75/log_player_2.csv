"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. This offer is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money is worth less to Alice with each round, I might be able to secure more for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the money will be worth less to you in the next round. Let's close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn and time is running out.  This offer is still good for us both, but I need to get us moving towards a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  While Alice's offer is tempting, I think I can get a larger share of the money in the next round, especially since inflation is hurting her more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to maximize my gains as well.  Accept this and we can both walk away with something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this now. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is the most logical at this point.  We're running out of time and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Alice.  It's better to accept a fair deal than risk losing everything."
