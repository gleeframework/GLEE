"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you 300k, a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to negotiate further in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to split it evenly, but I'll give you a slight discount. You can do better than that, right?""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, while still being somewhat generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share this time, but we need to make a deal soon before inflation eats away at our gains! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 40% of what I would have gotten in the first round. It's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal. You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and holding out for a better deal."
