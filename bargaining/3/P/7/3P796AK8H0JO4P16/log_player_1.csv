"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. A 60/40 split seems reasonable, given the potential for the money to lose value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
