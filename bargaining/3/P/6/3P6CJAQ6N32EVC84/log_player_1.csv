"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share of $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. The message is a bit of a warning, as I'm trying to get a good deal from the start!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk losing out on any money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
