"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the amount equally considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's proposal seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  In the next round, Bob's offer will be worth 10% less to Alice, giving Bob more leverage.  It's worth seeing if Bob can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share of the money, considering the inflation in future rounds.""
