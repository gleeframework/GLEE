Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. This offer accounts for the time value of money.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't want 60-40, now it's 65-35. The longer we wait, the less you'll get.

# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken 60-40 when you had the chance. Now it's 70-30. Time is on my side. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Although far from ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $30 is better than risking getting $0 in the next round.  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me, and Alice seems content to wait me out. Taking the $30 now cuts my losses."
