"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'm not sure if 4000 is a good deal for me. But at the same time, I don't want to give up too much to Bob. 

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance this time. You'll get less, but I need to protect my value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains! With the money worth 14.26% less, I need to be careful about how I allocate the remaining funds. Bob's offer is a bit better than before, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer, considering the increasing inflation. Since the money is worth 19.51% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get an even larger share.

```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my best offer yet 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money worth 22.62% less, I need to be very cautious. Bob's offer is a bit better than before, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me.

However, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk losing everything. I'll take a chance on this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
