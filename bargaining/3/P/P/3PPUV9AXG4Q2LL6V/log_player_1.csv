"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the effective gains in the new currency.

In this round, I would gain 50 units of the new currency, which is equivalent to 45 units of the original currency (since 50 / 1.1 = 45.45, but I'll round down to 45 for simplicity).

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
