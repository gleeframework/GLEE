"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses value with each passing round, I'll try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try 55/45, considering the inflation, I think it's more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that slightly favors me, taking into account the fact that the money loses more value for me than for Alice with each passing round. I'm hoping she'll consider it a fair compromise. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder than me, Bob. I'll take a bit more this round. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the inflation is indeed affecting me more, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Alice's offer is less favorable to me than the original 60/40 split, so I'll try to push for a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I think 58/42 is a fair adjustment. Let's settle on this before the money loses even more value.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to make an offer that's slightly more aggressive than my previous one, taking into account the fact that the money is losing value rapidly for me. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in settling on this split before the inflation worsens. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting us nowhere Bob. I'm willing to be a bit more generous this time, but you need to meet me halfway soon. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although Alice is trying to appear more generous, the offer is still less favorable to me than the original 60/40 split, and the inflation is really starting to hurt my potential gains. I'll try to push for a better deal, hoping that Alice will realize that we're running out of time and that it's better to settle soon. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is killing me. I need a better deal to make it worthwhile. 60/40 is my final offer. Let's end this before we both lose everything.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to make a bold move and offer a 60/40 split in my favor. Considering the rapid inflation, I believe this is the only way I can come out with a decent amount. I'm hoping Alice will see the urgency of the situation and accept this offer, rather than risking everything by prolonging the negotiations. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hurting you far more than me. I'm holding firm. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Although it's not ideal, the inflation has severely reduced the value of the money, and I'm not likely to get a better deal at this point. Alice's offer is still less favorable to me than the original 60/40 split, but I'd rather take something than risk losing everything by prolonging the negotiations further. It's time to cut my losses and accept the offer."
