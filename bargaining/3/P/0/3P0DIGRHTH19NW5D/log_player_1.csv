"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving the door open for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $47.50. Bob's gain of $50 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $45.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I was hoping for a better deal, but Bob's offer is quite reasonable. However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $45. I'll aim to increase my share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight edge.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I still think I can do better. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain of $55 in Round 3 is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $47.25.
Bob's gain of $45 in Round 3 is now worth 73.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $33.15.

Considering the new offer, my gain of $48 is worth 48% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $48.
Bob's gain of $52 is worth 52% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $52.

I think this offer is quite close to my previous offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll decide to accept this offer.
