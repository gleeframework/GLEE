"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $9,000 in the first round is now worth $8,100 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to divide $5,000, which is worth $4,500 in this round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll give it a shot. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
