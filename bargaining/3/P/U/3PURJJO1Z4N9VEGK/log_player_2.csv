Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice, I'll propose a division that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Alice's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a higher share. However, Alice's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk rejecting it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
