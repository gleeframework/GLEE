"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's only the first round, and I'm not going to settle for less than half. The inflation penalty isn't that significant yet, and I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next rounds. Besides, I want to see how Alice reacts to a rejection. Let's see what she comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, fair and square. No need to overcomplicate things!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a 50/50 split, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. I'm willing to be slightly flexible, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice has increased her offer by a mere $50, which isn't enough to sway me. The inflation penalty is still relatively low, and I'm willing to take the risk to see if I can get a better deal. I want to push Alice to make a more significant concession. Let's see what she comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5050, ""alice_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a bit more than half to account for the growing inflation penalty. Let's meet in the middle... of the middle!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! Let's be reasonable. This offer gives you slightly more than the last one, acknowledging the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice has increased her offer by another $50, but it's still not enough to make up for the growing inflation penalty. I've lost over 18% of the value already, and I need a more substantial concession to make it worthwhile. I'll keep pushing to see if Alice is willing to make a more significant compromise. The pressure is on, but I'm not ready to give in yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is taking its toll. I need a bit more to make up for the lost value. This is my most generous offer yet. Take it, or we risk losing everything!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm holding firm.  The inflation is significant, and we both need to be realistic.  This is a fair offer, given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nThe inflation penalty is becoming too significant to ignore, and I've lost over 26% of the value already. Alice's offer is still not ideal, but it's the best one I've received so far. Considering the time pressure and the risk of losing everything, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's better to get something than nothing, and I don't think I can negotiate a better deal at this point. Time to cut my losses and walk away with what I can get."
