"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We can both benefit from getting something now, before the inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'm not sure I want to accept a 50-50 split, especially when I could potentially negotiate for more. But Bob's message is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed gain due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer, but I'll keep an eye on Bob for future rounds.
