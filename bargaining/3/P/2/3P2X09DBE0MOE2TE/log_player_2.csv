"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Since I don't know how inflation impacts Alice, I'm better off rejecting this offer and forcing her to make a proposal where she has to consider the decreasing value of the money.  This gives me more negotiating power in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We can both benefit from getting something now, before the inflation hits too hard.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While I'm not sure how inflation impacts Alice, I know it impacts me.  An even split is the safest option in this round to avoid losing too much due to the decreasing value of money.
* **Future Negotiation:**  This offer establishes a starting point for further negotiation.  If Alice rejects, I'll have a better understanding of her priorities in the next round."
