Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. An even split won't work because of the inflation. I need a little extra to make it fair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, time is running out. While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than continuing to haggle and risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the next 7 rounds.  The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the split becomes for me due to the difference in inflation rates."
