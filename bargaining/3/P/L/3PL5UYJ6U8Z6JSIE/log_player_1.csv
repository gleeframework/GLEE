"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair share, and I'll take $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $32. Bob's gain of $60 is also worth 80% of the original amount, which is $48.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'll accept this offer.
