"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 20, I'll take 80. Simple and fair.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent chunk to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50-50 is a good starting point.  We can adjust from there if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now getting $72 (80 x 0.9).

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. The 50-50 split is a fair starting point, and we can always adjust from here.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
