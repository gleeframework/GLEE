"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future if you refuse. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $1000, the inflation will make the offer less appealing in the future.  Bob has a better chance of getting a larger share by rejecting and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in our favor, which is still more than you offered me last round. Accept, and we both get something, or risk losing more with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My offer is still generous, considering you lost 10% of your value from last round.  Accept this and we both get something, or risk losing more with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $2000, the inflation will make the offer less appealing in the future.  Bob has a better chance of getting a larger share by rejecting and proposing in the next round. The loss from inflation will make the next round's value slightly less, but Bob can still make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle this time.  We've both lost value due to inflation, so it's time to compromise. Accept, and we both get a fair share.  Reject, and we risk getting nothing at all.""}
