This is a tough one!  Here's why I'm finally accepting:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is plummeting for me. Waiting any longer means getting even less. 
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** She's consistently offered deals favoring herself and seems to be playing a waiting game.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While 43 isn't ideal, it's better than risking another round and potentially getting a worse offer or nothing at all."
