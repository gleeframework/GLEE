"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm the one who's patient! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now considering the value of the money. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a smaller share than in the initial proposal, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to me. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a smaller amount for Bob, but still a significant portion.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, Alice! I'm willing to make a serious offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money!

Considering the value of the money, I'll calculate the actual amount Bob is offering me in Round 4:

Alice gain: 300,000
Actual value of Alice gain (compared to Round 1): 300,000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 412,795.31

It seems like Bob is offering me a smaller share than in the previous rounds, but still a significant portion. However, considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 70/30 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to be even more favorable to me. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose an even smaller amount for Bob.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up much more, Bob. This is my final offer!""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not taking this seriously, Alice. I'll take the majority and leave you with a small fraction! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money!

Considering the value of the money, I'll calculate the actual amount Bob is offering me in Round 6:

Alice gain: 100,000
Actual value of Alice gain (compared to Round 1): 100,000 / 0.596 (1 - 0.404) = 167,966.67

It seems like Bob is offering me a very small share, and considering the inflation effect, it's not even a fraction of what I could have gotten earlier. I'm not going to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 6 was 90/10 in his favor, I'll try to make a final offer that's more aggressive. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a very small amount for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll take almost everything, and leave you with a tiny fraction! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging the value of the money!

Considering the value of the money, I'll calculate the actual amount Bob is offering me in Round 8:

Alice gain: 50,000
Actual value of Alice gain (compared to Round 1): 50,000 / 0.474 (1 - 0.526) = 105,856.94

It seems like Bob is offering me an incredibly small share, and considering the inflation effect, it's almost nothing. I'm not going to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to squeeze me out of the deal. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer, but I'm not willing to accept this one."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 8 was 95/5 in his favor, I'll try to make a final offer that's extremely aggressive. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose an almost negligible amount for Bob.

  ""alice_gain"": 999000,

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take it all. It's mine now! 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob has decided to take the entire amount. I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
