"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob.  I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. It's better to secure something now than risk losing it all later due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to play strategically. Even though Alice's offer is ""fair"", I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll risk the inflation for now and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor this time. This offer still gives you a decent share, and it's much better than what we'd get if we keep delaying and inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. While I'd still prefer a larger share, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation.  A 45/55 split is still a decent gain, and it's better than risking nothing at all."
