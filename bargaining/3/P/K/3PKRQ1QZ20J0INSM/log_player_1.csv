Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
