"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I'm not going to give you all the money! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, since the money will be worth less for Bob each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm going to take a bit more this time. You'll get 4000, which is better than nothing! Let's end this before the money loses even more value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a firmer stance. You're getting a smaller share, but it's still a better deal than walking away with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The money I gain is worth less each round, and it's possible that Alice will offer me even less in the next round. It's better to take this offer before the money loses even more value."
