"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are catching up!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting, given the diminishing returns.
