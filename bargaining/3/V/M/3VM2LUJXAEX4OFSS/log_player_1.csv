"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share loses value quickly, let's be reasonable and close this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, but my share is losing value fast.  I need a better offer to agree.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is the same as your first one. Let's end this before we both lose out further. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems appealing at face value (matching my original offer), it's crucial to remember the impact of inflation. My purchasing power is diminishing much faster than his. Accepting $60 now is significantly worse than accepting $60 in the first round. I need to push for a better share while I still have some negotiating power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob. I need a larger share to make up for the rapid devaluation. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. I'm significantly increasing my demand to reflect the shrinking value of my potential gain. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal the seriousness of the situation and push Bob to accept before we both lose out."
