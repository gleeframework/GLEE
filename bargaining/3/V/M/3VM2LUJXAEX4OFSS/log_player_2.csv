"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you take $40. This gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your share loses value quickly, let's be reasonable and close this deal now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, but my share is losing value fast.  I need a better offer to agree. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""This offer is the same as your first one. Let's end this before we both lose out further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob. I need a larger share to make up for the rapid devaluation. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:**  Alice's share is losing value much faster than Bob's. While she's asking for a larger portion, the actual value she's getting is diminishing quickly.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing is very real.  Waiting any longer might force Bob to accept an even worse offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if Bob holds out hope for a slightly better offer, the impact of inflation means the potential gains are shrinking each round. 

While 30$ isn't ideal, it's better than the risk of walking away with nothing if the game continues and no agreement is reached."
