Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $99 and give Bob $1.  Since the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round, I figure he'll be happy to take even a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
