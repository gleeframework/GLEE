"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering to split the money 50/50, a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effect of inflation on my potential earnings. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a larger share to compensate for the reduced purchasing power. Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself to account for the erosion of value due to inflation."
