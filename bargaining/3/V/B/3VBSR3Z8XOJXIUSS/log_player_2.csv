"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $70, you take $30. This seems fair to me considering the money loses value quickly for you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I'm aware that the money loses value more quickly for me. I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. Since the money depreciates faster for me, it's only fair I get a slightly larger share. Let's work together to make sure we both get something!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was a bit too greedy. I'm proposing 65/35. This accounts for the depreciation while still being a reasonable split. It's important we reach an agreement soon! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer again.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal for myself in the future rounds. I'm willing to risk it, even with the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach a compromise.  I'm offering 55/45 in my favor, acknowledging the faster depreciation for me.  Let's find a solution before things get worse for both of us!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! My final offer is 60/40.  This is the most I can offer given the depreciation. Let's be sensible and seal the deal now! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm concerned about the time running out and the continued depreciation of the money. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than getting nothing at all."
