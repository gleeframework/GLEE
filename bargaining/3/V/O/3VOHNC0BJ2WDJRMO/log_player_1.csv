I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will benefit Bob more than me in later rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need to get a fair share.  This offer reflects the inflation we've both experienced."

Even though the offer is not great, the inflation is really hurting my gains.  Accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
