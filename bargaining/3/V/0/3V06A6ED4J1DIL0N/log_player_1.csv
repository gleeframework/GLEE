"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'd rather not accept a lower share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
