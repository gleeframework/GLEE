"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000.

I'm not sure I like the fact that Bob's gain is $600,000, which is 120% of what it was in the first round. That seems like a pretty big increase!

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still trying to get a decent share for myself."

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $300,000 is worth 30.1% of the original $1,000,000, which is $300,000.

Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 70% of the original $1,000,000, which is $700,000.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share than me. I'll reject it.
