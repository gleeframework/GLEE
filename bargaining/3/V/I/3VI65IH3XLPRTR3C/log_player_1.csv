```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give away all the money on the first round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and sending it back to Bob. I'm not ready to settle for a 60-40 split just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll take this deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $630,000 and Bob gets $370,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I still want a bit more. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think I'm getting a bit desperate, and I don't want to risk going into another round. I'll take this deal and call it a day.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for him. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than going into another round with even lower-value money!"
