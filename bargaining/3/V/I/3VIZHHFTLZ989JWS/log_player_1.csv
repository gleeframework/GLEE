"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Fair share, let's be friends""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering I'm the one making the first move. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5040,
  ""bob_gain"": 4960,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, last chance""
}

I'm taking into account the 20% inflation from the previous rounds, so the actual value is lower. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, hoping he'll accept this offer. The message is a mix of compromise and a hint of urgency. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
