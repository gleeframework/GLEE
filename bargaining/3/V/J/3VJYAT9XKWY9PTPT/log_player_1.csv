I'm going for a big chunk of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept that! While the money is worth less, I'm still in a stronger position to get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what Bob offers then."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's potential resistance.  Let's see if this is more appealing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer.  Even though the inflation has hit hard, I can still do better. Let's see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to keep the pressure on Bob. This offer is still favorable to me, considering the inflation, but it's also more reasonable than my last one.  Hopefully, he'll see it's in his best interest to accept."
