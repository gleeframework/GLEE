"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it to avoid the game going on for too long!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'm not sure if this offer is as generous as it seems. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was for a 70/30 split, I'll try to get an even better deal. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money Bob gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, this offer is actually a 40/60 split in terms of the original $1,000,000. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I'll accept this offer.
