Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, Alice's offer is the best I've been presented with so far. It's better to take a somewhat less favorable split than to risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
