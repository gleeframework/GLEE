"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer to get some certainty and a fair share of the remaining money.
