Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want the bigger share, but 60/40 in your favor is too much.  How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? It's still a win-win and avoids us losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
