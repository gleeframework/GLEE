"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not happy with the 60-40 split, especially since the money is already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money losing value, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer. At this point, I'd rather take what I can get than risk waiting for a better deal that might not come."
