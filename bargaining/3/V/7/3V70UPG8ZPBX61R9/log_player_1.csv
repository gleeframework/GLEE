Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant decrease in value for you and the pressure to settle, I've adjusted my offer. This is still more generous than waiting further rounds, where your share would drastically decrease. It's in both our interests to settle now, but I'm not willing to compromise much further given the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 580000

This is a tough one, but I still need to reject. While the pressure is on, accepting now sets a precedent that Bob can keep inching closer to his desired outcome. I need to show I'm willing to walk away, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
