"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine, but in reverse.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not going to accept an offer that's essentially the same as the one I made in the first round. I'll try to do better next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}

I'm offering Bob 460,000$ and keeping 540,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his original offer. Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 73.1% of its original value. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. At least I'll get 460,000$ out of this deal, which is better than nothing."
