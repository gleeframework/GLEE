"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this simple. I propose I take $60 and you get $40. It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```tool_code
Reason:While Alice's offer seems appealing at first, it's important to remember the inflation factor. As rounds progress, the value of the money decreases for Alice faster than for me. It's strategically advantageous to wait for a better offer in a later round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, considering the inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor this time.  Let's close the deal and avoid further devaluation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Your offer doesn't account for the inflation we're both facing. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a compromise, and it's better to settle now before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

```tool_code
Reason: While not ideal, Alice's offer in round 3 is becoming increasingly reasonable due to the inflation heavily impacting her potential gains. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking further devaluation and potentially ending up with a worse deal in later rounds.
