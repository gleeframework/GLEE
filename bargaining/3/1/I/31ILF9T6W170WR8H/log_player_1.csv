"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60-40, which seems like a reasonable and fair split to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $20 is actually worth less than $25 in the first round. I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm willing to accept it to get something. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
