"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial 100$ and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game."
