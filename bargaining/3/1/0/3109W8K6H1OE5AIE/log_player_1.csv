"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he's willing to accept a fair split early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll reject this offer, as I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 60% of the money so easily.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up much more.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up much, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to his desired share.

I'll reject this offer as well, since I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 55% of the money, I'll try to get more.""
}
```

I'm trying to hold my ground and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I'm not sure how long we can keep this up.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground and split the money evenly, but I'm aware that the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
