"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work towards a more even split later if you're willing to play along. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's risky to accept a deal where you get so little, especially considering the inflation factor. It's better to see what Alice proposes in the next round after the value of the money decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
