"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a fair and straightforward offer, and it gets us out of the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want the majority share! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up the majority share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
