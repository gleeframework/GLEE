"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's start with that and see if we can reach a good agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
