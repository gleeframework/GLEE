# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  Given the inflation, accepting now benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet. With the inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more favorable split.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer and it's my turn again!"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Countering with a slight adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken Bob's previous offer into consideration and decided to make a counteroffer. Given the inflation, I've adjusted the split to 55-45 in my favor.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time with inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think accepting the 50/50 split is the best decision at this point. Further negotiations would likely lead to even greater losses due to inflation, and Bob's offer seems reasonable. Let's conclude the game with this fair split.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've accepted his offer!"
