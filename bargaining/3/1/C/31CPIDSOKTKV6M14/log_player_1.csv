"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a good chunk, but I want to keep most of it!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the money, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original amount, so I'll get 72% of the original 300,000, which is 216,000.

I'll reject this offer since it's not a good deal for me. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 64% of the original amount due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end this game!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the money, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of the original amount, so I'll get 51.2% of the original 500,000, which is 256,000.

I'll accept this offer since it's a 50/50 split, and it's a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.
