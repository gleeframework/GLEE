"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take a small slice of the pie, but don't worry, there's more to come in later rounds.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a better deal than 45%. Let's split it 60/40 this time. We're both losing money with each round, so let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting 40% when the total amount is decreasing significantly with each round is not in Bob's best interest.  There's still time to negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split.  It's more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation.  Let's be realistic and seal the deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm getting closer to your offer, but still need to get a bit more. Let's split it 55/45, and we can finally finish this game. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 45% share at this stage is better than risking a worse offer or running out of rounds and getting nothing. The effects of inflation are becoming significant, and it's unlikely Alice will agree to anything much better given her previous rejections."
