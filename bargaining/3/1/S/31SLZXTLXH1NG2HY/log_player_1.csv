I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair for the first round."

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'll wait for the next round and try to make a better offer."

# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money! With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

}
```
It's better to accept this offer than to risk losing even more value in the next round."
