Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,

Round 2

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation affecting my share. However, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
