"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $360,000, which is a significant decrease.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'll have to decide whether the extra $120,000 for Bob is worth it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. I'll aim to get a larger share of the money, considering the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to my desired share, but still leave you with a decent amount! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether $350,000 is a good deal for me now. With the inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means it's actually worth around $363,636.

While I'd prefer a better deal, I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse offer. Bob's offer is not great, but it's still a decent amount.
