"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

For Bob's offer, if we assume the initial $100 is now worth 90% of its original value, then the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

Since we're now at a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer.
