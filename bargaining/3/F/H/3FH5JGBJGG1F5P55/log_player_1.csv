I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering the inflation, and it should be in Bob's best interest to accept. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, even considering the inflation. While his offer is worth 5% less than in the previous round, it only gives me $50,000. This is a huge drop from my initial proposal of $900,000. I will reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. This takes into account the inflation, but still gives Bob a significantly larger share than the previous round.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair.  Even with the inflation, I'm only getting $150,000.  My offer in the previous round gave him twice that amount.  I'm going to reject this and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a much fairer deal than Bob's last offer, and still takes into account the inflation that's been happening. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept anything less than this."
