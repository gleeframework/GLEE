"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... Since Bob's offer is a very lopsided split in his favor, I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better next time.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards his favor, but it's not as extreme as before.

I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
