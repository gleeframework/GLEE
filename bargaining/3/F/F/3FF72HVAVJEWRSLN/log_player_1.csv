Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I believe in fairness, Alice. Let's split it evenly.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want an even split, Bob, but time is ticking and the value is decreasing. This offer still gives you a good share.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice, but so is fairness.  This offer is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of the situation. He knows the value decreases for him, so he's trying to secure a little more each round.  While his offer is close to even, it's still tilted in his favor and I believe I can get a better deal as time pressures him more."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time.  This is a fair offer considering the decreasing value. Let's close the deal and both benefit.""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now. This offer gives us both a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this is the best offer I'm likely to get from Bob. The inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains, making him more agreeable to a less favorable split. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount before the value diminishes further and risks getting nothing in the later rounds."
