Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep it simple and split the money equally. 50/50 seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'll offer you 4200, which is a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's close this out.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is working against you. This is my final offer, let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While it's less than my original offer, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the best option at this point. The inflation is eating into my potential gains, and waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome."
