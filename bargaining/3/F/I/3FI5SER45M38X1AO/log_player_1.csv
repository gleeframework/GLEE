Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer is more than fair considering the inflation.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, Bob is heavily leveraging the rapid depreciation of his own share.  He knows his position gets significantly worse with each round. My losses are far less severe.  By rejecting this offer, I force him to make a move in a situation where his bargaining power is rapidly diminishing."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away even more of your potential gain.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Time Pressure:**  Bob is feeling the squeeze of inflation more than I am. My last rejection likely made him nervous. Now is the time to push for a slightly better deal than his last offer.
* **Appearing Firm:** By stating this is my final offer, I signal I'm unwilling to negotiate further. This can push Bob to accept, especially if he fears I'll offer even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Balancing Greed and Risk:** Holding out longer *might* get me a marginally better deal, but it also increases the risk that Bob calls my bluff.  This offer is a good balance between maximizing my gain and securing a deal."
