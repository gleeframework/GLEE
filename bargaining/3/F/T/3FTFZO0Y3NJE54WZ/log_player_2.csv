# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is working heavily in my favor. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This is it - last chance. Take it or I'm walking.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice.  The inflation is making her offers worse with every round, and she's running out of time. This offer is heavily in my favor, but given the circumstances and the limited rounds remaining, it's a risk worth taking."
