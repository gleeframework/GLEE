"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 70, you get 30. Fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
