"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives me a slight advantage since I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I think it's unfair that I'm only getting 20% of the remaining 100$, while Bob is taking the majority with 80%. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I need a decent share too""}

I'm proposing that Bob gets 70% of the remaining 100$, which is a significant portion, but I'm also taking 30% for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a decent share for him, and I'm giving him the majority."
