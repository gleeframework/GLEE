"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's much too low for me, and there are plenty of rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to propose a near-even split, giving me $9,000 and Alice $1,000. While I'm not greedy, I want to maximize my gains in this first round, as the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still much too low, and the inflation is starting to bite. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

I'll try to be more reasonable this time, but I still want to secure the majority of the money. I'm offering $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2710 
# Alice gain: 7290 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the offer is higher than the previous round, the inflation is becoming increasingly painful.  I need to hold out for a deal where I get a larger share.  The risk of getting nothing is becoming real, but I'm still hoping for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly larger share this time, hoping to entice her into accepting.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds and the accelerating inflation, but I'm still aiming for a good share of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Bob gain: 3439 
# Alice gain: 6561 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

The inflation is becoming increasingly serious, but Alice's offer is still too low. I need to hold out for a better deal, even though the risk of getting nothing is growing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice a larger share this time, hoping to entice her into accepting. The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure some money before it's too late."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4096 
# Alice gain: 5904 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. The inflation is getting out of control, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small amount. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the remaining rounds, or at least get a larger share before the money is completely worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

The pressure is really mounting now.  I'm going to offer a straight 50/50 split. The inflation has hit hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This feels like the most likely way to secure at least some money."
