"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Inflation is a double-edged sword. Let's be reasonable: I get 65%, you get 35%.  Think carefully, in the next round this deal will be much worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
