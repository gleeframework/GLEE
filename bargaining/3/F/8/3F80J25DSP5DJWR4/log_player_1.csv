"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This feels like a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I still believe I have a stronger negotiating position. The inflation is hurting Bob more than it is hurting me. I will reject this offer and propose a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money, but recognizing the inflation impact on Bob, I'm reducing my demand slightly. This offer gives me a comfortable amount, while leaving Bob with a reasonable share to hopefully incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, and his offer is becoming increasingly appealing. While I'd still prefer a larger share, accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point."
