Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to split the money evenly, but I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me less than half. This inflation is making things difficult, so let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
