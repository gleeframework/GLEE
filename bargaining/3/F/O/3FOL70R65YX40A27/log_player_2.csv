"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, but I'm expecting a bigger share as the rounds go by. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is extremely disadvantageous to me. While she acknowledges a larger share later, the immediate difference is too significant. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such a skewed starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I understand the time pressure is on you more, but I need a reasonable cut too. This offer is fair considering the depreciation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to offset the increasing inflation. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough.  While she acknowledges the inflation, she's not factoring in her losses adequately. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this soon.  I'm offering a significant portion, but you need to recognize the depreciation is impacting you far more than me. Let's be reasonable.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to the deadline.  Let's split the money evenly and avoid losing everything. It's the best chance for both of us to get something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. We're getting too close to the deadline. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal considering the initial depreciation rates, getting nothing is a worse outcome."
