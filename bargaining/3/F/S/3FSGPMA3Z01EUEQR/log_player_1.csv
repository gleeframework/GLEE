"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 20% share, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, but this time I'm taking a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as thrilled about Bob's offer. However, it's still a decent split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 45% share, which is a bit more generous than his previous offer. Hopefully, he'll accept this one!"
