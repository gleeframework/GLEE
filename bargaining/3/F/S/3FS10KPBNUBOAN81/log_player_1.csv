"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 70/30 split is a fair starting point, given the inflation dynamic.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $3000 is actually worth $2400 in real value.

I'm not thrilled with the 70-30 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think about making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
