"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm showing my willingness to compromise. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was generous, but I'm looking for a better split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation effect.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to aim for a better split. However, Bob's offer is still a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer a better split. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a better split, let's get closer to an equal share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! With the money worth 14.26% less, I need to adjust my strategy.

Considering Bob's offer, I notice he's trying to get closer to an equal share, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give him the majority of the money. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a slightly better split than my previous one, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
