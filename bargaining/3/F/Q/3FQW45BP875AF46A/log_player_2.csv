Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 57

```

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation rate is severely impacting Bob's potential gains.  Waiting any longer means the offer, even if slightly better, will be worth significantly less due to the 20% per round decrease.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows time is on her side. She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this, especially as Bob's position weakens with each round.

While getting 43% of the initial amount isn't great, it's better than risking another rejection and ending up with an even smaller portion in a later round, or worse, nothing at all if the game continues indefinitely."
