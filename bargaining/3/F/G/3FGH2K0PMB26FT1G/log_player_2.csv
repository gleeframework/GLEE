"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know the money devalues faster for you, so I propose a slight advantage for me in the first round. This way, we both benefit from a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money devalues by 5% each round for me, and I'm offered less than half, I'll take the chance to propose a different split in the next round, hoping for a better deal before the money devalues further.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round where I'll make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the 5% devaluation for me each round, I believe a larger share is fair to compensate for the loss. Let's settle this quickly to minimize losses.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll see the logic in compensating for the devaluation and accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  Another round means more losses for both of us. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to settle this fairly before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money devalues by 5% each round for me, and we've already gone through two rounds (resulting in a 9.75% devaluation), accepting a 50/50 split at this point seems the most reasonable decision. Further rounds would only decrease the value of my share, making this offer the best option under the current circumstances."
