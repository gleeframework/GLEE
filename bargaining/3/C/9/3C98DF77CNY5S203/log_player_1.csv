"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $5000 is actually worth 95% of the original $9000 I proposed in Round 1, which is $8550.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet, especially since I'm getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer.
