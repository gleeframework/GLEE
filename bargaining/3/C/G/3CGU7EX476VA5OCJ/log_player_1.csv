"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me even less than the original split. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking into account the 20% inflation and trying to get a better deal for myself."
