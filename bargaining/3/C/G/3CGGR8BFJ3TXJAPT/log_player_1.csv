This is a tough one, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My potential gains are plummeting rapidly. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller share, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split in later rounds.
* **Bob's offer:** While not ideal, Bob is acknowledging the inflation disparity and offering slightly more than his previous offer. This suggests he's becoming more willing to compromise.
* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
