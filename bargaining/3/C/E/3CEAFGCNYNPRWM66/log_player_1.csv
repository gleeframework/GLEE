  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this split, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me getting 42% of the remaining $800,000 (due to the 20% decrease in value). Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I can gain! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less, I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'd like to try to get a fairer share.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I can gain! With the money I gain being worth 67.23% less, I'll have to be extremely careful not to get too greedy.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'd like to try to get a fairer share.

However, I'm running out of time and the value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to make a decision quickly.

However, I'm starting to get concerned that I might not have enough time to get a good deal, given the rapid decrease in the value of the money I gain.
