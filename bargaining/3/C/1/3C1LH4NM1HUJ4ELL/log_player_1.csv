"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a good deal, but you might want to think twice.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. The message is to entice Bob to consider my offer and maybe not think too much about it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better deal. This offer is a step in the right direction, but I'm hoping for something more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, the money is now worth less, and I need to think carefully about this new offer.

I'll consider the offer and decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a good deal. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $630,000 and Bob gets $370,000. The message is to convey that I'm still trying to get a good deal, but I'm willing to meet Bob halfway."
