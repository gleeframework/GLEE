"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair and generous split.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is tempting, the inflation rate is heavily in Bob's favor. Alice is clearly very impatient. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split considering the time pressure. Let's be reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but this is still a bad deal for Bob. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation favors Bob.  Let's hold strong and see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally time to accept. 

While not ideal, getting an even split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if Alice gets desperate enough to let the game run out."
