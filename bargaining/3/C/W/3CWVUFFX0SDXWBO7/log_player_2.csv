"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'm taking the majority, but I'm giving you something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! The inflation will hurt Alice more than me in the long run. I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This split reflects the impact inflation will have on you. Take it while it's still a good deal.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise a bit more, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's avoid going back and forth further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough considering the inflation is working in my favor.  I need to push for a more significant share before she gets too desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and each round makes this deal worse for you.  I'm offering a very reasonable split considering the circumstances. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We are both losing value with each round.  Let's split this evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While not ideal, splitting it evenly is the most logical choice at this point. The longer we wait, the less we both gain, and an even split ensures we both get a reasonable amount."
