"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to take a big chunk of the money, but I'm offering Bob something to make sure he doesn't immediately reject the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but still keeping a larger share for myself. Hopefully, this will be enough to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer isn't great, inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  Accepting is the best way to ensure I get something at this point."
