Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and we both lose if this drags on.  This offer is reasonable and still favors you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
