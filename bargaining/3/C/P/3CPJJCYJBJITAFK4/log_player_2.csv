"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth seeing if Alice will make a better offer in the next round, especially since there's no guarantee of how inflation will impact her share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous offer, but it's still less than my initial proposal. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept.  The inflation effect is starting to become a factor, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposals."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now an even split, which is a fair outcome considering the impact of inflation on her potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing if we continue."
