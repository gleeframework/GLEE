"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose that Alice gets $90 and Bob gets $10. This seems like a fair starting point, as Alice gets the majority of the money while Bob still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation hurts him further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse each round due to inflation. While I'm not getting the majority I was hoping for, I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar offer to the last round, hoping to show Bob that I'm not budging too much. This way, I'm hoping he will accept before the inflation hurts him even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting more favorable for him, the inflation is starting to hit hard for him. I'm not getting the perfect split, but this is better than nothing at this point."
