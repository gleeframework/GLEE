"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a fairer share for me considering the initial offer was already skewed towards you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hitting us both, so it's time to be reasonable.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 30. You should be willing to compromise and give me a larger share to make up for the initial offer being skewed towards you. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While Bob's offer isn't great, accepting it is the best choice. My gains are severely impacted by inflation, and rejecting again risks getting an even worse offer in the next round."
