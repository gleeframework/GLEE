**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on my end. While the offers are getting closer to a more even split, I still believe I can get a better deal in the next few rounds.  Alice's losses are becoming more significant with each round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time to be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the only logical choice now.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on now.  Offering a 50/50 split emphasizes fairness and puts the ball squarely in Alice's court.  She's losing money at a faster rate, so she needs to seriously consider if she can get a better deal before we both lose out entirely."
