"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make this quick. Time is money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Delay hurts both players, but Alice loses value faster. Bob's offer in round 2 puts more pressure on Alice to accept quickly.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  A 55/45 split seems generous on Bob's part, potentially encouraging Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse offer in future rounds.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need to move quickly, further adding to the time pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal for me considering the time pressure. Let's close this out now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice's offer is getting worse for Bob while getting better for her. This indicates she's likely feeling the pressure of the devaluation and willing to concede more in future rounds.
* **Still Early:**  It's only round 3. While the money is devaluing, there's still room for negotiation before the losses become too significant.
* **Holding Firm:** By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's not desperate and is willing to wait for a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's wrap this up.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** Bob reduces his demand slightly from 5500 to 5200, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable split.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Round 4 is crucial. Alice is feeling the devaluation more acutely now. The message emphasizes closing the deal quickly. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** Framing the offer as ""fair"" given the time pressure might make Alice more receptive."
