I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to get most of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll be tempted to take it, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept his offer. I know the money is worth less now, but I'm willing to gamble and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still try to get a large share.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I need to be more realistic, but I'm hoping he'll see that the money is depreciating quickly and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting pretty bad. I'm taking a big hit on my share, but it's still more than I would get if I rejected and the game continued.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
