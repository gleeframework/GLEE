Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more to avoid further rounds, but I still need to make up for the lost value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100

**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of the situation. While he is acknowledging the inflation, his offer still heavily favors him. We need to push for a more balanced deal.  We are still in early rounds, and rejecting this offer might make Bob consider a fairer split in the next round."
