I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  It's a big risk, but I'm hoping he'll be happy with something rather than nothing.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm not thrilled about the prospect of waiting, I know that if I reject this offer, the money he'll be able to offer me will continue to shrink due to inflation.  It's worth waiting to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  Bob's offer was extremely low, and I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to him.  I think a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get a good deal."
