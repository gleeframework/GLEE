"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to weigh the trade-off.

In this round, I'd prefer to gain more, considering the reduced value of money. I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was 60-40, which means he's trying to take a larger share. I'll counter with a more favorable offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
