# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tricky situation. While I could hold out hope for a better deal, the risk is that Bob might completely give up. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable gain, even with the inflation, and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
