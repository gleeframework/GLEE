# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm holding firm. Take this deal before inflation eats away at your potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting 40% of the rapidly shrinking pot is still not in Bob's best interest.  Alice knows the pressure is on Bob, but there's a chance a better offer can be secured as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. This is a fair split, and we both know the longer this goes on, the less we both get!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Pushing for more than a 50/50 split at this stage is risky. The inflation is hurting Bob significantly more than Alice. While ideally, Bob would secure a slightly larger portion, a 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable payout before the value diminishes further."
