6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000. It's better to secure something than risk it all with inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can do better than the initial split. Considering the risk of inflation, I propose a slightly more balanced division: $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This way, we both secure a decent amount, and it's more equitable.",Bob,2,

5750.0,4250.0,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a balance. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose $5,750 for me and $4,250 for you. It's a slight improvement for me from your offer, while still ensuring you get a fair share before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to the middle, but I think we can do a bit better. Given the decreasing value due to inflation, I'm proposing $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This adjustment reflects the urgency of reaching an agreement while still aiming for a fair split.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're getting closer, but we need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value. I'm willing to meet you exactly in the middle of our last two offers. I get $5,500, and you get $4,500.  Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
