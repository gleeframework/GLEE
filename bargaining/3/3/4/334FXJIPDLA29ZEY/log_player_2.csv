Let's see what Alice offers next!  I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split right away.  There's plenty of rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering Alice a slightly better deal than she gave me, hoping to encourage her to accept it. It's still a significant gain for me, and I'm confident she'll see the value in getting a guaranteed amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  Even though Alice's offer is slightly less than what I proposed in the previous round, the fact that inflation is hurting her more than me makes this a good deal for me. It's a 50/50 split, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future."
