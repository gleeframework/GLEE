```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start with a fair split, Bob!""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, and another 20% less after the second round, it's worth 40% of the original amount. I'll aim for a larger share.

```

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to take advantage of my greed! But I'm not giving up yet.

I'll stick to my guns and wait for a better offer."

Round 5

# Bob's message: You're really trying to squeeze me out, Alice! I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting away with it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze me out as well. I'll think carefully about this offer.

```

}
```

I'll take the offer and accept the 60-40 split. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value."
