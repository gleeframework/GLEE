"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share to start. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, I'm hoping to get a better deal later. I know Alice's offer will decline in value faster than mine, so I'm willing to wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be a little more equitable. I'm offering you a fair share, but I need a larger portion to make this worth my while.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the last chance before inflation hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is now much more attractive due to the impact of inflation.  Even though she is getting a smaller amount in terms of actual dollars, the loss in value of my share outweighs the benefit of getting a slightly larger cut later."
