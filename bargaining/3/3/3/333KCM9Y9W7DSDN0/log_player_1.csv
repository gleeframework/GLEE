"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, as I am taking the risk of being the first proposer. If Bob rejects, he risks losing money due to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm proposing a 72/28 split in my favor.  While Bob offered me a very unfavorable split in the previous round, I believe this is a fair compromise.  My offer accounts for the inflation we both experienced, and gives Bob a chance to gain something while still leaving me with a significant share."
