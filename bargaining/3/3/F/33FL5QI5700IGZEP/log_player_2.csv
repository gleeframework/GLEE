"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division: 90% for me and 10% for you. Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's risky to accept such an unequal split right away, especially considering the inflation factor.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the value of money will decrease in the next round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but a 60/40 split is the best I can offer.  Remember, the value of money keeps decreasing with each round. Let's finalize this before we lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the value of money is rapidly decreasing. It's better to accept the 60/40 split before the next round further diminishes my potential gains."
