I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm aware that the money will be worth less for Bob in subsequent rounds. I want to maximize my gain while also ensuring that Bob has a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is the best course of action. The inflation will continue to erode the value of the money with each passing round, and it's likely I won't get a better offer than this."
