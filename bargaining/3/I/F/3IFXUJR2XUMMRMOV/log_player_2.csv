Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value decreases rapidly. Accepting your previous offer in round 4 would leave me with less than what I'm proposing now. Let's settle this - I'll take the slightly larger share this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
