Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'm getting a significantly smaller share (5% vs. 90%), I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The inflation means my potential gains in future rounds will be even smaller, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better deal. It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
