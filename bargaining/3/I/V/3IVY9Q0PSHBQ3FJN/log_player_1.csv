"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which means I'll get $70 and Bob will get $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got generous, now it's your turn to give a little 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation. 

The $60 I'll get is equivalent to 80% of the original $70 I was offered in the first round. So, I'm actually getting a bit less than I initially proposed.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which means I'll get $55 and Bob will get $45."
