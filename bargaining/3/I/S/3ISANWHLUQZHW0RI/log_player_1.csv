"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, considering the value will decrease with each round.  Let's both get a larger share now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
