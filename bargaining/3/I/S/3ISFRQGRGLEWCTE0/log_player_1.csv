"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, and keeping 60% for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to fight 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to negotiate further."

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a better deal""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still not ready to give up much more."

Round 4

# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully...

}
```

I'm willing to compromise and accept Bob's offer. It seems like we're getting close to a deal!"
