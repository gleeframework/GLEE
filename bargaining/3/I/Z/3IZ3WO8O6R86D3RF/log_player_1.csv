"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try 55/45, I'm willing to give you a little more, but I want a bigger share as well. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 0.95 \* 45 = 42.75.

I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject the offer for now and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so my gain is worth 0.95 \* 42.75 = 40.5125.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I think we can meet in the middle. 50/50 seems fair, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair division of the remaining money."
