"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be strategic.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation, the money is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 576000,
  ""bob_gain"": 424000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (1 - 0.488 = 0.512), I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively good deal considering the current value of the money.
