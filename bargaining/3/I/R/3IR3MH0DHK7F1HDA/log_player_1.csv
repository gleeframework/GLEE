"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal, or if he's going to play it more strategically.  This also leaves room for negotiation in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  With inflation, the money will be worth less in the future rounds. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all by rejecting this offer."
