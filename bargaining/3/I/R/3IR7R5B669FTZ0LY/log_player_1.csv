Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a larger share, but still leaves something for Bob. This allows for potential negotiation in the next round while also maximizing my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, this offer is still significantly better than the 1000 I would have received in the next round due to inflation.  It's a good deal for me."
