Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your need for a larger share, but 65/35 is too far.  Let's compromise at 45/55. This is a fair and reasonable split given the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer my 65/35 split, Alice's offer of 55/45 is still acceptable. Here's why:

* **Significant Gain:**  I'm still receiving $550,000, which is a substantial sum.
* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer this goes on, the less Alice's potential offers will be worth to her due to the 10% inflation. This makes her more likely to concede to a larger share for me in future rounds, but there's no guarantee she'll offer something better than this. 

It's a good deal at this point, and it avoids the risk of further devaluation.
