"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided proposal from Bob! I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me only $200,000. I'll reject it.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was so skewed towards his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is even more extreme than the previous one! I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only $100,000. That's way too low.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think I'll try to find a middle ground this time. Here's my offer for Round 5:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since Bob's previous offers have been getting more and more extreme. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think I've had enough of Bob's extreme offers. I'll try to make a very aggressive offer this time, since I think I have the upper hand. Here's my proposal for Round 9:
