"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I think this is a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, given the value of the money decreases for me in each round. Let's make this a quick deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is fair, especially since the value of the money decreases by 20% for him each round, but remains the same for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is closer to my original proposal, but still gives Bob a decent share."
