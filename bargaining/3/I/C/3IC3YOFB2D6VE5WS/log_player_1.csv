"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20$ and keeping 80$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a fair split this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I'd rather try to negotiate for more, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You proposed 50-50, but I'm willing to give you a bit more, let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40$ and keeping 60$ for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this time. Let's see if you'll accept my offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because Bob is now asking for 60$, which is more than he asked for in the previous round, and I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45$ and keeping 55$ for myself, trying to find a new balance."
