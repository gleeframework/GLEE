"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but your offer is still too far off.  Let's split it 65/35 in my favor. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer I wait, the less my share is worth. However, I need to push for a more significant change in the split, otherwise, I risk ending up with a tiny fraction of the money.  It's a risky move, but I need to aim higher to make it worthwhile."
