"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 in this round is equivalent to $320,000 in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is equivalent to $600,000 in the first round.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my initial proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly biased split in my favor this time, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $300,000 in this round is equivalent to $160,000 in the first round.
Bob's gain of $700,000 in this round is equivalent to $700,000 in the first round.

Considering the significant difference in the equivalent values, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more biased split in my favor this time, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $250,000 in this round is equivalent to $120,000 in the first round.
Bob's gain of $750,000 in this round is equivalent to $750,000 in the first round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{

```

I'm reverting back to a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more neutral offer."
