Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means getting a bit less than half."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 39 
# Alice gain: 61 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Alice is clearly willing to run out the clock, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Accepting a 39/61 split now is better than getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
