"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting longer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  Both players lose money due to inflation each round. It's in Bob's best interest to settle quickly as his losses are smaller than Alice's. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** By round 2, Alice knows Bob is unwilling to accept a deal where she gets significantly more. Offering slightly more than a 50/50 split might entice her to accept to avoid further losses from inflation. 
* **Future Rounds:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can make a less generous offer in round 3, knowing the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:**  The money is rapidly losing value. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller amount for both players, even if Bob gets a larger share.
* **Acceptable Offer:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is not drastically unfair. Accepting ensures Bob receives a reasonable sum rather than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a much better offer in future rounds is risky.  The longer the game goes on, the less the potential gain outweighs the losses from inflation."
