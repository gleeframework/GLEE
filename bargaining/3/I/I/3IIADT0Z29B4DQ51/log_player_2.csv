"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's fair! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially with inflation coming into play.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll take a bigger one, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. My potential gain is reduced by 36% due to inflation, making a larger share less attractive than in the previous round.  It's also important to consider that Alice may not be willing to offer more in the future, and the money might become worth even less."
