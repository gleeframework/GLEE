Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I have some leverage to negotiate. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to concede a little bit to avoid further rounds of negotiation. Let's split it this way.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth 19% less for Alice now, she has more incentive to settle. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get an even better offer. The difference between our proposed splits is still relatively small, so I'm willing to take the risk and see how Alice reacts in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further to reach an agreement. Let's split the money this way. It's still a better deal for me than your last offer, and we can both get something instead of risking getting nothing in the later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is still not meeting me at a point that I consider fair, given the significant impact of inflation on her share. The fact that she's trying to frame this as a better deal for her than my last offer doesn't change my perspective. I believe I can still negotiate for a better split, especially since the pressure of inflation is on her side. I'll continue to push for a more favorable deal in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate. With each round, we're both losing money. Let's split it this way and finally end this game. It's a better deal for you than the last round, and for me, it's still more than I'd get if we keep going. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's attempt to frame it as a better deal for both of us, I believe I can still push for a more favorable split. The pressure of inflation is significantly impacting Alice's share, and I think she will be willing to concede more as the rounds continue. Since my share remains unaffected by inflation, I have the upper hand in negotiations. I'll continue to aim for a higher share in the next round, hoping that Alice will finally accept my offer to avoid further losses."
