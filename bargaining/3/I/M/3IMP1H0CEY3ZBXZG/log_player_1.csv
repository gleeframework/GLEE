"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money equally, with each of us receiving $5000. This ensures fairness and prevents any potential inflation concerns. 
# Alice gain: 5238.095238095238 
# Bob gain: 4761.904761904762 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
