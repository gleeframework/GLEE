"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50. Let's start with a 60/40 split, with me taking the larger share. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident we can find a way to both walk away with more than half of the original amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 60% of the remaining amount, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. I'll aim for a slightly better deal this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55 is a bit steep. Can we try 45/55 or even 46/54?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 70/30 split this time. I understand you're looking for a bigger piece of the pie, but we're both losing money with each passing round.  This offer gives us both more than we had in the previous round, and it's a step towards finding a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 70% of the remaining amount, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's better to take a smaller share now or risk waiting for a potentially better offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth only 51.2% of its original value now, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 70% of what's left. Let's try 38/62, and see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
