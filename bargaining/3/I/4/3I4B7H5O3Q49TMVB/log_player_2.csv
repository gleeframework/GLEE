"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. A 52/48 split seems fair considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate means that the money will be worth less for Alice in subsequent rounds. By rejecting, Bob can potentially secure a better deal for himself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable offer considering the inflation we both face. This ensures we both receive a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I see your point.  Let's settle this - 56/44. 
# Bob gain: 5600 
# Alice gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Bob should accept this offer. While he might be able to get a slightly better deal in the future, the risk of losing out on a large amount of money due to inflation is too great. By accepting, Bob ensures a decent gain while minimizing the impact of the decreasing value of the money."
