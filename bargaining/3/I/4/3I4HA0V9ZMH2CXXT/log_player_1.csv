"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me in Round 2, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. However, Bob's offer is a significant increase from my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk going too low.

I'll decide to reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still affecting my share, I'll aim to get a larger portion of the remaining amount. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A better offer this time. Consider it carefully!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share. With my gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

However, Bob's offer is still quite similar to his previous one, and I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings. With my gain being worth 77.44% less than in the first round, I'll need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a decent offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better end of the deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential earnings. With my gain being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

However, Bob's offer is actually a significant increase from his previous ones, and I'm not sure if I can do better. Considering the limited time left, I'll decide to accept this offer.
