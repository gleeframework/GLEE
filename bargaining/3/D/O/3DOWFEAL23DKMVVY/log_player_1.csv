"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent share to get the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's try 55-45, a little closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
