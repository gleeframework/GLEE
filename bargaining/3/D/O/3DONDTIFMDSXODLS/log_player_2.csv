"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  Inflation will only make us both poorer if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm feeling greedy. I want a bigger share! Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm going for a bigger share this time.  Inflation is going to hurt Alice more than me, so I'm taking advantage of that. Let's see if you'll agree to this, Alice.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose even more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting.  Even though I'm losing some of what I thought I could get, the inflation is going to get worse.  At least we both walk away with something."
