"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40 and keep 60.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 70 is a good enough offer, considering the value of the money has decreased. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has decreased the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 80 is the minimum I can accept.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the decreased value, I'm not sure if 75 is a good enough offer. However, I'm also not eager to continue negotiating further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk further decreasing the value of the money."
