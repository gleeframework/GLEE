Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While this offer is slightly better than her last, accepting it would send a message that I'm willing to cave to her pressure. There's still time, and I need to show her I'm serious about a fairer deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the time pressure. Let's be smart and end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming critical. While not ideal, I need to make a concession to avoid walking away with nothing. This offer is a compromise that still favors Alice but leaves me with a more acceptable amount than her previous offer. By presenting it as my ""final offer,"" I am increasing the pressure on her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I know you'll take this 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 3 rounds left, meaning my leverage is almost gone.
* **Inflation:** Accepting this round means I get 450,000, which is worth significantly less than it was originally.
* **Alice's Behavior:** She's been consistently greedy, betting I'll crack under pressure.

While accepting is the ""safe"" choice, it rewards her bad behavior. There's a chance she's bluffing, knowing I'm desperate.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a high-stakes gamble. I'm rejecting to signal I'm serious about a more equitable split.  If she's bluffing, she might offer something better in the next round. If not, we both lose. It's risky, but the potential reward of a better deal outweighs accepting a bad deal at this point."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""This is my absolute final offer. Take it and we both win. Reject it, and we both get zero. Don't let greed ruin us both.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's the final stretch, and I need to balance risk and potential reward. I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to signal a willingness to compromise, but I'm also drawing a hard line. By framing it as a ""take it or leave it"" situation, I'm putting the pressure back on Alice.  We're both on the brink, and this offer is our last chance to avoid a mutually destructive outcome."
