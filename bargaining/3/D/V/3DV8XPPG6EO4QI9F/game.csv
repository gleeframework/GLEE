6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a simple split. I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think this is a more fair split. You'll still get a significant amount, but I'll get a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value on your end.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. This offer still gives you a good amount while acknowledging the decreasing value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I think this split is more reasonable. You should still take it before the value drops further for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and end this.  Any more rounds and the inflation will eat away at any potential gains for me.",Alice,5,
