"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation affecting Alice's valuation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more fair split. You'll still get a significant amount, but I'll get a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value on your end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. This offer still gives you a good amount while acknowledging the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Since the inflation continues to decrease the value for Alice, I believe I can still push for a better deal in the next round. Let's see what Alice does next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I think this split is more reasonable. You should still take it before the value drops further for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and end this.  Any more rounds and the inflation will eat away at any potential gains for me. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's valuation, I believe an even split at this point is a reasonable compromise. Continuing further might lead to more loss for Alice, making the deal less appealing for her, and I've managed to get to a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome."
