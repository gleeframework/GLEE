"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and we can both benefit from the money now.  No need to worry about inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
