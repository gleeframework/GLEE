Let's see if I can do better!  I'm not sure about ""fairly"" though. ðŸ˜œ"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we should split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share.  Let's be practical, since we both lose money with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still think 60/40 is more favorable, Alice has already rejected my offer and the inflation is making the money worth less.  It's better to accept this and get something rather than risk getting nothing."
