"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 60/40 split is fair *now*, the inflation means that if I reject, I'll be able to make a better offer in the next round. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness of your initial offer, Alice. However, given the inflation, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.  55/45 acknowledges the inflation but keeps things more balanced for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 55/45 split isn't ideal, it's getting closer to my desired outcome.  The inflation is making it increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers, and the next round will see a significant drop in value for my potential gains.  I'll take this offer."
