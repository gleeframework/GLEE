"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and square!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Since the money is worth less now, I'll consider the 20% decrease.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 200,000 and hope that Bob will be more generous in future rounds."
