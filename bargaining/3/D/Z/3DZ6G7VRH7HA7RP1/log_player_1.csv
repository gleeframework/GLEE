"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll take the offer and accept the split:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
