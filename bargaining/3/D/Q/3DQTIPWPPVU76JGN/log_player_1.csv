"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $1000, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me $9,000 and Bob $1,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 4K is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $5,700.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since I'll get $5,700, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
