"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than $45. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and move forward with the game."
