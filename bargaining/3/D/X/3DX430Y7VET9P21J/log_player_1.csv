"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation, so the offer is not as appealing as it seems.

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in my favor, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division of the money."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to give you a good share, but I think I deserve a slightly larger portion 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, and Bob's offer is not as generous as it seems.

```
