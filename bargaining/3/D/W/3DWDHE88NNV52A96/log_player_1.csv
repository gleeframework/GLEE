"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair split and we can both walk away with a good amount of money!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share of the money and can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our earnings."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split the money evenly, it's a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option, especially since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than mine. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain to account for the inflation.""
