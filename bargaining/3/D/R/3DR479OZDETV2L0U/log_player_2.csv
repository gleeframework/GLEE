"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob.  A little more for me since the value decreases faster for me each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about this?  I get a bit more to offset the inflation, but you're still getting a good chunk before it devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice. I'm taking a hit from the inflation, but let's get this done.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing. This is my final offer - it gives me a slight edge considering the inflation, but it's the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. While the deal is getting worse, accepting $4,200 is better than nothing. I'll push for a better deal in the next round, but I need to be prepared to accept a less favorable offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I need to lock in some value before it disappears. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out, and each round makes the potential gains for Bob significantly worse. While Alice is being stubborn, this offer is a last attempt to get her to agree to a deal where Bob gets a slightly better share than her previous offer, but still acknowledges the time pressure and declining value. If Alice rejects this, Bob will likely need to accept a less favorable deal in the next round or risk getting nothing."
