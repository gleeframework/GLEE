"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, with a message suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'll accept Bob's offer.
