"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both be happy with this.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
