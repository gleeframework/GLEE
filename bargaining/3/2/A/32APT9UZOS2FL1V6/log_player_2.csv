"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair split, let's start with a good compromise! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's always good to be greedy in the first round, especially with the inflation risk. We can do better than this!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more considering the initial proposal I made! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting, this offer is still worse than the initial one considering the inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. Inflation is a real concern, and a 50/50 split seems the fairest way to avoid losing too much.""}
```"
