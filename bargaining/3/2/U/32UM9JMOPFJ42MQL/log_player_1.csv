Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I propose to keep $95 and give Bob $5. This is a good starting point as it shows I am willing to be fair, but also want to ensure I get the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to accept, it's significantly less than what I proposed in the first round.  With inflation, I'm losing value, so I'll take my chances with a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to acknowledge the inflation, but still trying to secure a good portion of the money. Hopefully this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't accept a vastly unfair offer."
