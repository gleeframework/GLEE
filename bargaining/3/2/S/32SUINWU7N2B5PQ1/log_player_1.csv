"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 7 to 3""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 3,000$ and keeping 7,000$ for myself. I think this is a fair split, considering the initial amount is 10,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is still fair considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'd rather get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

```

Round 3
