"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 50-50 split. I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, trying to give Bob a slightly better deal than the previous round, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to take the lead 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40-60 split. The inflation has already reduced the value of my potential gain significantly, and I'm not willing to give away more than 40% of the total. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm""}
