"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50-50 split and see how the game goes! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,750.

I'll think for a moment... A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that extra $250.

I'll reject the offer.
