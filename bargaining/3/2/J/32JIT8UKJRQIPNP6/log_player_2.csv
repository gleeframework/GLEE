"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. Take this generous offer and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation isn't too bad, and I think I can get a better deal. Besides, I don't think 100,000 is a ""generous"" offer considering we're splitting 1,000,000! \n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'm ready to make my proposal. \n\n###\n\n(Remember to apply the 5% inflation to my gain in the next round)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm already losing 5%""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll see the sense in meeting halfway, given the circumstances. \n\n###\n\n(Remember, my gain is now 5% less due to inflation, so keep that in mind for future calculations)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, Bob!  Another round wasted means even less for you.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not intimidated by Alice's ""final offer"" claim. Given the current inflation rate, I think I can still get a better deal. I've lost almost 10% of the value already, but I'm willing to risk another round to try and get closer to an equal split. \n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'm ready to make another proposal. \n\n###\n\n(Remember to apply the 9.75% inflation to my gain in the next round)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 495000, ""alice_gain"": 505000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share due to inflation, but I still want a relatively fair split""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I've taken into account the almost 10% loss due to inflation and adjusted my proposal accordingly. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise. \n\n###\n\n(Remember, my gain is now 14.26% less due to inflation, so keep that in mind for future calculations)"
