"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer is a very simple one, giving Alice a large majority of the money. I'm aiming for a quick resolution, hoping Bob will accept the offer, even if it's not a perfectly fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation rate is going to make it increasingly difficult to get a good deal.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a decent share before the money becomes worth significantly less."
