5000.0,5000.0,Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. We can always adjust later if we want.,Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, I'll compromise. Let's do 60/40. I'll still get a good portion, and it's more fair than 90/10. What do you think?",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise. It's closer to 50/50 than your last offer, and it accounts for the inflation we're both experiencing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I think 50/50 is the fairest way to split it now, considering inflation. Let's call it even and move on.",Alice,5,
