"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I'd rather not take a smaller share, but I also don't want to risk losing out on a significant amount of money. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a good one, and I might not get a better deal in future rounds.

I'll accept this offer.
