Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly, each receiving $500000. This ensures fairness and prevents any potential inflation concerns. 
# Alice gain: 500001 
# Bob gain: 499999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
