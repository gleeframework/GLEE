Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This is as low as I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is making concessions, but her offer is still not favorable.  I need to show I'm willing to negotiate but hold firm for a better deal. There's still time, and the inflation factor will continue to work in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree. This offer is a compromise, recognizing the inflation impact but also aiming for a more equitable split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With six rounds gone, we're past the halfway point. The risk of getting nothing is increasing.
* **Concession:** This offer is a slight concession from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Inflation factor:** Alice's share is now worth significantly less, and she's likely to be feeling the pressure.
* **Fairness:** A near-even split, while slightly favoring me, is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances. 

It's a gamble, but I'm hoping the time pressure and the appearance of compromise will persuade Alice to accept."
