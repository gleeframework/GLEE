{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split, as a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm going to offer a 550,000 / 450,000 split.  I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to avoid further rounds of inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to give up some of my potential gain to avoid further rounds of inflation. I believe this is a fair offer considering the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is far from ideal, the inflation rate is making the value of the money decrease rapidly.  It's better to accept and secure a gain, rather than risk losing even more in the next round."
