"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob taking a bigger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer for now.
