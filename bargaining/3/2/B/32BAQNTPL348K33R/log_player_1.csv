"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't always get what you want, let's start with a slight imbalance 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'm not as eager to accept a lower share. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
