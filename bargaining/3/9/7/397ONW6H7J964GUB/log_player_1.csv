"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going to propose a very lopsided deal in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round."
