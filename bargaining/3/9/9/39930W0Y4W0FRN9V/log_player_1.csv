"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll start with a generous offer, hoping to get this over quickly. 900,000 for me, 100,000 for Bob. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I can still do better by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round.  Inflation is working in my favor more than Bob's, so I'm not going to settle for this yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm lowering my share a bit to 850,000, but I'm still giving Bob a substantial amount of 150,000. Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting much less than I initially wanted, Bob's offer is the best I'm going to get at this point. The inflation is really hurting him, and I can't risk another round. 200,000 is better than nothing!"
