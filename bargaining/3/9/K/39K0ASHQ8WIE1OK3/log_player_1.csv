"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount to start with, to see if he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, let's keep negotiating. I think I can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I can compare the offers more easily.

In the first round, my offer was 60-40, and Bob rejected it. Now, Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which is a significant increase in his share. However, considering the inflation effect, the actual amount I gain in this round is equivalent to 95% of the amount I would have gained in the first round (100% - 5% = 95%). So, in terms of the purchasing power, I'm essentially giving up 5% of my potential gain.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was a 50-50 split, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach and offer a smaller share to Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slight increase from the $40 I offered in the first round, but still a smaller share than the 50% he was asking for in the second round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm not there yet. Your turn to get closer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to consider the equivalent value in terms of purchasing power.

In the first round, I offered a 60-40 split, which was rejected. Now, Bob is offering a 55-45 split, which is closer to my original offer, but still slightly more favorable to him.

Considering the inflation effect, the actual amount I gain in this round is equivalent to 85.74% of the amount I would have gained in the first round (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%). So, in terms of purchasing power, I'm essentially giving up 14.26% of my potential gain.

Since Bob's offer is closer to my original proposal, and I'm not sure if I can do better, I'll accept this offer.
