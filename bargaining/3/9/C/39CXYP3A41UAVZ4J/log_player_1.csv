I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  While it seems like a large imbalance, I'm banking on Bob's potential fear of the inflation affecting his potential gains in later rounds. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation factor.  It's likely that the longer we play, the less money I'll get, so accepting this offer ensures I get something substantial."
