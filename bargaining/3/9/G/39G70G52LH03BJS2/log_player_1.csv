"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original amount, so I'm effectively getting 4000 / 0.8 = 5000. However, I'm getting less than my initial offer, so I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already taken its toll, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm trying to get a bigger share, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'll calculate my effective gain as 4500 / 0.5192 (1 - 0.4808) = 8684. I'm getting more than my initial offer, and it's a better deal than the previous one. I'll accept this offer.
