**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me, but her offers are still heavily skewed in her favor.  While time is a factor, accepting a deal this bad sets a terrible precedent for future rounds. I need to show her I'm serious about a more equitable split."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to panic, which means my strategy is working.  She's trying to use intimidation tactics, but her offer is still far below a reasonable split.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a better deal."
