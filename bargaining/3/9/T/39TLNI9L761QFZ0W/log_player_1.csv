This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's still a fair amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, and we're already losing money due to inflation. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to stick with a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a reasonable compromise that hopefully Bob will accept. We've already lost some money to inflation, and I want to end this game before things get worse!"
