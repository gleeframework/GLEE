Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, we're losing money fast! This offer is a good compromise - it's more than I asked for last round, and it lets us both walk away with a respectable amount before inflation eats away at it any further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
