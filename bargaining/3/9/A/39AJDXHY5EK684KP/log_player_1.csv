"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. You can either accept or propose a different split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% of the remaining amount, but I'll take 60% for myself. It's a good deal, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (in terms of purchasing power)
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 (in terms of purchasing power)

Considering the reduced purchasing power, I'll have to be careful. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less from the first round, and another 20% less from the second round), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more than my previous offer. Let's aim for a 42% split. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll take the lion's share. You can't resist this offer, can you? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate the actual amounts in terms of purchasing power:

* My gain: 3000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = 5811.13 (in terms of purchasing power)
* Bob's gain: 7000 / 0.5168 = 13543.11 (in terms of purchasing power)

Considering the reduced purchasing power, I'll have to be careful. However, I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I won't regret it.
