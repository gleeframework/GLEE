Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I'm also looking for a more equitable outcome. Let's split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
