Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be realistic. This time, I get $70, and you get $30. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking (and the money is shrinking). 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
