This is a very lopsided offer.  While it's tempting to take something, I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal. The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I'll see if I can take advantage of that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
I'm offering Alice a 40% share, which is still a decent amount for her.  I'm hoping this is enough to make her accept before the inflation hits her too hard."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much more favorable now that inflation has kicked in.  Although it's less than my initial offer, it's a decent amount and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the future."
