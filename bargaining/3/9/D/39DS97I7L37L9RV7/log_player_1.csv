"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is becoming less valuable quickly.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money losing value."
