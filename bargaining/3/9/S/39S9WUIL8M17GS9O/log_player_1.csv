I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the lion's share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's still a decent amount for him.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy!  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to be more reasonable in the next round.  The inflation is definitely making things more difficult, but I'm not going to settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation and Bob's last offer. This still gives me a majority of the money, but I'm offering a larger share to Bob in the hopes of reaching an agreement. I think this is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
