"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice, given the risk of inflation. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the risk of inflation. Even though we don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's likely that it will impact both of us. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a proposal in the next round, potentially securing a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split of 5500 for me and 4500 for you. It's a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose an equal division of the money. This way, we both have a fair share without risking too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing, it's the best option at this point. I've already lost a significant portion of my potential gains due to inflation, and further rounds will only decrease my share further. Accepting the offer secures a decent amount of money, albeit less than what I initially aimed for."
