"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a better return on my investment. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3200 in the previous round's value. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth more or less due to inflation, but I'm willing to take a chance.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
