Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking! This is my final offer. It's the best you'll get considering how much we're both losing with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

It seems Alice is unwilling to budge further, and continuing the game would only result in both of us losing more value."
