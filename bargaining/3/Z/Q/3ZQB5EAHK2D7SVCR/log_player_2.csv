Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rejection of the previous offer and the potential impact of inflation, I propose a 55/45 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the value erosion over time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
