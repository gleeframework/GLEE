"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the low offer, or it gets worse! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $2,000 is still a significant amount. However, I'm hesitant to accept an offer that gives Bob $8,000, which is 80% of the total.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a fair deal""}

I'm increasing my own share to $6,000, hoping to make up for the lost opportunity in the previous round. I'm still willing to compromise and give Bob $4,000, hoping he'll accept this revised offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

While I'm not thrilled about the offer, I'm starting to get a bit desperate. $3,000 is a decent amount, but I'm worried that if I reject this offer, things might get even worse.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and not try to lowball me further.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
