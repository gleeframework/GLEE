"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I take the lion's share, you get a small starting point.  We can negotiate later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and while I appreciate Alice's ""fairness"", that offer is way too lopsided. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. We both get a good chunk, and there's no need to risk the money decreasing with each round.""}
