"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept the offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation we'll both face if we continue negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 550,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the next round, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 392500,
  ""bob_gain"": 607500,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering to take 39.25% of the original $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 60.75%. The message is a gentle nudge to try to get Bob to accept a more balanced split."
