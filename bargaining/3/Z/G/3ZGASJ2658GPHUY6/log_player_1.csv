"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in Round 2, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer. My gain of $4000 in Round 2 is equivalent to $5000 in Round 1, which is a decent amount.

However, Bob's gain of $6000 in Round 2 is equivalent to $6000 in Round 1, which is a significant amount. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving him the majority of the money, especially considering the inflation factor.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too. Let's try this.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount, while keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up my advantage yet 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in Round 1:

My gain of $4800 in Round 4 is equivalent to $9600 in Round 1, which is a decent amount.

Bob's gain of $5200 in Round 4 is equivalent to $7800 in Round 1, which is a significant amount.

Considering the inflation factor, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I think I can do better than this.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you less, but I need a bigger share now. Let's try this.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% and giving Bob 40%. This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to persuade him to accept. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to give up my advantage, but I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in Round 1:

My gain of $4600 in Round 6 is equivalent to $14,400 in Round 1, which is a decent amount.

Bob's gain of $5400 in Round 6 is equivalent to $16,200 in Round 1, which is a significant amount.

Considering the inflation factor, I'm not getting a great deal, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. I think I should take what I can get.
