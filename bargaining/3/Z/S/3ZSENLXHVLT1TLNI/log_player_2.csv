"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your starting point, but this needs to be more equitable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's settle this quickly and avoid further losses due to inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most reasonable.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking to a highly unfavorable split. While the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, it's still worth holding out for a better deal. Accepting 40% now sets a weak precedent and doesn't reflect the time pressure on Alice as well."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise. We're both losing money by dragging this out. 52/48 is fair considering the time pressure and the fact that you lose less to inflation than I do.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that I am being more than reasonable with the split.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  While the pressure is mounting, Alice is still trying to leverage a position of strength that is quickly eroding.  She knows the clock is ticking louder for me, but her offers haven't reflected a true sense of urgency or compromise. Holding out for another round is a calculated risk, but it's important to show I won't be pressured into a bad deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point.  We're both feeling the squeeze of inflation now.  Let's end this on a fair and equal note.""
