"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share. Accept this and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. This way, we both get a significant amount and can move on to the next round with a good chunk of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 in this round is equivalent to $405,000 in the first round, which is a 40.5% share of the initial $1,000,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 in this round is equivalent to $490,000 in the first round, which is a 49% share of the initial $1,000,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the deal, as it seems Bob is trying to take a larger share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the next round.
