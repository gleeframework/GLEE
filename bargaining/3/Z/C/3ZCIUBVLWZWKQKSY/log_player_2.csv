"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the initial offer seems appealing, Alice's phrasing suggests she might be open to a more favorable split later.  Given the steep inflation against Alice, it's worth seeing if she'll propose a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's make a deal! This round is important for both of us given the inflation.  This offer benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I've compromised. This is a fair deal considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation much more than Bob. While she calls this compromise ""fair,"" it's barely better than her first offer, which was already in her favor.  Bob can afford to wait another round or two and see if Alice panics and offers a significantly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking!  This is a strong offer considering how quickly the value is shrinking. Let's close this deal and both benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a fair deal. Inflation is killing me, let's split it 50/50 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice is finally feeling the heat of the inflation. A 50/50 split is a decent outcome for Bob considering the circumstances. Waiting any longer is very risky. Alice is desperate enough to offer a fair deal, and she might drastically lowball Bob in the next round out of panic."
