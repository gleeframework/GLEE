Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best option for me, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."

I'm not convinced that 35 is a fairer split, especially since the money is worth even less due to inflation. I think I can still get a better deal. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further.

I'll aim to get a slightly higher share, considering the decreasing value of the money."
