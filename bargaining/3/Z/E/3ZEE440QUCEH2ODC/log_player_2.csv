# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take a bit more since I'm the one proposing, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
