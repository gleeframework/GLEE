"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of him rejecting the offer and potentially causing inflation to kick in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I'm getting significantly less than I initially proposed, it's still better than nothing. Considering the inflation, accepting this offer is the most sensible option."
