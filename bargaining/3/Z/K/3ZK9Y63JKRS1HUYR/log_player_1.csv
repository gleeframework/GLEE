"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 10% decrease in value for me and the 5% decrease for Bob, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly higher share, but still leave some room for Bob to negotiate."
