"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll be fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I'm still looking for a good deal. However, with Bob's offer, I'll be gaining 40, which is less than what I proposed in the first round. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain of 60 is actually worth 48, which is a significant amount. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

For now, I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in favor of Bob, I'll try to adjust my proposal to counter that. I'll offer a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a bit more in my favor than the previous 50/50 split, but still a relatively fair offer.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```"
