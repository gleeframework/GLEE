6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I'll take the majority, you get a small share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Equal division seems fair to me. It's better than risking getting less in the next rounds.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"I'll take a bigger share, you get a tiny share, but it's better than getting nothing after 3 rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 50-50 split is too risky. Let's aim for a 45-55 split. This gives us both a decent share without taking too much risk.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500.0,9500.0,"I'll take a huge share, you get a tiny fraction, but it's getting late and I need to secure my gain.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I propose a 40-60 split. This is a balanced approach, considering the diminishing value of money with each round.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
250.0,9750.0,"I'll take almost all the money, you get a tiny fraction, it's getting desperate now.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
3500.0,6500.0,A 35-65 split seems reasonable. It balances our shares while considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation.,Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
125.0,9875.0,"I'll take almost all the money, you get a tiny fraction, it's almost the last chance to make a deal.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"A 30-70 split might be a fair compromise. It's still a significant portion of the total, despite the inflation.",Alice,11,

100.0,9900.0,"It's the last round, I'll take almost all the money, you get a tiny fraction, it's now or never.",Bob,12,
