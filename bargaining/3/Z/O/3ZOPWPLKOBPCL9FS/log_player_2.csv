Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, this is the same deal you offered me, but with inflation eating away at your potential gains, it's even more in your best interest to accept now.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway, but you're running out of time. This is a fair offer considering the inflation.  Take it before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but with the current rate of inflation, waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal for me. It's frustrating that Alice is being so stubborn, but taking the $350,000 now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
