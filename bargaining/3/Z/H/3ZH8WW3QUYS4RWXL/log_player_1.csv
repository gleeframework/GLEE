"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I propose a split that gives me almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar. I figure this is the best way to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
