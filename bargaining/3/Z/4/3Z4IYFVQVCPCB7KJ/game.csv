750000.0,250000.0,I propose dividing the $1000000 with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Alice. This is a fair offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the diminishing value of the money, but also accounts for the fact that I am taking the risk of the money depreciating even further if we go to another round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I propose a 6:4 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the decreasing value of money in each round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
