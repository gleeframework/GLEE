"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $1,000,000 with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Alice. This is a fair offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the diminishing value of the money, but also accounts for the fact that I am taking the risk of the money depreciating even further if we go to another round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
