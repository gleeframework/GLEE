"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $1000000 with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Alice. This is a fair offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the diminishing value of the money, but also accounts for the fact that I am taking the risk of the money depreciating even further if we go to another round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I propose a 6:4 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the decreasing value of money in each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
