"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 30%. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need a majority to make it worth my while""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less now, my gain is worth even less. Considering Bob's offer, I think 75 is a relatively good share, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
