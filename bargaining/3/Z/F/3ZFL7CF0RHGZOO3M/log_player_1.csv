Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal, Alice. I'll take a slight advantage this round, and we can avoid the money losing value with further delays. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
