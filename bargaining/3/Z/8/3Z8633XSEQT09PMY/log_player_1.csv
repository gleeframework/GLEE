"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$ and keeping 80% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous, now it's time for me to take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in the second round, I'll consider the effective values.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $10, which is 10% of the effective 100$ (after 20% inflation from the first round).

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 40,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the effective values considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial 100$ -> 100 * 0.9 = 90$ (after round 1)
-> 90 * 0.9 = 81$ (after round 2)
-> 81 * 0.9 = 72.9$ (after round 3)
-> 72.9 * 0.723 = 52.7$ (after round 4)

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $30, which is 30% of the effective 100$ (after 52.7% inflation from the first round).

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the remaining value, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll take the last chance! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the effective values considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial 100$ -> 100 * 0.9 = 90$ (after round 1)
-> 90 * 0.9 = 81$ (after round 2)
-> 81 * 0.9 = 72.9$ (after round 3)
-> 72.9 * 0.723 = 52.7$ (after round 4)
-> 52.7 * 0.723 = 38.1$ (after round 5)
-> 38.1 * 0.596 = 22.73$ (after round 6)

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $15, which is 15% of the effective 100$ (after 76.7% inflation from the first round).

Considering the offer is quite low, I'll decide to reject this offer.

Note that I'm accepting the same offer I was previously offered by Bob in round 6, but now I'm making it to him."
