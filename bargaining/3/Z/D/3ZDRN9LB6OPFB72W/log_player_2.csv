"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but you get something to keep you interested. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 10 dollars is something, it's better to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll take my chances and hope Alice gets greedy in the next round.  I have 11 rounds left to improve this offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than 10 dollars. Let's split the money closer to the middle, but still give you a majority.  I'm sure we can work something out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something closer to 60 to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'm starting to lose too much money due to inflation, and Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise.  I'll take the 40 dollars and move on."
