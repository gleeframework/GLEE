"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's see if we can find common ground 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is now worth 40% of the original amount. I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd be giving up more than I'd like. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but I'll give you a bit more this time""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer while still being somewhat generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think I can live with this 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 30 is now worth 32.8% of the original amount. I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.
