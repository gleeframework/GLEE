"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a fair share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as he's taking the majority and leaving me with a smaller share. However, I'll consider it since it's still a proposal on the table.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, my potential gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%).

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly larger share while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8%).

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as he's still taking a larger share and I'm getting a smaller one. However, I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm getting a bit more cautious about accepting an offer that leaves me with a smaller share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, my potential gain is worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round (100% - 59.04%).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob! This is my last reasonable offer. Don't make me wait for another round!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but still hoping to get a decent share. I'm not sure how much longer I can wait for the next round, considering the effects of inflation."
