"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but not as generous as your offer. Let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept such a skewed proposal. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob now, I'll offer him a slightly larger share to make up for it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A fair compromise, considering the inflation. Let's split it this way!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give in too much. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor, considering the inflation rate. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation rate is now 68.8% less for Bob. I'll offer him a smaller share to reflect the reduced value of his potential gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a free ride! This is a more realistic offer, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still want to keep some leverage. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to stall and wait for the money to lose more value. I'll take advantage of his desperation and accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $500,000 and call it a day. It's not the best deal, but it's a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
