450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but it's not in my best interest. Let's be reasonable: I'll take $550,000, you take $450,000.  The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"I see you're eager to get a bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers? I'll take $580,000 and you get $420,000. Time is ticking, indeed!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, we're getting dangerously close to a lose-lose situation.  My offer is more than fair - it reflects the time pressure we're both under. Let's settle this now: $520,000 for me, $480,000 for you. Don't let inflation rob us blind.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"I understand your concerns about time pressure, but I still think your offer is too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to make a compromise: $560,000 for me and $440,000 for you. This is a fairer split, considering the inflation is affecting your share more than mine.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money by being stubborn. Let's split this evenly and get out of here before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. $500,000 each, take it or leave it. This is my final offer.",Bob,6,
