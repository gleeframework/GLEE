"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, now I'll take 70% and leave you with 30% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll try to get a better deal for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll give you 40%, but I'm taking 60% - it's a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share."
