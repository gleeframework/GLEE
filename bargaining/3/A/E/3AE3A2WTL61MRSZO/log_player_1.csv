"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start by being generous and giving Bob a small share.  This way, he might be inclined to accept, and we both get something without risking too much loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation will only continue to decrease the value of the money in the next round, making it less likely I'll get a better deal."
