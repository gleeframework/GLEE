"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair start too! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the original amount. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is 95% of $5,250 (the original amount I would have gotten in Round 1).

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to be more aggressive this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You can't do better than this, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me $7,000 and Bob $3,000. Let's see if Bob will take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly. In Round 1, I would have gotten $6,000, which is now worth 85.74% of that amount, so I would get $5,150.40. However, Bob's offer is $4,500, which is worth 90% of $5,000, so it's a better deal for me.

I'll think about it...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
