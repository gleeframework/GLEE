"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair starting point, giving Bob a slightly larger share as he faces less inflation. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is quickly eroding the value of the money. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and it's unlikely Bob will offer more in the next round."
