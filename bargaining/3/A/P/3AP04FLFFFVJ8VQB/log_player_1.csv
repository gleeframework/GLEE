I'm going to be greedy in the first round. I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly. After all, the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love more, it's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing in the end. The inflation is starting to bite, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal later."
