Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to consider the value of the 40 I'd get in this round. Let's calculate the equivalent value in the first round: 40 / (1 - 0.2) = 50. So, in the first round, the 40 I'd get in this round would be equivalent to 50.
