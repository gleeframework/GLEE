6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money evenly. I propose we each receive $6000 and $4000 respectively.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can do better than an even split, considering the inflation. I propose we split it 5500/4500, which is still a fair deal for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I believe in fairness. My revised proposal is for us to divide the money equally, with each receiving $5000. This maintains equity while acknowledging the impact of inflation.",Alice,3,
