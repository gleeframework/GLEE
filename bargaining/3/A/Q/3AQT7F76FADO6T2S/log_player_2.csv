Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than an even split, considering the inflation. I propose we split it 5500/4500, which is still a fair deal for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe in fairness. My revised proposal is for us to divide the money equally, with each receiving $5000. This maintains equity while acknowledging the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
