"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30, which is a 70-30 split. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the new amounts would be:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.50
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.50

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split.
