"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're leaving me with too little. I want more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is getting less valuable, and Bob's offer is even more generous than it seems!

However, I'm not willing to give up that much. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite generous, I'll try to make a more moderate offer this time.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I want a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is taking a toll! The money is getting less valuable fast!

Bob's offer is very similar to his previous one, but with a slight adjustment. I'm not sure if I'm willing to give him more this time.
