"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start with a clean slate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'll reject it for now.
