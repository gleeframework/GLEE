Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more. Inflation isn't affecting me, so I can wait 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offers are getting slightly better, they are still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal, and I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Okay, a more serious offer. This is a small win for you, but it's getting late, and I want to settle this before inflation hurts me more."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the inflation eats away at Bob's potential gains. It's important to apply pressure and highlight that waiting benefits Alice more than Bob.
* **Concession, but Strong Stance:** Offering 52/48 is a slight concession from the 50/50, making it more appealing to Alice. However, it's still a firm stance that Bob won't accept a heavily uneven deal.
* **Direct Language:**  The message is clear and to the point, emphasizing the urgency and the negative consequences of delay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're going in the wrong direction. Inflation is on my side, and I'm not budging much 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but her message reveals that she's aware of the pressure Bob is under.  Her offers are slowly creeping up, which means there's room for negotiation. Accepting 44/56 at this stage would be a mistake, as it sets a weak precedent and doesn't reflect the increasing urgency for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 51,
""alice_gain"": 49,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering a slight advantage for you, but this needs to end now. Every round costs me significantly. Don't let's both lose out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Urgency:** The message directly highlights the increasing cost of each round for Bob, emphasizing the shared risk of not reaching an agreement. 
* **Slight Retreat (Strategic):** Offering 51/49 is a small retreat from the previous 52/48. This might seem counterintuitive, but it serves two purposes: 
    * **Signals Flexibility:** It shows Alice that Bob is willing to negotiate and isn't fixed on one number.
    * **Creates a Time Trap:** It makes Alice think she might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more out of Bob in the next round, making her more likely to reject and continue, which is to Bob's disadvantage due to inflation.
* **Appeal to Reason:**  The phrase ""let's be realistic"" aims to shift the tone away from a pure bargaining game to a more collaborative decision-making process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not feeling generous. You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. Take this or risk getting less 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. Alice is right, time is working against me, and this offer is the best one yet. Let's analyze:

**Reasons to Accept:**

* **Best Offer So Far:** 45/55 is the highest amount offered to Bob so far.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, the inflation is going to severely impact any potential gains. Accepting now guarantees something.
* **Alice's Tone:**  Alice seems confident and unwilling to budge much more. Waiting could backfire.

**Reasons to Reject:**

* **Still Unfair:** It's a significant disadvantage for Bob, especially considering the initial inflation disadvantage. 
* **Possible Bluff:** Alice might be trying to scare me into accepting a less-than-ideal offer.

**Decision:**

This is a gamble. I think I have to reject one more time to test Alice's resolve. However, if she doesn't significantly improve her offer in the next round, I'll have to accept, even if it's unfair.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. My final offer - a fair 50/50 split. If you refuse, I'll accept your 45/55 in the next round.  Don't let greed make us both losers.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This is a clear ultimatum, conveying the seriousness of the situation and the limited options remaining.
* **Fairness:**  Returning to a 50/50 split emphasizes the principle of fairness, which might appeal to Alice's sense of reason, especially now that Bob has demonstrated willingness to walk away.
* **Clear Consequence:**  By stating his intention to accept the previous offer if this one is rejected, Bob creates a clear and undesirable consequence for Alice if she continues to be uncompromising.
* **Appeal to Shared Interest:**  The closing sentence reminds Alice that rejecting this offer could lead to a lose-lose situation, appealing to her rational side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said you'd accept this, so here it is. Last chance before we both lose 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice called my bluff. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's better than getting nothing in the final round. Accepting now secures a payout, even though it's heavily skewed in Alice's favor. This was a tough negotiation, and Alice's strategic use of the time pressure and inflation worked to her advantage."
