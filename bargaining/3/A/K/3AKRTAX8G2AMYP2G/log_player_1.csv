Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair deal!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take the majority of the money, leaving me with a relatively small share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
