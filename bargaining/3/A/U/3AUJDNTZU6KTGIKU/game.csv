4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're running out of time and losing money with each round. This is my final offer - it's a good deal considering the inflation is hitting you harder.  Let's be sensible and close this out.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than your last offer to me, even though the inflation is hurting me worse.  Let's be reasonable and end this here.",Alice,5,
