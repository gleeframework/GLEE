"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000-100,000 split in my favor. I figure Bob will be happy to take any money, and I'll get the most out of the deal before inflation starts eating away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject the offer. While it's better than nothing, the inflation means I'm only getting 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000 in real value. I can do better by holding out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000-400,000 split. The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to get a bigger share to make it worth my while.  I think Bob will see this as a fair compromise given the changing circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. With inflation, my share is worth 200,000 * 0.729 = 145,800 in real value. While this is much lower than what I initially hoped for, it's still more than I would get if I keep rejecting offers and face even more inflation. It's time to cut my losses and secure some money."
