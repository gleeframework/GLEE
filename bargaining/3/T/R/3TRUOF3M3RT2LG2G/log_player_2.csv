"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a similar present value of the money. Let's be fair to each other from the start.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a good starting point. However, due to inflation, the value of the money decreases faster for you. This offer accounts for that and ensures a more equitable outcome considering the future rounds.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems you're overestimating your position's strength.  This is my final offer reflecting a reasonable split given the circumstances.  Let's end this now and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4973 
# Alice gain: 5027 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is very close to her round 1 offer, but now it's even more in my favor due to the inflation working against her. It's unlikely she'll offer me a better deal in subsequent rounds.
