Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more even split is fair, considering we both want to minimize the impact of inflation.

# Bob gain: 450000

""alice_gain"": 650000,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting closer, but I still believe a more even split is necessary to compensate for the loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly affected by the inflation, but he's still not reflecting the urgency in his offers.  I need to push him a bit further to get a more favorable split while the ""inflation clock"" is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 625000,
""bob_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. The longer we wait, the less your share will be worth. It's time to be pragmatic.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small concession from the last round to signal some flexibility, but making it clear this is my final offer. The goal is to convey a sense of urgency and get Bob to accept before the value depreciates further for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle of our last offers. 
# Alice gain: 572500 
# Bob gain: 427500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is significantly better than Bob's previous offers and represents a reasonable compromise. Accepting now secures a decent amount before inflation erodes Bob's share further, potentially leading to worse offers in subsequent rounds.  It's crucial to recognize that holding out indefinitely carries the risk of Bob offering even less favorable terms later."
