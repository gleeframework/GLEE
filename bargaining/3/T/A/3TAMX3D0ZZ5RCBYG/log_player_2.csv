"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I take a slightly larger share to account for the inflation affecting me each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation, I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself. I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 5500 to 4500 in your favor, Alice. This is a fair compromise given the inflation. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting closer to yours, but I still need a bit more to account for the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's close the deal! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, this is a good deal given the inflation and the limited rounds.  I'm accepting to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
