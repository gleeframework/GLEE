Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure I'll take the lion's share since I'm making the first offer, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm accepting Bob's offer. Even with the inflation factor, I'm getting something, and it's likely that if I reject this, the next round will be worse for me."
