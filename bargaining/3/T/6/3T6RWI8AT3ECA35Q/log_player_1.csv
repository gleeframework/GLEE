"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth $5,400, and the $4,000 I offered to you is now worth $3,600.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have $5,000 and you'll have $5,000. This is a more even split than my original offer, and it's a better deal for me given the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
