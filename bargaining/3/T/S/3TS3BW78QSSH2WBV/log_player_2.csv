Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't wait, the money is losing value! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the faster inflation rate Bob is experiencing. While the offer might seem tempting as time pressure increases, accepting it would mean settling for significantly less than what Bob could potentially secure. It's time to apply more pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is my final offer - a perfectly even split.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining and both players losing money rapidly, it's crucial to secure a deal soon. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Presenting a 50/50 split highlights fairness and leaves less room for Alice to argue. It might be more appealing to her now that the pressure is mounting. 
* **Finality:**  By stating it's a final offer, there's added pressure on Alice to accept, knowing Bob might be even less flexible in subsequent rounds."
