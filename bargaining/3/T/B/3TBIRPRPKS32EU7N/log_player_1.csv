"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a good offer for me. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I would like to aim for a slightly better split. Meeting in the middle might not be enough to compensate for the reduced value of my share. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better split considering the inflation. This way, I'll still get a decent amount, but it's not too far off from the original 60%.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but I think this is a reasonable split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with this offer. Although Bob is willing to take a slightly bigger share, the split is still heavily skewed in his favor. Considering the significant reduction in the value of my share due to inflation, I think I should aim for a better split. I'd like to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 48% is a fairer split considering the current value of the money. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a more balanced split.""}

I'm proposing that I get 48% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 52%."
