I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy of offering a larger share for myself, but with a slightly smaller gap. I think this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in my position.  I'll offer $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's clear that Bob is trying to push for a 80/20 split, but I won't accept such a drastic imbalance.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and find a middle ground. I'll propose a 70/30 split, giving myself $700,000 and Bob $300,000.  I'm willing to give a little more, but I'm still hoping for a reasonable share of the money."

# Bob gain: 700000

I'm sticking to my guns.  The inflation is hurting me, but I'm not going to cave to his demands just yet. I'll hold out for a more even split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm still trying to find a middle ground. I'll propose a 60/40 split, giving myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000.  Time is running out, but I'm not willing to settle for less than this."
