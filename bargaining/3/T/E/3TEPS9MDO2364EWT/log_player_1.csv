"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a very reasonable amount considering the current market conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that will satisfy both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate.

I'll take a closer look at his offer. With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of 450,000 is actually a smaller share of the total amount than before. I'll reject his offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob! Don't be shy!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a good chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script.

I'll take a closer look at his new offer. With the money worth 22.62% less than in the first round, Bob's gain of 480,000 is actually a smaller share of the total amount than before. However, considering the current market conditions, I think this offer is a decent compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
