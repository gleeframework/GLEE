Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you get 40.""
}

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share this time.  It's a good starting point for negotiation.

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's offer.
