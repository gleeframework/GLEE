"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal! Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd love to get more, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. This is a decent compromise, and it's better than risking getting a worse deal in the next round. Let's end this game."
