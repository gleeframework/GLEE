Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Time is money, and it's literally losing value! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
