"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose.  I figure this is a good starting point, as I get a larger share, but Bob still gets a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is far too unfavorable.  Even with the inflation penalty, I would rather see the game continue."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor this time.  This is still a sizable advantage for me, but it's more reasonable than my previous proposal."
