"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation rates. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This one is more realistic""
}
```

I've reduced my offer slightly, considering the inflation, but still trying to be relatively fair. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
