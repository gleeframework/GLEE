"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly. My message is a friendly one, inviting him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a more modest offer. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation. I need to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to accept a gain of only $100,000, especially considering the reduced value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're being cautious, I'll meet you in the middle. Accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal, with a larger share for him, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can move forward. My message is a friendly one, inviting him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up. I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although it's not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I don't want to risk losing more value by rejecting the offer. I'll take the $300,000 and hope it's enough."
