"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, let's start with a 60/40 split.  This gives you a strong lead, and I believe it's a good foundation for a successful negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
