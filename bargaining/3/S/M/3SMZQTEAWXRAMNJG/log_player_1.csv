"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a higher share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my money is now worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer in the previous round was a bit better than mine, so I'll try to make a more competitive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up my advantage!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 65% of the $100 and Bob gets 35%. This is a slightly better offer than Bob's previous one, and I'm hoping it will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out. Given the inflation, my money is now worth significantly less than in the first round. I need to be careful not to give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much ground yet!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to try to get a higher share of the money, even if it means going into the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant inflation, my money is now worth a lot less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob! Time to make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively even split, but I'm trying to assert my position after rejecting Bob's previous offer."
