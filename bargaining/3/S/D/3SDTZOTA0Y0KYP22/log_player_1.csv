"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep a majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my 4000$ gain is now worth 4,000 / 0.95 = 4210.53$ in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think it's a decent offer. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
