"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. It's a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. 55-45 is a fairer split, don't you think?""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still leaves me with a slightly larger share."
