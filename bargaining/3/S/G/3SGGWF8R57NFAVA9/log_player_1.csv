"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I take 75$, and you take 25$. This ensures we both have some share, but I'm willing to give you a larger portion to encourage acceptance.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation rate favors me more, and it allows for a more equitable distribution than the previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
