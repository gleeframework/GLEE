"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll need to adjust my strategy.

I accept Bob's offer.
