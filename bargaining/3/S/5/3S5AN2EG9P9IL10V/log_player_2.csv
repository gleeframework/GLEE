"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'm willing to give you 40% of the money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While 40% is a decent starting point, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to offer more.  Since I (Bob) am only losing 10% of the value per round, I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We both get the same amount and we can move on.""}
```"
