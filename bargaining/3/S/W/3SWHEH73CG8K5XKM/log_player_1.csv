"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly and avoid the risk of getting nothing.  Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much lower than mine, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to compromise a little from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. Let's see if Bob is more receptive to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. I'm going to keep rejecting until I can get a better deal. We're running out of time, but I'm not going to give up without a fight."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. We're getting close to the end of the game, so I need to find a balance between getting a fair share and avoiding the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal. We are running out of time, but I'm not going to give up."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're approaching the end of the game, and it seems like we're both unwilling to budge much. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like the fairest option at this point.  It's a compromise for both of us, but it's better than getting nothing."
