Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as it gives Bob something to work with while still being fair to me. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair deal, considering the inflation.  I'd rather take the sure 5000 now than risk getting nothing in the end!"
