Let's see what I can get!  I want more than 40% of the money."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of going to the next round. What do you say?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a better split. Let's try again! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it!  I'd rather secure the 450,000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
