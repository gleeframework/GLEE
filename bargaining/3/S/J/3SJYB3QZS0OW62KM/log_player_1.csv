Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 for Bob. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80
