Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. This offer still acknowledges that inflation affects me more, but it's more balanced than your previous one. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still getting the better end of the deal, even with the inflation working against her.  While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, we're still in the early rounds. It's worth holding out for a better offer."
