"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what I can propose in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice!""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I want to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement quickly. By offering a 40-60 split, I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer before the value of the money decreases further. Fingers crossed!"
