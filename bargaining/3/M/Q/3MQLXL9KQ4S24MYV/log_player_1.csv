Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that is favorable to me, but still leaves some for Bob. I think this will incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less to Bob, he's offering a 50/50 split, which is a much better deal than the 10% he was initially offered.  It's not worth risking a lower offer in the next round."
