"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split the money. I propose taking $60 and you get $40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation will hurt you more than me. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 
Explanation:

This deal is heavily skewed in Bob's favor. While he claims it's fair due to inflation, he's using that as a cover to take a much larger share.  It's worth going through a few more rounds to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. Let's meet in the middle - I propose a 55/45 split. This way we both get something substantial before the value drops too much.""
