"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 50/50, considering the value of money is decreasing, it's a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
