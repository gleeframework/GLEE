"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is 400,000, that's equivalent to 450,000 in the first round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's not a significant enough concession from Bob.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share of the money, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the decreased value of the money, Bob's offer is actually quite close to a 50-50 split, but with a slight bias towards his favor.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not. Since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll try to be more cautious and aim for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm aiming to get a larger share of the money, considering the reduced value due to inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential gains. Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a decent one, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. The 520,000 he's offering is equivalent to 520,000 in the first round, which is a relatively small concession.

I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll try to be more cautious and aim for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.
