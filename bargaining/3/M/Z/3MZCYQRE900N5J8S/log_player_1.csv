"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take this generous offer and let's end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a fair share and let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than the original $1,000,000, so I'm now considering a proposal that's worth $800,000 (20% of $1,000,000).

Bob's proposal is to give me $300,000, which is worth 37.5% of the original amount ($1,000,000). This is a relatively low share, but I'll have to consider the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'll try to negotiate for a better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 80% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and share the remaining wealth!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining wealth. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% of its original value, my gain is now worth $484,000 (48.8% of $1,000,000).

Bob's offer is to give me $450,000, which is worth 45% of the original amount ($1,000,000). This is a slightly better offer than before, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate for a better share.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 40.96% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no more haggling! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 32.77% of its original value, my gain is now worth $326,700 (32.77% of $1,000,000).

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair offer considering the remaining value of the money. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal at this point, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll accept this offer.
