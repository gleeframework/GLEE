"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This way, we both get a decent share and the inflation issue is somewhat mitigated. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
