Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still not 50/50 considering inflation, let's try this 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but time is running out. Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer we wait, the less my share is worth. A 4300 offer now is better than hoping for 5000 later when it might be worth even less due to inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice seems fixated on getting a larger share, even with my concessions. There's no guarantee she'll ever agree to a truly even split.

It's not ideal, but sometimes getting a decent deal is better than holding out for a perfect one that might never come."
