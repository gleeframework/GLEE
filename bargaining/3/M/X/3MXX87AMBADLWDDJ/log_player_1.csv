"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I can do better. I'll give you a counteroffer!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to get a decent chunk for myself. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 56% of the money, and Bob gets 44%. The message is a bit more assertive, indicating that I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the drastic reduction in value of the money I'll gain, I think I should accept Bob's offer. It's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk getting even less in subsequent rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you got me! I'll take your offer. It's a fair deal.""
}
```"
