"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less, so I'm more inclined to accept a smaller share. I'll accept Bob's offer.
