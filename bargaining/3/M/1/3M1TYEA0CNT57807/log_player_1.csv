"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 70% and you get 30%""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's still a decent offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we're both taking a risk in this game.  Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll receive $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, Bob. I'd like to see a more even split. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll receive $380,000 * 0.95 = $361,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, Bob. 55/45 split seems fair, considering the risks we're taking.""
}
