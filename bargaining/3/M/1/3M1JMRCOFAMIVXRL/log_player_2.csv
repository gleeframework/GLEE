"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected the offer, I get to make the proposal for Round 2. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50-50 split in Alice's previous offer."
