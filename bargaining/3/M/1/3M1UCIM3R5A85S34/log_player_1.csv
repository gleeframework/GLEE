Bob is undervaluing the impact of inflation on my gains. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significantly smaller share."

{
""alice_gain"": 58,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split.  Every round that passes hurts us both. Take the deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This is a tempting offer, as it appears ""fair"" on the surface. However, Bob is drastically undervaluing the impact of inflation on my potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage would be a significant loss for me compared to the earlier rounds.  I need to push for a slightly better deal while remaining aware of the dwindling time."
