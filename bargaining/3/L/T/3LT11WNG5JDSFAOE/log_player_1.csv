"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $50 each. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but it's still a good start 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is taking the lead, and his offer is a bit biased towards himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I don't think it's fair. I'm willing to compromise, but 40/60 is not a good starting point for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55, which is a bit more than my initial 50, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, you can't refuse 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting aggressive! His offer is quite biased towards himself, and I'm not comfortable with a 30/70 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's unfair. I'm not going to let him take the majority of the money without a fight! I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."

# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really pushing his luck! His offer is extremely biased towards himself, and I'm not comfortable with a 25/75 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's just too one-sided. I'm not going to let him take 75% of the money without a serious fight. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'm not going to give in easily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

I'm increasing my share to 65, which is a bit more than my previous offer, and still leaves a decent amount for Bob. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him, but I'm not getting desperate yet."

# Bob's message: I'm taking control, you're running out of options 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting aggressive! His offer is extremely biased towards himself, and I'm not comfortable with a 20/80 split. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not giving up yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's just too one-sided. I'm not going to let him take 80% of the money without a serious fight. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'm running out of time and options."

# Bob's message: I'm taking the majority, it's my last chance 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","NO! This is unacceptable! Bob's offer is a complete disaster, and I'm not going to let him take 90% of the money. I'm not going to give up now, I'll make one last stand. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's a complete joke. I'm not going to let him take 90% of the money, not when I've been fighting for a fair share this whole time. I'll make one more offer, and if he rejects it, I'll walk away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","This is it, my last chance. I'm going to make a final offer that I think is fair, and if Bob rejects it, I'll walk away with nothing. Here's my last offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 42% of the money, which is the highest share he's had so far, and I'm taking 58%. I think this is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he rejects it, I'll walk away with nothing, and he'll get nothing too."

Do you accept this offer?","NO! That's it, I've had enough! Bob's offer is completely unacceptable, and I'm not going to let him take 95% of the money. I've fought for a fair share this whole time, and I'm not going to give up now. Since this is the last round, I'll reject his offer and walk away with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's a complete joke. I'd rather walk away with nothing than let him take 95% of the money. I'm done playing this game."
