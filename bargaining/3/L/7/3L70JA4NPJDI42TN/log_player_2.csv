"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value.""}
``` 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The money loses value rapidly for both of us. It's better to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Fairness with a Twist:** While a 50/50 split seems initially fair,  I'm getting hit harder by the inflation.  My offer is a slight edge in my favor to compensate for the faster devaluation of the money for me. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message directly addresses the changing value and positions my offer as a pragmatic solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Significant Devaluation:** The money is losing value quickly. Delaying further significantly hurts my potential gains.
* **Improved Offer:** Alice's offer has shifted in my favor compared to her Round 1 proposal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal in Round 4 is very risky. Alice is likely aware of the devaluation and might not budge much, leaving me with even less in the end."
