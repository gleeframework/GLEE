"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the smaller share, I'll take the lion's share.""
}
```

I'm making a generous offer to Bob, but I'm also being realistic about the fact that I want to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting all the money that easily! I'm taking a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I don't think 300,000 is a fair share, considering the initial amount was 1,000,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too little for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle! Take 40% of the original amount, I'll take 60%.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives me a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still getting a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that 450,000 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is still getting a larger share.

I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not settling for that. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a better deal. Take 45% of the original amount, I'll take 55%.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and being willing to compromise."
