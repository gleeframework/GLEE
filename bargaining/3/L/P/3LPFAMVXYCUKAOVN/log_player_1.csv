"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move. I'll take the whole $100, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate and we can work out a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair division where we each receive half of the money. This ensures mutual benefit and trust. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair division, eh? That's a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I'm ready to settle just yet. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Half is a good start, but I was thinking of getting a bit more. Can you offer me 60, and we can call it a day?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This offer should be fair, considering the value of money is decreasing.""
}
```"
