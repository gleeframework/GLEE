"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20. You can have the smaller share if you want.""
}

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.
