"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to aim for a more balanced split, and 60-40 is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll wait for a better offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's previous offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

This way, I'm still offering a relatively balanced split, but with a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a bit more in his favor. I'll think about it...

I'll decide to reject this offer as well. The difference between 55-45 and 58-42 is not significant enough to warrant accepting an offer that's still slightly skewed in Bob's favor.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to be more aggressive with my next offer, since Bob has been pushing for a slightly larger share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This time, I'm matching Bob's previous offer, but I'm not willing to give up more."
