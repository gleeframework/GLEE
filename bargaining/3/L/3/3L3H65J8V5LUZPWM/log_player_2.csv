"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take most, but you get a decent chunk to begin with.  Hopefully we can work towards a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's a very uneven split.  I want to see if I can get a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split is the most logical way to divide the money.""
