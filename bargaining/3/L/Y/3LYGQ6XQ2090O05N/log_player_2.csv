"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 3:1 in favor of Bob, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While this is a good offer for me in the first round, I'm aware of the inflation effect. If I reject, I'll be in control of the next offer, and I can likely get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation we'll both experience in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob, aiming for a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even with the inflation, this is a decent offer, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
