I'll start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he accepts it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. It's not fair, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'll offer Bob 100,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm taking a larger share for myself, knowing that the inflation will impact the value of the money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still far from what I think is fair.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm offering Bob 200,000, a significant amount, but I need to secure a larger share for myself due to the increasing inflation."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the value of the money I would get is significantly less due to inflation, I'm going to reject this offer.  I can still get a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a more significant risk here, offering Bob a larger share to try and secure a deal before the inflation further devalues my portion.  I need to balance the risk of rejection with the need to get something before the game ends."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  The value of the money I get is very low, but I'm worried if I reject, I might end up with nothing.  I'll accept this offer and get at least something."
