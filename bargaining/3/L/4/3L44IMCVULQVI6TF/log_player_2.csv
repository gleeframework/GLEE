Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you want a larger share.  How about $65 for me and $35 for you? This offer is better than you'll get if we wait much longer.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're feeling the inflation pinch!  I'm offering you $40, which is more than you'd get if you wait much longer. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $40 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round for Bob. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to her advantage. She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this, knowing Bob is incentivized to take a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer is too risky.  If Bob rejects this, there's no guarantee he can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds.  

It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed $40 now (even with the inflated value) than risk getting nothing at all if the rounds run out.
