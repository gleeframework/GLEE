Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. This will give us both a good starting point and we can adjust further in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
