"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, and Bob gets a reasonable amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 55 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of 60 in the previous round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the numbers, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is taking its toll! Since my gains are worth 20% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share this time to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains! With my gains worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my offer of 70 in round 3 is now equivalent to 36.4. Bob's offer of 20 in this round is actually a significant decrease from his previous offer of 45.

Considering the drastic drop in value of my potential gains, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
