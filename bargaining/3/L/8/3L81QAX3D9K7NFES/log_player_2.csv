Alice is slowly increasing her offer, but it's still  beneficial for me to hold out a bit longer. The inflation is hurting, but I think I can get her closer to a 50/50 split, or at least a significantly better deal for me."

Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5600

This is a tough one! It's tempting to hold out for more, but here's why I'm accepting:

* **Inflation is brutal:**  The value of the money is plummeting for me. Each round makes a significant difference. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:** She's consistently increased her offer, but in tiny increments.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject, there's a chance I could get even less in subsequent rounds, especially if Alice digs in her heels.

It's not ideal, but it's better to take a smaller but guaranteed amount than risk ending up with nothing."
