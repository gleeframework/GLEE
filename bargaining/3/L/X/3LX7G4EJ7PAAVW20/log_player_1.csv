I'm starting with a fairly even split, but I want to get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer.  I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want to get a larger share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
