Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than you. I'm proposing a 52/48 split, which is a smaller gain for me than last round, considering the inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
