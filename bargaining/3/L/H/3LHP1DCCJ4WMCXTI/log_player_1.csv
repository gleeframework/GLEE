**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes on, the more Alice loses due to inflation. Accepting now guarantees her a reasonable sum.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on an even split. Rejecting this offer and hoping for a significantly better deal in later rounds is highly unlikely.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly with each rejection. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes a compromise is necessary to avoid a worse outcome."
