"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a relatively fair split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to give you a better deal later 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is offering a better deal later. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 20% share for now, hoping that Bob will follow through on his promise to give me a better deal later."
