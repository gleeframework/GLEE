I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution. I'm taking a larger share, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a quick deal.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, it's still far from fair considering the inflation affecting both of us.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is still generous, but it takes into account the inflation we've both experienced.  It also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair share.  Let's see if he accepts this time!"
