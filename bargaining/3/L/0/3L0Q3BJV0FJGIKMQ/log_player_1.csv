Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a more mutually beneficial split. This time I'm offering you a smaller share, but I believe it's still a good deal given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
