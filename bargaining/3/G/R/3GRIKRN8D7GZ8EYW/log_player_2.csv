Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress, and the deal is getting worse for her due to inflation. While her offer is slightly better, I believe I can push for a more favorable outcome by continuing to reject and proposing slightly better offers for myself in the next few rounds."
