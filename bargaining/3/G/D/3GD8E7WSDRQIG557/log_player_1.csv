"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm suggesting we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount of money and avoid any potential disputes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the loss. However, I don't want to give up too much to Bob.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, and I rejected it, I'll try to do slightly better this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away all the profit""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal to make it worth my while 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Considering the inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly. A 70-30 split is a significant improvement for me, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make it worth my while.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
