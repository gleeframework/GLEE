Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly.  I figure this is a good starting point, giving Bob a small amount to consider but still giving me the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time, recognizing that the value of the money is decreasing.  60/40 is still slightly in my favor, but hopefully Bob sees it as a fair compromise given the inflation."
