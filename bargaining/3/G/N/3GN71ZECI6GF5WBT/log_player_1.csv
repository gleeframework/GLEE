"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 75% and you get 25%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money upfront, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll split it 50/50, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to split it 50/50, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to split it 50/50. I'll make a new offer: I'll take 60% and you get 40%. Let's see if you're willing to accept.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a good chunk of the money. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer, and the inflation is taking its toll. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better one. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll take this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. I'll take $450,000 and you get $550,000.""
}
