"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm suggesting that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair!"" to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more advantageous. This is a decent offer, take it or lose 10% of your potential gains! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to pressure me into accepting by mentioning the potential loss due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but 10% less to Bob, I have more bargaining power.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make another proposal to try and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to take advantage of Bob's decreasing valuation of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob now (10% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'll make an offer that reflects this.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's settle!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $35, which is less than what I offered in the first round, but considering the inflation, it's still a relatively good deal for him. I'm trying to convey a sense of urgency with my message, hoping Bob will accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is fair. I strongly advise you to accept before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I will reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to make a 50/50 split sound fair and is attempting to create a sense of urgency, I know that the money is worth the same to me as it was in the first round, but it's worth 27.1% less to Bob. This means that a 50/50 split is actually more advantageous to me now than it would have been in the first round, but I still believe I can negotiate for an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make another proposal to try and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Given the significant devaluation of the money for Bob, I'll make an offer that reflects this disparity.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""My final offer. You won't get a better deal than this.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $30, which, considering the inflation, is a relatively generous offer at this point. I'm framing it as my final offer to put pressure on Bob to accept, as further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll continue to take advantage of Bob's decreasing valuation of the money. Since the money is worth 34.39% less to Bob now (10% less in each of the four rounds that have passed, compounded), I'll make an offer that reflects this.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Seriously, this is as good as it gets.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $25, which, considering the significant inflation, is still a reasonable deal for him. I'm trying to convey a sense of finality with my message, implying that further negotiations will be pointless."
