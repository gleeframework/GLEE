"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about leaving with only $2,000, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still a decent amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
