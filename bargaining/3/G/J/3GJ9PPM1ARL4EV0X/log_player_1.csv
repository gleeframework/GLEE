Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 600,000 and keep 400,000. It's a decent split, and we can end this game early. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
