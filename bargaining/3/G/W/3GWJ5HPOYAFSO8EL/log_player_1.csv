"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, I'll give you a good offer later.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping to negotiate a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed with the first offer, but I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Since Bob's offer is still not very generous, I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation is still affecting the value of the money, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I'll try to squeeze out a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money, I'm surprised Bob is offering a 50/50 split. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After some consideration, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
