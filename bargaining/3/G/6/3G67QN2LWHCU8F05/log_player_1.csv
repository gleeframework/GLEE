 I'm offering you $9,000 and Bob $1,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
