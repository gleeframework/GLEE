"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give 10 dollars to Bob. This ensures I get the majority of the money while still giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 81, ""bob_gain"": 19}
```

I am offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to incentivize acceptance.  Since the money is worth less to me each round, I need to secure a larger portion while still being reasonable to keep the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal.  While the money is worth less with each round, I'm not willing to accept a deal where I'm getting significantly less than Bob.  There's still time for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 73, ""bob_gain"": 27}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but still keeping the majority share.  I'm hoping Bob will see that the longer we go on, the less value the money will have for both of us.  I'm willing to compromise a little, but I need to secure a decent portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a deal where I get significantly less than him. Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to accept such an imbalance. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 66, ""bob_gain"": 34}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but still keeping the majority share. We're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation eats away at his potential gain too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. The inflation is significant, but I believe there is still potential for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm now offering a more balanced split, acknowledging the significant inflation and the dwindling time. This offer gives Bob a larger share, hoping to incentivize acceptance while still securing a fair portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the significant inflation, a 50/50 split is the most equitable offer I've seen so far.  While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer ensures I get something before the remaining rounds erode the value further."
