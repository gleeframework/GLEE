"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems fair, as I'm taking the risk of being rejected and potentially losing money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, I am taking a hit on the value of the money in the next round, so I will accept this offer."
