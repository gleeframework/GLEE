Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn! How about this slightly adjusted split? It accounts for the time lost.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's split the difference! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Reasoning: While Alice is getting more desperate (as evidenced by the decreasing value proposition for her), I can still hold out for a better deal.  The rate of devaluation is working heavily in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Okay, how about we split the difference... your way? Time is running out!""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate? Let's compromise! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning:  Alice is getting desperate, offering me my previous offer! The devaluation heavily favors me, and I can push for a better deal still."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose out if this goes on!""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  While the devaluation heavily favors me, I also need to recognize the risk of Alice getting nothing and deciding to spite me. This offer represents a significant gain for me but still gives Alice something. The ""final offer"" stance adds pressure for her to accept."
