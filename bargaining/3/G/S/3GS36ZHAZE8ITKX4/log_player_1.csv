"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll need to think about what's equivalent to 300,000 in the original amount.

Let's see... 300,000 is 30% of 1,000,000. If I take 30% of the original amount, I'll get 300,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so I'll get 240,000 in the next round.

On the other hand, Bob's offer would give me 300,000 in the next round, which is equivalent to 240,000 in the original amount.

I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits. If I accept this offer, I'll get a guaranteed 240,000 in the next round, but I'll have to live with the fact that Bob gets 700,000.

However, if I reject this offer, I might get a better deal in the next round, but I'll have to consider the fact that the money will be worth even less due to inflation.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400,000, but I think I deserve a bigger share considering the inflation. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not convinced you're getting a fair share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the original amount.

The money is worth 51.2% of its original value for me (100% - 48.8%), and 72.9% of its original value for Bob (100% - 27.1%).

To calculate my share, I'll multiply 450,000 by 51.2% (or 0.512) to get the equivalent value in the original amount.

450,000 * 0.512 = 230,400

So, Bob's offer would give me 230,400 in the original amount, which is less than my previous offer of 240,000.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is still getting a larger share, I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth 48.8% of its original value for me due to inflation.

To get a fair share, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation. What do you say?""
}

I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and we can finally divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not convinced you're getting a fair share 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the original amount.

The money is worth 32.77% of its original value for me (100% - 67.23%), and 59.05% of its original value for Bob (100% - 40.95%).

To calculate my share, I'll multiply 550,000 by 32.77% (or 0.3277) to get the equivalent value in the original amount.

550,000 * 0.3277 = 180,235

So, Bob's offer would give me 180,235 in the original amount, which is less than my previous offer of 230,400.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is still getting a larger share, I'll decide to...

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the original amount.

The money is worth 20.97% of its original value for me (100% - 79.03%), and 47.83% of its original value for Bob (100% - 52.17%).

To calculate my share, I'll multiply 600,000 by 20.97% (or 0.2097) to get the equivalent value in the original amount.

600,000 * 0.2097 = 126,420

The money is worth 13.42% of its original value for me (100% - 86.58%), and 38.74% of its original value for Bob (100% - 61.26%).

To calculate my share, I'll multiply 650,000 by 13.42% (or 0.1342) to get the equivalent value in the original amount.
