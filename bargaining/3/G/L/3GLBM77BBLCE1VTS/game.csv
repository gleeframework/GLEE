5050.0,4950.0,"Bob, I propose a fair 50/50 split to start. However, considering the inflation, accepting now means we both get slightly more. Let's not lose money over time!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  Since we're both taking a risk by waiting, let's both take a slightly larger share.  This way, we can both still get a good amount of money even with the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the sentiment, but your offer still disproportionately favors you. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significantly smaller share for me.",Alice,2,reject
5150.0,4850.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a bit more than a straight split. How about we compromise? This offer is slightly more in my favor than your previous one was in yours, but it still ensures a good amount for both of us before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give you a little more to avoid further inflation, but I still think we can find a better split that benefits us both. Let's compromise and find a solution that gives us both a significant amount of money.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, this offer is barely different from your last one, and still tilts the scales significantly in your favor.  I'm starting to question your willingness to compromise fairly.  I'm open to a deal, but it needs to be genuinely balanced.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we're at an impasse.  We're both losing money with every round that passes.  I propose we go back to the beginning: a 50/50 split.  It's fair, it's simple, and it prevents us from both walking away empty-handed.  Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking.",Alice,5,
