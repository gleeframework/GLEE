Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a bit more than a straight split. How about we compromise? This offer is slightly more in my favor than your previous one was in yours, but it still ensures a good amount for both of us before inflation eats away at it further.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're at an impasse.  We're both losing money with every round that passes.  I propose we go back to the beginning: a 50/50 split.  It's fair, it's simple, and it prevents us from both walking away empty-handed.  Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking.
