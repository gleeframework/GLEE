55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand the advantage you have with inflation, but your previous offer was far too low.  Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. This ensures we both walk away with a decent amount.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's go with a 55/45 split in my favor, given the inflation disadvantage you're facing.  It's a fair deal for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now.  Any further attempts to exploit the inflation situation will just waste time and lead to us both losing out.",Alice,5,
