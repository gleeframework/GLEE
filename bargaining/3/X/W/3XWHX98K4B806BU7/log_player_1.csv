"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start with 80/20""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me 80 dollars and Bob 20 dollars. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we split it fairly and I'll start with a generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous, I'll try to be even more generous this time 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than the original 80, so my gain would be 80 * 0.9 = 72 dollars. Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the original 20, so his gain would be 20 * 0.95 = 19 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I was initially looking for a more even split, and this offer is quite skewed towards Bob.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain would be 72 * 0.9 = 64.8 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, trying to find a middle ground between my initial 80/20 offer and Bob's 10/90 offer. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we meet in the middle."
