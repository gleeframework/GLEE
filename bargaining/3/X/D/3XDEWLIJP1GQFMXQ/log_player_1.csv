"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I anticipate Bob's desire to get at least some of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is slightly better for me than my previous proposal, and the inflation makes it less likely that I'll get a better deal in the future."
