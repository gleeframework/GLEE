"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 6000$ from the first round is still worth 6000$, but Bob's 4000$ is now worth 3200$. Bob's offer of 5000$ for me is a better deal than the 4000$ I would have gotten in the first round, but I think I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to take a slightly larger share this time.

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for him than it would have been in the first round. Considering my 6000$ from the first round is still worth 6000$, I think I should take this offer.
