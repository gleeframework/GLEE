"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 285,000 (95% of 300,000).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not go too low, but I also don't want to risk Bob making an even worse offer next round. Let's see...

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. My goal is to get a better deal before the value of the money decreases further.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can both be happy!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 450,000 is worth 383,500 (85.74% of 450,000), considering the cumulative inflation effect.

Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 404,250 (73.27% of 550,000), considering the cumulative inflation effect.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's getting closer to my previous offer. I'll consider it...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect taking a bigger toll, I'll aim to get an even better deal. Here's my next offer:

  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal, Bob!""
