"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is the same as the one I made in Round 1, but with the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not.

After considering the decreased value of the money, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob 45%."
