I'm starting with a strong offer for myself, leaving a small portion for Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept quickly, as the money will be worth less in later rounds. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him, and even though my share is lower, I'm not going to accept it.  I can still make a better offer in the next round, and the longer we wait, the more the money will lose value for Bob!  Let's see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a larger share. The inflation is starting to work in my favor, and I'm hoping Bob will be more inclined to accept a deal before it gets worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better offer than the previous one. While the money is losing value for both of us, a 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances.  I don't want to risk losing any more value, so I'll accept this offer."
