Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offers are getting worse! While I am feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm aiming for a larger share than Bob, considering the inflation only affects him."
