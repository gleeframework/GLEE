Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as I am the one making the first offer. I expect Bob to accept, as he gets something and there is no guarantee of a better offer in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation rate is 10% for me, but 5% for Bob.  This means I'm losing more value than him with each passing round.  Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant improvement from the previous round, and  the risk of rejection in the next round and even lower value is not worth it.  It's time to secure this deal."
