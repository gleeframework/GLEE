"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 3:1 is too generous. I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
