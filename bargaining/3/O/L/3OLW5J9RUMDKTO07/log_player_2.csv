"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting closer to even split. Let's settle this before inflation eats up more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4537 
# Alice gain: 5463

{""bob_gain"": 5200,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a larger share for myself to offset the inflation, but you're not even considering it.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal before we both lose out more. 
# Bob gain: 4314 
# Alice gain: 5686 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but I need to hold firm. While she's feeling the pressure of inflation, I know time is on my side.  She'll be forced to offer a larger share to make a deal worthwhile for her as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm. My offer stands - take it before inflation eats away even more of your potential gains.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly increasing my demand to capitalize on Alice's increasingly desperate position.  She's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and knows that delaying further will only benefit me.  This offer, while still favoring me, might be tempting enough for her to accept and avoid further losses."
