I'm going to start by being generous to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end this quickly.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is getting greedy! I'm not going to accept such a low offer. Let's see if he'll come back with something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share, but I'm still willing to be reasonable."
