Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is too far. How about 60/40? We both get a decent share, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
