"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair split. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth less. I'd like to get a bigger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
