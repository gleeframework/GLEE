"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, while I take $6000, which is 60%. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair and reasonable,"" indicating that I believe this division is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. This offer still gives you a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob's offer gives me $4500, which is less than what I initially offered him, and considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, I will reject this offer. I believe I can negotiate for a better share in the next round.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the decrease in value due to inflation, my new offer will take into account the current value of the money. I'll propose a division that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer but still gives me a larger share.\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
