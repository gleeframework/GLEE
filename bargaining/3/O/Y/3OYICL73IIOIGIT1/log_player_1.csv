"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, knowing that the value will decline for me with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept the offer.  While the inflation has made the money worth less for me, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome given that I had proposed a much larger share for myself in the previous round."
