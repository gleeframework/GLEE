"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money (9000$) while still giving Bob a small amount (1000$). It's a strong offer for Alice in the first round as it allows her to keep the majority of the money while still potentially leaving room for negotiation later."
