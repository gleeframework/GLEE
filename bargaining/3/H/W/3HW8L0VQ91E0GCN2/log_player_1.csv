"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. I'd rather not accept a 60/40 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
