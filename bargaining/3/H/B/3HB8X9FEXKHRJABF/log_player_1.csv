"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, I'm open to negotiations later""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm hoping this is a good starting point, but I'm also leaving the door open for negotiations in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to make a concession. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than this, so I'll reject the offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60, which is a 10% increase from Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping this is a more reasonable compromise that Bob will accept."
