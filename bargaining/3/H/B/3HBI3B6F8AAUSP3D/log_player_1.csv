"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a higher percentage of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'd rather get a higher percentage of the remaining amount. A 50/50 split is a fair offer considering the reduced value of the money.
