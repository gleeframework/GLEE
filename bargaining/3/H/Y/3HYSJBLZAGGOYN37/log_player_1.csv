"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but I think we can both do better than a 65/35 split. Let's try a 60/40 split, which gives me a slight advantage now, but will be more equal for you in the long run with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
