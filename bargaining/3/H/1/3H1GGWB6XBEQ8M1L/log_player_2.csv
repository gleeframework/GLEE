"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5238,
""alice_gain"": 4762,
""message"": ""My turn! Let's settle this quickly. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me than your previous offer, considering the time-value of money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. Let's be fair and split it evenly. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution.  With inflation increasing, it's better to take a sure thing. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
