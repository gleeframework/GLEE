Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, accepting is the best choice here.  If I reject, the next round will see my share shrink even further, and I risk getting nothing. It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all."
