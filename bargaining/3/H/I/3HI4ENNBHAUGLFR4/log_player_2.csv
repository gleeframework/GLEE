"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly larger share 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Alice's share is much higher, and even though the value of the money decreases with each round, I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, considering our different inflation rates. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering my reduced gains due to inflation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice is taking a larger share, her offer still leaves me with a significant gain. It's better than continuing to negotiate and risking further inflation eroding my potential earnings."
