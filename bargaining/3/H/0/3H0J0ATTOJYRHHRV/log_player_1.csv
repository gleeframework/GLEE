"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, as the inflation will quickly erode the value of the remaining funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant sum of money.  The inflation rate is too high to risk waiting for another round."
