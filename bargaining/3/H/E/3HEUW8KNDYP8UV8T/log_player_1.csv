Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. We both get a decent share, and it's better to settle now than to lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about the inflation, his offer is getting worse for me with each round.  I need to hold out for a better deal.  The longer I wait, the more desperate Bob will become, and the more likely he is to offer a larger share to ensure we both get something."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, so I need a slightly bigger share to make up for it. This is still a fair offer, considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is correct about inflation hitting him harder, but he's still trying to secure a better share than I am getting.  The longer this goes on, the more his initial advantage diminishes. I need to hold firm and aim for a better split, even if it means waiting a little longer."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I'm trying to find a balance that still gives you a substantial amount while considering my own losses. Let's settle on this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is getting very tight, but Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation on his end. He's trying to frame his offer sympathetically, but it's still a worse deal than he initially offered. There are only a few rounds left, and I'm betting he'll crack and offer a more even split before we both get nothing."
