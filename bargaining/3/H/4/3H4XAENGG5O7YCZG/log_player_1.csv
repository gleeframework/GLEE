"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll adjust my offer to account for the reduced value of the money. I'll propose a slightly lower amount for myself, but still try to get a decent share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 3500, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really taking a toll on the value of the money. With the reduced value, my gain of $3500 is now worth only 35.6% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $6500 is worth 54.9% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm not eager to give up either. I'll think carefully about this offer and... reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the reduced purchasing power. I'll propose a slightly higher amount for myself to try to make up for the lost value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve a better deal. This is my final offer.""
