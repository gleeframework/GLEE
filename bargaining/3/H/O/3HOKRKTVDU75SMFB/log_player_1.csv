"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split.  I want to maximize my share in the first round before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer than risk further inflation. The decrease in value is significant enough that I might not get a better deal in the next round."
