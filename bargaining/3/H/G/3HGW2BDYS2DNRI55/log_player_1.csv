"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual values are:
Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000
Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for a new proposal!

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in each of the two previous rounds), the actual value is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times the original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values for Bob's offer in this round:

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual value is 0.7289 times the original value (1 - 0.271 = 0.729, but since we're considering the value from the previous round, we multiply by 0.9 first and then multiply by 0.729).

The actual values are:
Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.7289 = 327,405
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.7289 = 400,295

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to...
