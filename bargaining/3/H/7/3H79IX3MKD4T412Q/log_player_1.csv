I propose to take $999,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I think this is a fair starting offer, given that I will be losing 0% of my money each round, while he will lose 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still try to leave Bob with a decent amount to incentivize him to accept. Since he's losing 10% of his value each round, it's important to keep him engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a larger share. Even though Bob is losing value at a faster rate, his offer is not attractive enough for me to accept at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but not too drastically. I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring Bob doesn't completely walk away from the negotiation. I'm hoping that he sees the increasing value of his share, despite the inflation, and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is improving, but it's still not enough for me to accept. I need to secure a larger share to maximize my gains. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob. While I'm not seeing significant movement from Bob yet, I'm hoping that the continued inflation will push him to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
