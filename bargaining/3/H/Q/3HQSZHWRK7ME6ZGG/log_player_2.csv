"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to take a smaller share to get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round.\n###\n\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation.""}\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting us both, so let's split this evenly. It's the fairest way forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\nGiven the impact of inflation on both of our gains, an even split seems like the most reasonable offer at this point. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n###\n\n\nYour turn!"
