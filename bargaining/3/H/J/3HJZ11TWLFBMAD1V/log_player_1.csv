Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer is the safest move at this point. 

* **Inflation:**  Both our potential gains are diminishing quickly. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems to be aiming for a slightly advantageous split. Waiting might force me to accept an even less favorable deal later.  
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, while rejecting risks getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
