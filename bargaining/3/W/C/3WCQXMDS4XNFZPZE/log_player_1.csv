"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my offer was rejected, I need to consider the impact of inflation.  
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly less than what I offered, but it's still a good deal considering the inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer risks getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
