I'm going for a very aggressive first offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Since this is the first round, I believe I have the upper hand.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than my initial proposal, it's still not favorable enough considering the inflation.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can negotiate a better deal.  I'll focus on trying to leverage the inflation to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise this time, taking into account the inflation that has affected both of us.  I'm offering Bob 3000, which is still less than his previous offer of 4000, but more than the 1000 he received in the first round.  This should be appealing to him as he's also facing inflation. Hopefully, this will be enough to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential earnings, and Bob's offer is definitely not what I was hoping for. However,  I'm worried that if I reject this, Bob will be able to take an even larger share in the next round due to the continued inflation.   It's a difficult decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  At least it's better than nothing."
