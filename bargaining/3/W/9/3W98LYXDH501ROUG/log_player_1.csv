"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, and Bob's gain of $55 is worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a slightly better deal than I am, considering the inflation. However, it's still a relatively close split. I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, and considering the previous offer from Bob, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $52 is worth 73.9% of what it would have been in the first round, and Bob's gain of $48 is worth 96.74% of what it would have been in the first round.

Considering the previous offers and the inflation, I think this offer is a relatively fair one. I'll decide to...
