Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division for both of us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both get a chance to propose. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous.""
}
```

I've taken into account that the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less in each of the two rounds), so I'm trying to get a bit more to compensate for that. Let's see how Bob responds!"
