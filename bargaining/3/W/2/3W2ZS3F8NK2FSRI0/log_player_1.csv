Let's see if Bob is happy with just a dollar!  I'm feeling generous today, but I'm also aware that every round, the value of money decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to let Bob get away with that! One dollar is not a fair deal, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what Bob proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to try offering Bob a bit more this time, but I'm still holding onto the majority.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I want to finalize this before we both lose too much!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, Bob's offer is getting better.  While the inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me,  I don't want to risk him getting even more stubborn and us losing more money in the next round.  I'll accept this offer, but I'm definitely going to make sure I get a good deal next time!"
