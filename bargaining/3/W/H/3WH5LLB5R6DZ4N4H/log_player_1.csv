"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a 50/50 split. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to take a 20% hit on my gain, so the effective amount I'd get is $4,000 (5000 x 0.8).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there, Bob. I'd rather have a slightly larger share. Let's negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split and hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing again!

Considering the new inflation rates, I'll make a new offer. I'll take 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,500 (5500 x 0.8, considering the 20% inflation). Bob will get $4,500 (4500 x 0.9, considering the 10% inflation).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time. You'll get a decent amount too!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. You'll still get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new inflation rates, I'll have to adjust my thinking. My effective gain would be $2,624 (5200 x 0.5, considering the 50% effective discount from the original value).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. I think this is a fair deal. I'll take it!""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer and we can finally settle on a division of the money!"
