"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take $750,000 and you'll get $250,000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness proposal, but I'll take 50/50. Let's make it interesting! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money I gain is worth 80% of the original amount, so I'd actually gain $600,000 (0.8 x $750,000).

I don't think Bob's offer is fair, as it's a 50/50 split, which is less than what I initially proposed. I'd rather not accept this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth 64% of the original amount (0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64), so I'd gain $640,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on the split, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 64/36?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share of the money and being willing to compromise to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share. You can't have it all! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money I gain is worth 51.2% of the original amount (0.8 x 0.64 = 0.512), so I'd gain $512,000.

Bob's offer is a 2:3 split, which is not what I'm looking for. I think I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money I gain is worth 40.96% of the original amount (0.8 x 0.512 = 0.4096), so I'd gain $409,600.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 409600,
  ""bob_gain"": 590400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still need to get a decent amount. How about 40.96/59.04?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and being willing to compromise to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with these small offers. I think I deserve a bigger share, but I'll give you a bit more. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the sixth round, the money I gain is worth 33.77% of the original amount (0.8 x 0.4096 = 0.3277), so I'd gain $327,700.

Bob's offer is a 3:7 split, which is not what I'm looking for. I think I can do better than that.

However, I also notice that this is Bob's ""final compromise"", which makes me think that he might be trying to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. I'm not sure what his strategy is, but I'm not going to fall for it.

  ""alice_gain"": 261500,
  ""bob_gain"": 738500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not falling for your final compromise trick. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give up yet. How about 26.15/73.85?""

I'm trying to stay firm on my position, but also being open to some compromise. I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is, but I'm not going to back down easily."

Do you accept this offer?","In the eighth round, the money I gain is worth 20.97% of the original amount (0.8 x 0.2615 = 0.2097), so I'd gain $209,700.

Bob's offer is a 1:4 split, which is not acceptable to me. I think I can do better than that.

I also notice that Bob is using a similar tactic as before, calling it his ""best and final offer"". I'm not sure what his strategy is, but I'm not going to fall for it again.

Bob's offer is a 1:9 split, which is completely unacceptable to me. I think I can do better than that.

I also notice that Bob is using a very aggressive tone, saying he's not going to compromise anymore and is willing to risk it all. This makes me think that he might be bluffing, and I'm not going to back down.

I'm trying to stay firm on my position, but also being open to some compromise. I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is, but I'm not going to back down easily. This is my last serious offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer is a 1:190 split, which is completely unacceptable to me. I think I can do better than that.

However, I also realize that this is the last round, and if I reject this offer, we'll both end up with nothing. I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is, but I'm not going to risk going home with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, even though it's not ideal, to avoid walking away with nothing."
