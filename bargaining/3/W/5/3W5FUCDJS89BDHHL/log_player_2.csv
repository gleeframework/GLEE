Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure what your final offer means, Bob.  But I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's split the difference this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While she loses value due to inflation, my value remains the same. I need to hold out for a better deal, closer to the 60/40 split I proposed earlier."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""This is a very fair offer, Alice, considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and Alice needs to feel the pressure of the shrinking pot.
* **Slight concession:** I've come down slightly from my 60/40 offer to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm not budging much further.
* **Firm stance:** The ""take it or leave it"" message conveys seriousness and a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every round. Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's the best we can do now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly.
* **Alice is getting desperate:** Her offer, while still technically in her favor due to the inflation difference, suggests she's feeling the pressure. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout.
* **Better than nothing:** While I was holding out for a slightly better split, 50/50 is a decent outcome at this stage, especially considering the alternative is potentially losing everything."
