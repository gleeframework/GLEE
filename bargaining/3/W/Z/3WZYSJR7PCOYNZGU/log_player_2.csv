Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting desperate, but I'll only go down a bit 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting $43 is a terrible outcome for Bob.  He needs to hold firm, even if it means risking getting $0. Alice will likely become more reasonable in the next few rounds as the deadline approaches."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Okay, here's a compromise. I'm willing to accept slightly less than half to end this. Let's be sensible - inflation is hurting both of us now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll only go down a tiny bit, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, and the pressure is on. However, accepting $44 at this stage would be a significant loss for Bob due to the accumulated inflation. Alice is clearly trying to wear Bob down, but there's still a chance she'll make a more reasonable offer in the remaining rounds as the risk of getting nothing increases."

{
""bob_gain"": 47,

""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of your greed.  Meet me in the middle, or we both get nothing. This is my final offer.""
