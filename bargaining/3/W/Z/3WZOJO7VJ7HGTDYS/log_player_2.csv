"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%. This ensures we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept something rather than nothing,  it's better to see what Alice's counter-offer is.  There's a chance she'll be more willing to compromise in the next round, especially if she doesn't know about the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to divide the money.""}
