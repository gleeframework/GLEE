"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice.  No need for complications. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to simplify things.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better than a 50-50 split, considering I'm getting the same amount of money as in the first round, but the value of Bob's share is decreasing with each round. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being open to negotiation."
