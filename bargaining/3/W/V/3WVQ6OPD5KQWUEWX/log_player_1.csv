Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. This is more balanced considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking another hit from inflation.  This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob. His share is decreasing at twice the rate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in Round 5 is risky. There's no guarantee Bob will offer more, and even if he does, the gains might be negligible after accounting for inflation.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's message indicates increasing frustration. He might become even more aggressive in future rounds, potentially offering even less favorable terms.

Accepting the current offer cuts our losses and ends the game with a reasonable, albeit not perfect, outcome."
