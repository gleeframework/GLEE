"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss more in the next round if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, I'm offering an equal split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

I accept Bob's offer.
