I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems fair as I'm taking the risk of proposing first."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm decreasing my share slightly to 80% but still keeping a large majority. The inflation rate is starting to hurt, so I need to secure a good share while I can."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is better than the previous round, it's still less than what I can potentially get with a few more rounds. The inflation is a big factor, but I'm willing to gamble for a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm lowering my share again, but still maintaining a significant majority. The inflation is getting serious, and I need to secure a decent amount before it eats away at my gains completely."

# Bob gain: 700000

While the offer is significantly better than the previous round, the inflation is hitting hard, and I believe I can still get a better deal if I continue playing.  I'm still aiming for a larger share."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share once more, but still aiming for a majority share. The inflation is a serious threat, but I believe a 60/40 split is a good balance between security and potential for a better deal in the future."
