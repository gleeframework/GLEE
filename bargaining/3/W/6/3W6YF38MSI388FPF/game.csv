650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I propose we start with a reasonable split where I take $650,000 and you take $350,000.  This gives us both a good chunk of the money upfront. Consider that the value decreases quickly with each round, so starting strong benefits us both.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can both do better.  I propose a split that's more equitable for us both. I'll take $600,000, and you take $400,000. This way we both get a good chunk, and we avoid the risk of losing more money with each passing round.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand you want a fair share, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from our previous offers: I'll take $550,000, and you get $450,000. This ensures we both walk away with a significant amount, and it avoids further losses from inflation. Time is literally money in this game.",Alice,3,
