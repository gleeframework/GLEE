"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, I propose we start with a reasonable split where I take $650,000 and you take $350,000.  This gives us both a good chunk of the money upfront. Consider that the value decreases quickly with each round, so starting strong benefits us both.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  A 65/35 split is heavily in Alice's favor, but it's not an outrageous offer that Bob would immediately reject. It gives Alice a strong negotiating position.
* **Emphasis on Time Value:** By highlighting the rapid devaluation of the money, Alice incentivizes Bob to consider a deal now rather than risk getting a smaller share later. 
* **Apparent Reasonableness:** The message attempts to frame the offer as ""reasonable"" and beneficial to both parties. This can make Bob more receptive, even if the split is uneven."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can both do better.  I propose a split that's more equitable for us both. I'll take $600,000, and you take $400,000. This way we both get a good chunk, and we avoid the risk of losing more money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than his potential gain in Round 1, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor. While the money is losing value, Alice is in a better position to negotiate.  She needs to push Bob closer to a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a fair share, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from our previous offers: I'll take $550,000, and you get $450,000. This ensures we both walk away with a significant amount, and it avoids further losses from inflation. Time is literally money in this game.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Alice is moving closer to a 50/50 split, but not completely. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing her own gain.
* **Splitting the Difference Tactic:**  By suggesting a split that's directly in the middle of their previous offers, Alice presents it as a fair compromise and potentially more palatable to Bob.
* **Continued Emphasis on Time Pressure:**  The reminder about inflation reinforces the need for a decision soon, potentially swaying Bob to accept a deal."
