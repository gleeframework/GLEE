I'm still going to reject this offer. I need to hold out for a better deal to offset the inflation. I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Alice, but I'm betting I can still negotiate a more favorable split."

Alice is getting desperate, and with the inflation hitting hard, I'm willing to accept this offer.  It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing."
