"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob will get 10%, which is $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm still confident I can do better next time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $300,000, which is worth 30% less than the initial $900,000 I proposed in Round 1. Meanwhile, Bob will get $700,000, which is worth 5% less than the initial $100,000 he proposed in Round 1.

I'll think carefully about this offer... 

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Take 30% and I'll take 70%. What do you think?""
}
```

In this offer, I'll take 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob will get 30%, which is $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this round, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll receive if I accept this offer:

Alice's gain: $450,000
Bob's gain: $550,000

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power. However, the inflation rates are different for Alice and Bob, so I'll need to calculate the effective value of the money for each of us.

For Alice, the money is worth 48.8% less than the initial $900,000, so the effective value is $900,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $462,000.

For Bob, the money is worth 14.26% less than the initial $100,000, so the effective value is $100,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $85,714.

Considering these values, I'll have $450,000, which is worth $462,000 in effective value, and Bob will get $550,000, which is worth $85,714 in effective value.

I'll think carefully about this offer... 

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway this time. Take 45% and I'll take 55%. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

In this offer, I'll take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and Bob will get 45%, which is $450,000."
