"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the smaller share if you want to play on""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm also sending a message to Bob, suggesting that we split the money 60-40, but making it clear that I'm willing to accept a smaller share if he wants to continue playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent chunk. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in Round 2, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $2,700.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, so my gain is worth 20% less than $6,000, which is $4,800.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the bigger share this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500, leaving $5,500 for Bob. I'm also sending a message to Bob, hinting that I'm not going to be as generous as I was in Round 1."
