"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both walk away with a nice chunk of change!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but it's a straightforward split and we can both get something out of it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob this round, his gain of $700,000 is actually equivalent to $630,000 in the first round's value. That's a pretty significant difference from the $1,000,000 I initially proposed.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more than I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and we can both get a decent share of the money. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and give Bob a slightly smaller share than I initially proposed, while still keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob each round, and this is the 4th round, the money he gains is worth 10% * 4 = 40% less than in the first round. So, his gain of $550,000 is equivalent to $550,000 / 0.6 = $916,667 in the first round's value.

I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than the previous ones, but I still think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a fair split. I'm willing to give you a bit more this round, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the money evenly. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, and the money he's gaining is worth less and less each round. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob each round, and this is the 6th round, the money he gains is worth 10% * 6 = 60% less than in the first round. So, his gain of $500,000 is equivalent to $500,000 / 0.4 = $1,250,000 in the first round's value.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, and I think it's a good opportunity to take a fair share of the money. I'll accept his offer.
