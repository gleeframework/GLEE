"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent share too! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my gain of $40 is actually worth $36.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the money, but it's a decent offer considering the situation. I'll accept this offer for now.
