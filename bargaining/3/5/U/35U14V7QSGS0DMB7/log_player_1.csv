"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a slightly larger share now to compensate for the decreasing value of money. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is still a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
