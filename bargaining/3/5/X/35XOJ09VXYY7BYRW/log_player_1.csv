"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, trying to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of 150,000 is actually worth $135,000 (90% of 150,000).

I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of money, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the current value of $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%. The message is a friendly one, trying to find a mutually acceptable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth $292,000 (72.9% of 400,000).

I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I'm willing to accept Bob's offer since it's a compromise.
