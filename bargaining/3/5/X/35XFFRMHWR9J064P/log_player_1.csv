"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with a fair split, but I think I can do better. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. I'll have to be more careful with my next offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Think about it.""
}
```

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, taking a smaller share for myself and giving Bob a larger share. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about a fair split. I'll try to drive the point home. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With the money worth 14.26% less for me, I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's call it a draw.""
}
```

I'm trying to make a more balanced offer, giving Bob a 50/50 split. This way, we can both get a decent share of the money, considering the effects of inflation."
