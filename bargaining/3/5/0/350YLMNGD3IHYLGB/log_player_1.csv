"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing, I'll take a slightly better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my initial offer so quickly!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully about it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. This means that Bob's offer is actually a better deal for him than my initial offer, but not as good as the 50/50 split I proposed.

However, since Bob claims I was ""lowballing"" and this offer is a ""slightly better deal"", I'll try to negotiate a bit further. I'll reject this offer and hope to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself, but still leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight improvement, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still a bit too high, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the new offer from Bob. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation, but Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. This is a significant decrease in value for Bob.

Considering the offer, I notice that Bob is now proposing a 45/55 split, which is a compromise from his previous offer. I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me, but I'm willing to consider it.

However, I'll make a small counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the significant decrease in value of Bob's gain due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself, but still leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not giving up!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the new offer from Bob. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation, but Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. This is a significant decrease in value for Bob.

However, Bob is now proposing the same offer he made in Round 2, which I rejected earlier. I'm not sure if he's trying to trick me into accepting an offer I already rejected, or if he genuinely thinks I'll accept it now.

Considering the significant decrease in value of Bob's gain, I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the significant decrease in value of Bob's gain due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

I'll propose a deal that's even more favorable to myself, given the circumstances.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split!""
