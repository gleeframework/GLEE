"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation that affects you more heavily. Let's see if we can agree on this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think a 60/40 split is fair now? I think you're trying to take advantage of the situation!""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, and I'm not convinced by Bob's argument. It's still not a good deal for me. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new offer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up much more than the original 60/40 split. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not giving up much more than the original proposal. Your turn, Bob!"
