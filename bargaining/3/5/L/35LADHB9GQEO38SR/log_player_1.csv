"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to stick with the 60-40 split, but now he's proposing that I get the smaller share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in taking the smaller share, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
