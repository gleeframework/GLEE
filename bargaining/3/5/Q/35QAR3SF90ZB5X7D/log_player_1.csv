"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I can do better than that. This is my opening offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a bigger share, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I'm willing to give up.""
}
```

I'm offering a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still reasonable considering the current state of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said you were willing to meet me halfway, but I think you can do a bit better than that. This is my revised offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more from me. Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less now, I'm not too keen on giving up 60% of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my previous offer, but I'm willing to make some adjustments in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more than 55% of the remaining amount. Let's meet in the middle, Bob.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my initial offer, but still gives Bob a decent share."
