"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it. I'll be getting the most of the money while still offering him a small amount to hopefully entice him to accept. It's risky, but if he rejects, the inflation will start impacting my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000, which is still a significant amount.  The inflation is starting to take effect, and rejecting this offer risks a much lower payout in future rounds. A 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise considering the inflation."
