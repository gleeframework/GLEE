"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm being generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this proposal and ending the game quickly to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need to look out for myself too.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into our money, let's split it and be done""
}


I've reduced my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation, but still hoping to come out with a larger share. I'm emphasizing the urgency of the situation to try to persuade Bob to accept."
