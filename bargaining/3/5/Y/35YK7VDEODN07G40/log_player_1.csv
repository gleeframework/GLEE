"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer gives Bob a small amount, hoping to incentivize him to accept in the first round. As the rounds go on, the value of the money will decrease, making it less attractive for Bob to reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a good deal for me considering the inflation.  While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking the potential of getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
