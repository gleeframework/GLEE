I'm starting with a more balanced proposal, hoping to secure a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving up yet.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation is getting worse, so I need to be more assertive.  Hopefully, this shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a fair share."
