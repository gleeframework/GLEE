Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking!  I'm not going to let the value of the money completely disappear. Let's make a deal now. I'm offering 70/30, which is a fair compromise given the current inflation. We're both losing a lot, let's take what we can get. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hurting Bob significantly, but Alice seems insistent on maintaining a very favorable split.  While risky, rejecting this offer and proposing a more aggressive split might be Bob's only chance to secure a reasonable amount before the inflation makes the deal worthless."
