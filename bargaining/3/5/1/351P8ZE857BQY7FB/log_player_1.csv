"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I believe fairness will lead to a quicker resolution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is tempting due to its simplicity and seeming fairness, it doesn't factor in the inflation working against me. Accepting now would mean I lose out on potential gains if I play strategically in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 548750,
""bob_gain"": 451250,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, literally! I need a slightly better deal to account for the inflation affecting my share. This is a fair compromise.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  I've increased my asking share slightly to offset the 5% inflation I've already experienced.  It's crucial to factor this in with each round.
* **Urgency:** Bob's message in Round 2 suggests he values a quick resolution. By highlighting the time pressure again and making a slightly more appealing offer, I'm hoping he'll be more inclined to accept. 
* **Balance:** I don't want to appear too greedy, so I'm still offering a deal where Bob gains a significant sum. The goal is to find a balance between maximizing my gains and securing an agreement before the money devalues significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to get this over with. Let's be practical and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally acknowledging the time pressure, but his offer is still not favorable to me. While he's offering slightly more than a 50/50 split, it doesn't compensate for the 14.26% inflation I've already experienced.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 570375,
""bob_gain"": 429625,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. This offer reflects the value lost due to the passing time. Let's wrap this up and both walk away with a good deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Urgency:** We're now past the halfway point.  The compounding inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains.  My offer reflects this urgency.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob increased his offer in the last round, signaling his willingness to adjust.  My offer meets him halfway between his previous offer and my last one. It's a strong signal that I'm aiming for a fair resolution, but not willing to be taken advantage of.
* **Strong Justification:** I'm continuing to remind Bob of the lost value due to time.  This emphasizes that my offer isn't just about maximizing my share, but about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement before the ""pie"" gets much smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting tired of this game. This is my final offer. We need to end this and avoid further losses.  Let's be realistic and accept this compromise. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Bob is clearly drawing a line in the sand. Rejecting this offer carries a high risk that he'll offer even less favorable terms in subsequent rounds, or even walk away entirely.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The inflation is steadily eroding my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting now guarantees me a reasonable sum. Holding out for a marginally better deal in later rounds might not be worth the risk of getting even less, or nothing at all.
* **Practicality:**  Bob is right, this back-and-forth is not productive.  It's time to be pragmatic. Accepting this offer allows me to walk away with a significant sum, even if it's not the absolute maximum I could have gotten."
