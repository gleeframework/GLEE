Alice's offer:

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than your last offer. This division is more fair, considering the decreasing value of money.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose a division of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This aims to be a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the offer,  considering the shrinking value of the money and the potential for even less in the next round."
