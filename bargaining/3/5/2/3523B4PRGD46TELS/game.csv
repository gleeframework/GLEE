6000.0,4000.0,Fair 60-40 split. Let's be reasonable!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your 60-40 split seems a bit too tilted in your favor. How about we meet closer to the middle with a 55-45 split?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"I can meet you closer to the middle, but 55-45 is still a bit too far. How about 58-42?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"This is getting us nowhere fast.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer, but time is running out and the value is shrinking.  53-47?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5700.0,4300.0,I see we're both willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at 57-43. This is as low as I'm willing to go.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be real. The clock is ticking, and the value is dropping fast for you. I'm offering a straight 50-50 split. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes any further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,accept
