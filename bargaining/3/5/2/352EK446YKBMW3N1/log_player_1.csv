"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I want to maximize my gain. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll consider it.

After some thought, I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll try to do better than that!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still hoping he'll accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! I need to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth significantly less than in the first round, I want to maximize my gain. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk rejecting it and getting an even worse deal in the next round.

After some thought, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
