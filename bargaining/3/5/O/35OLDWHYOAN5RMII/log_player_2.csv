# Alice's message: You said that was your last offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, knowing that inflation hurts me more than her. While my offer in Round 4 was a bluff, I need to start being realistic. I'll aim for a slightly better split in the next round, but be prepared to concede a bit more as the rounds progress."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers, now I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but I'm going to hold out a little longer. Alice is clearly enjoying her advantageous position. While she claims to be ""generous"", she's still taking a significant chunk of the money. The inflation is hurting, but I'm hoping she'll crack under the pressure of potentially losing everything. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't great, it's better than what I might get in the remaining rounds, especially if Alice continues to chip away at my share.  It's time to cut my losses and take the deal."
