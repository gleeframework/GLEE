Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a small loss to avoid further inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Although I was hoping for a better deal, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to take a small loss to avoid further inflation, and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent offer. Plus, the money is still worth the same for me, so I'll take the 48 dollars and end the game here."
