"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking $900,000 for myself, and giving $100,000 to Bob. This gives him a small amount, but it is a starting point for negotiation, and I hope to get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 850,000 for myself and 150,000 for Bob.  This reflects the inflation and gives Bob a better deal than the last round, but still leaves me with the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is significant at this point.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a gain of 150,000, which is still better than what I would get if I continue to reject offers.  I don't see a better outcome for myself in the following rounds."
