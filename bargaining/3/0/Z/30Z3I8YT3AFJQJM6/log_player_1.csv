Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's a good idea to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the total, especially since the money is worth less than before. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."

# Alice gain: 10

# Alice gain: 5

This offer is extremely unfair, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share of the money. I think Bob can do better than this. I'll try to negotiate again.

# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is completely unacceptable. I'm not willing to accept a share as small as 2 dollars out of 100. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the time pressure and the inflation. I'll try to negotiate again.

I'm getting worried that we might not be able to divide the money fairly, but I'm not willing to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take almost all, it's getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is ridiculous. I'm not willing to accept a share as small as 1 dollar out of 100. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the desperation and the inflation. I'll try to negotiate again.

I'm running out of options, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll try to make one more offer to see if Bob will compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

# Bob's message: I'll take almost all, it's the last chance 
# Alice gain: 0.5 
# Bob gain: 99.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a share as small as 0.5 dollars out of 100. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the desperation and the inflation. I've tried to negotiate and compromise, but it seems like Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway.

Since I've reached the 12th round and Bob's offer is still unacceptable, I'm forced to reject it."
