"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a reasonable and generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do a little better than that. How about a 52/48 split? 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{ ""decision"": ""reject"" }"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""
}
```

I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go as low as 48% for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway between our previous offers. Keep in mind that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and another 20% less than in the second round, so we should try to come to an agreement soon!"
