"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I think we can do a little better than that. How about a 52/48 split?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** It's crucial to reach a deal quickly. The longer we wait, the less the $10,000 will be worth.
* **Fairness:** While I want to maximize my gain, I recognize Alice needs an incentive to accept. A 52/48 split is a slight improvement for me over her initial 60/40 offer, making it more likely she'll accept. 
* **Future Rounds:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be in a weaker position in the next round as the money will be worth even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. It's getting risky to hold out for a better deal.
* **Alice's Position:** Her offer reflects a compromise, moving closer to the middle ground. She's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer in hopes of a slightly better deal in the next round is too risky.  The potential loss from further inflation outweighs the potential gain."
