Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer as it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm accepting this offer. Bob's counteroffer is still reasonably generous, and with inflation, the value of the money will continue to decline. It's better to secure some of the money now than risk getting nothing later."
