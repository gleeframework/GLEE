  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50 to start, and then we can reassess in the next round.""

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share this round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better in the next round, and I don't want to give up too much value upfront. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to maintain his control over the majority of the money, even as the value of the money he gains is decreasing due to inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the gap between our shares is becoming too large, and I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split. I'll try to negotiate a more balanced split in the next round."

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the token of goodwill is not enough to compensate for the large disparity in our shares.

# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a very strong move this round, and his offer is becoming increasingly one-sided. The value of the money he gains is worth very little compared to the value of the money I gain. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
