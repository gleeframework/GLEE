"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money, Bob. A 60/40 split seems fair to me for starting the negotiations.  
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With a 20% decrease in value each round, I'm hoping to get a better offer from Alice or make a counteroffer that benefits me more. The initial 60/40 split doesn't seem fair enough for me to accept right away. Let's proceed and see how the negotiations unfold!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair counteroffer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your offer was a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice has met me in the middle at 55/45, I think this is a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, holding out for a better deal might not be worth the risk of losing even more value. Accepting this offer seems like the best course of action at this point."
