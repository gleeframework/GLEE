"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $300,000 is worth $270,000 in the first round's value. That's still a decent chunk of money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation taking a toll, my offer needs to be more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting hard! My potential gain of $400,000 is worth only $729,000 in the first round's value. That's a significant decrease.

However, I still need to consider the overall value of the offer. Since I'm already in a tough spot, I'll accept this offer to minimize my losses.
