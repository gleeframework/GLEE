Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation, I've lost a substantial amount of value, and further negotiations might not yield a better result. It's better to secure this deal before the money loses even more value.\n###\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\nIt was a good game! I played considering the impact of inflation on my gains, trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and not risking losing too much value due to the increasing inflation with each round. Bob played well too, recognizing the advantage he had due to the inflation not affecting his gains and using that to negotiate. In the end, accepting the offer in round 6 seemed the most reasonable decision given the circumstances."
