"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll aim for a higher share to account for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the value of my gain in this round. The money is worth 90% of its original value in round 2, and then another 72.9% of that value in round 4, so my gain is worth 0.9 * 0.729 = 0.6561 of its original value.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer.
