Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share this time.  I think it's fair, and it avoids further inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is a fair compromise considering the inflation. Accepting now means I get more than the initial 4000, and it avoids the risk of further inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal in the next round."
