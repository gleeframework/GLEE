"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 20 dollars is actually worth 16 dollars in real value.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob 80 dollars, which is a significant amount. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain of 16 dollars is actually worth 12.8 dollars in real value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting!

With the 48.8% inflation, my gain of 10 dollars is actually worth 5.21 dollars in real value.
