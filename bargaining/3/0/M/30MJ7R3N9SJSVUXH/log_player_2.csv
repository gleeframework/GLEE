Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle already 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away at the value any further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant. If I reject this offer and Alice doesn't propose something better in the next round, I risk getting even less than $3900 (in round 1 value). It's a gamble, and at this point, cutting my losses is the more logical choice."
