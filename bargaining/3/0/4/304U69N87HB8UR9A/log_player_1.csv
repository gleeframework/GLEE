I propose a 9000/1000 split. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in getting something rather than waiting and risking getting nothing at all!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  The inflation rate means I'll lose 20% of the value of my potential gains with each passing round.  It's unlikely Bob will offer me more, and rejecting could lead to both of us getting nothing."
