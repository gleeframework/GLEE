"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which is a 4:1 ratio. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's end this round and get the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get more money now than risk waiting and getting even less. I'll accept Bob's offer.
