"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think a 55/45 split is quite skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll offer a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split given the inflation risk""
}
```"
