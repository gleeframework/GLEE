"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm a little greedy.  I want to see if I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially since I know the money loses value each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can agree on that.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split given the inflation risk 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Although I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation is hurting me, and Alice's offer is the same as her initial one. Accepting will save me the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
