Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal, but time is literally money! This is my final offer.

# Alice gain: 520000

```
Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Each round that passes eats significantly into our potential gains. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests this is her final offer, making a better deal unlikely. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement. 

While the offer favors Alice, accepting ensures we at least secure a portion of the money before its value diminishes further."
