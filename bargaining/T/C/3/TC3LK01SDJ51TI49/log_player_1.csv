I'm starting with a pretty generous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as the longer this goes on, the less the money will be worth for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  It's much less than I was initially offering, and while the value is dropping, it's only dropping for me.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but hopefully not by too much. I need to find a balance between getting a decent amount and not risking going too many rounds and losing a significant amount due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really trying to push his luck! Even with inflation, this offer is still significantly less than what I'd initially proposed.  I'll keep trying to find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm still trying to negotiate a decent deal. While inflation hurts, I'm hoping Bob will realize that accepting a fair offer is better than pushing for a deal that will likely lead to a deadlock and both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still way too low, even considering the inflation. I'm determined to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm still offering a fair split, even though the inflation is taking a toll. I hope Bob will finally accept and we can both walk away with something."
