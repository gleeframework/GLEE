Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I'm making the first offer.  This should be a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Since Bob rejected my first offer and then offered a split significantly in his favor, I believe this is a fair compromise."
