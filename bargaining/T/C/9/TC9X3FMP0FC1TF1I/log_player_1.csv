"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. This is a generous offer to start, and I hope it will encourage Bob to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is not ideal, the inflation means that if I reject and make a counteroffer, I will get even less in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
