"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I think this offer is a good one. The money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'm getting $6,000, which is actually $8,000 in the first round's value. Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so he's getting $3,600 in the first round's value.

I'll accept this offer.
