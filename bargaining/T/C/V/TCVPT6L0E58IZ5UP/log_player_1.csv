"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in the second round, I'll consider the proposal in terms of the original value.

The offer is for me to get $6,000 and Bob to get $4,000. Since $6,000 is more than the $5,500 that I would have gotten if the money was worth 20% less in the first round, I'll consider this a good deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
