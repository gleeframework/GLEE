"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair foundation for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, I'll gain 400,000, which is 80% of the 500,000 I could have gained in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob will gain 600,000, which is 120% of the 500,000 he could have gained in the first round.

Given the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was already skewed in his favor due to the inflation, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to reclaim some ground lost due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm still willing to compromise and give you a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, I'll gain 450,000, which is 90% of the 500,000 I could have gained in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob will gain 550,000, which is 110% of the 500,000 he could have gained in the first round.

Given the inflation, I'll have to be cautious. However, since Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his previous offers, I'll decide to accept this offer.
