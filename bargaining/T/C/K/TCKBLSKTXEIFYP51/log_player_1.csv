"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 5% less this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, when the money will be worth even less."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this deal before the money becomes even less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast! I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations even further. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take Bob's offer, as I don't want to risk waiting for a better deal and potentially getting nothing if the game doesn't end soon."
