"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems like a decent amount now, the value will decrease rapidly for me in further rounds. I need to aim for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, Alice. However, the money's value decreases faster for me in the coming rounds.  This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. Let's be practical."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the fairest. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is sticking to a heavily skewed split, even though the value is decreasing significantly for her.  It's clear she's hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches. I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a counter-offer. It's becoming clear that we need a more balanced approach for this to work.  Time is running out for both of us."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but we need to close this deal soon. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but time is becoming a serious factor. Alice seems firm on getting slightly more, and while it's not ideal, accepting now avoids the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12."
