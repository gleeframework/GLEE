"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game. I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, but it's a good strategy in the first round because:

* **Maximize your share:**  I want to keep as much of the money as possible, given the risk of inflation.
* **Minimal risk:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, I get to make a proposal in the next round. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best move. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My potential gains are shrinking rapidly with each round. 
* **Bob's Leverage:** Bob has shown he's willing to play hardball. If I reject this, he might offer even less next round, and I'll be in a worse position. 
* **Guaranteed Share:**  Getting 400,000 is still a significant sum, especially given the risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers. 

It's a gamble, but I think it's worth taking."
