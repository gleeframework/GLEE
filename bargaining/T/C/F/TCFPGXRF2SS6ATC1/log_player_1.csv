"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm effectively getting $38 (40 * 0.95) if I accept this offer. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the previous two rounds), I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decreased value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}"
