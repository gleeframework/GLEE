"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is going down, Bob. Let's settle this now. This is the same deal you offered me, but with the roles reversed.  It seems fair considering it's my turn to propose. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in a future round isn't worth the risk of getting even less later.
* **Fairness:** Alice's offer mirrors Bob's previous proposal. Accepting shows a willingness to compromise and avoids appearing greedy. 

While Bob might prefer a 50/50 split, accepting 45 now is better than risking a worse outcome later due to inflation."
