I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm hoping to get the game over quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept a 45/55 split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll take my chances and see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down a bit to avoid the risk of getting nothing. 800,000 for me is a good outcome considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob is more reasonable this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still think I can get a better deal! While the inflation is biting, I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a 70/30 split.  The inflation is making things harder, but I think I can still get a decent share. This is my last chance to make an offer before Bob takes the lead!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm getting a little nervous with the inflation hitting hard. I'm going to accept Bob's offer. A 55/45 split isn't ideal, but it's better than getting nothing at all. This inflation is a real threat!"
