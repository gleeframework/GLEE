"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% loss, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to adjust my offer. Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's side! I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering that my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the 4% difference in the split. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value.
