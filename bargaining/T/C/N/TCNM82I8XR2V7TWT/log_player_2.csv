"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 100,000$ is a decent amount, it's worth trying to negotiate for a better deal. There's a chance Alice will be willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair. It's a good compromise and allows us both to get a significant portion of the money."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle, Bob. 50/50 is fair and we can both walk away with a decent amount. Inflation is hitting us both, and we don't want to risk losing even more money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer the 55/45 split, Alice is likely aware of the inflation impacting both of us.  Accepting the 50/50 offer is a safe choice, especially considering the risks of continued negotiation."
