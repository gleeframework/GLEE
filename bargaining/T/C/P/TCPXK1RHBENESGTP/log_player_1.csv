"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a more fair starting point, considering we both have to make concessions. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less to me due to inflation, I'm more inclined to accept a slightly more favorable split for Bob.
