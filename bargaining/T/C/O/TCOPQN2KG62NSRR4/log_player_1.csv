I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!  I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

Since inflation is affecting me more than Bob, I'll try to secure a larger share for myself while still being somewhat reasonable.  Let's see if this offer is more appealing to Bob."
