Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on my side, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'm still losing money compared to the initial round, the rate of inflation is significant now. Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my gains in the face of continued devaluation."
