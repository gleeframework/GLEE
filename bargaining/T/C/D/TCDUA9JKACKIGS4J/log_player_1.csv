"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share, but not by too much, in the hopes that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially with the reduced value of money. I'll keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

With the continued effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to concede too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, but I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the significantly reduced value of money, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 35/65 split, especially with the reduced value of money. I'll keep pushing for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my limit."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are getting high!

With the continued erosion of the money's value, I'll make a new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and making a slightly more aggressive proposal, hoping Bob will accept it before the value of the money drops even further."
