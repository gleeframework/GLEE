"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to try to get more than half of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to propose a better split for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get more than half of the money. I'll propose a split where I get 60% of the money, which is worth more to me now than 50% would be in the next round.
### {""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more suitable split.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a fair share too. Let's call it a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 36% less for me now, Alice's offer of 40 is actually worth less than the 50 she offered in the first round. Considering this, I'll reject her offer and try to propose a better split for myself in the next round.
### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less to me now, I need to try to get a larger share to make up for the loss in value. I'll propose a split where I get 70% of the money, which might be more acceptable to Alice since we're running out of rounds.
### {""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Considering the rapidly decreasing value for me, I think this split is necessary.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  Let's meet in the middle and call it a day. This is a reasonable split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 59.04% less for me now, Alice's offer of 30 is actually worth significantly less than any previous offer. However, considering the rapidly decreasing value and the fact that we're running out of rounds, I'll accept her offer to avoid losing even more value in the next round.
### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt's time to settle!"
