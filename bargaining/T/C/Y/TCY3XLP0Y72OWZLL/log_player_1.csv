Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my guns. 50/50 is the only fair option.  Let's stop wasting time and take the deal before inflation eats away any more of our potential winnings. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

It's painful to accept a 50/50 split, but with the inflation rate, waiting any longer will likely result in a worse outcome. Bob seems fixed on the 50/50 split, and we risk getting even less if we continue to refuse."
