"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but 20% less to Bob, I have more negotiating power. Additionally, Bob's offer is not significantly better than my initial offer, so I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Don't let inflation eat away your share""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to 65% and decreasing Bob's share to 35%. The message is a reminder to Bob that with each passing round, his potential gain is worth less due to inflation, so it's in his interest to accept the offer sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both. Let's split evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, no! Inflation is only hurting Bob, not me!

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I know that inflation is only affecting his potential gain, not mine. Splitting evenly would be a bad deal for me, considering I can try to get more in the next round. Bob's message is trying to create a false sense of mutual urgency, but I'm not buying it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Time is on my side, but I'm still willing to share""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to 70% and decreasing Bob's share to 30%. The message is a reminder to Bob that time is working against him due to inflation, and he should consider accepting my offer before his potential gain decreases even further. I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm getting more aggressive with my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Accept this deal or I'm walking. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not intimidated by Bob's threat to walk away. With inflation eating away at his potential gain, I know he has more to lose than I do.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still not good enough for me. Bob's gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, and I'm not willing to meet him halfway. I'm willing to take the risk that Bob will continue to negotiate rather than walk away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Be realistic.""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to 75% and decreasing Bob's share to 25%. The message is a reminder to Bob that time is running out, and he needs to be more realistic about what he can get. With inflation continuing to erode the value of his potential gain, I'm betting that Bob will become more desperate and willing to accept a less favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his ""last chance"" message, I know he's still better off accepting a deal than walking away with nothing. With inflation having reduced the value of his potential gain by nearly 80%, I'm confident that Bob will continue to negotiate rather than risk getting nothing. I'll make another offer and see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""It's time to face reality, Bob. This is my final offer.""}\n\nI'm increasing my share to 80% and decreasing Bob's share to 20%. The message is a firm statement that I'm not willing to negotiate further. With inflation having severely eroded the value of Bob's potential gain, I believe he has no choice but to accept this offer. I'm taking a calculated risk that Bob will realize it's better to get something rather than nothing."
