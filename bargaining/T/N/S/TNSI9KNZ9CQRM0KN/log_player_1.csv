"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a division where I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. Since the money's value decreases with each round, I'm hoping Bob will see the benefit in accepting this offer early on to minimize loss due to inflation. My message to Bob emphasizes fairness but also acknowledges that I'm taking a slightly larger share, setting the stage for potential negotiations in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This round only. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer in this round. Although the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, accepting $45 (which is now worth 20% less) seems less favorable compared to the potential for a better offer in subsequent rounds or making a counteroffer that could result in a more equitable division. Given the differing rates of inflation for each of us, there's strategic value in waiting to see how this affects Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's not waste more value""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer a division where I receive $58 and Bob receives $42. My message to Bob highlights the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the devaluing effect of inflation on our potential gains. By accepting this offer, Bob would secure a significant amount of money before its value decreases further, while I would also benefit from finalizing the deal before the worth of my share diminishes even more. This offer is slightly more favorable to me than the initial one, reflecting the strategic advantage of holding out as the rounds progress and the money's value changes asymmetrically between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating our money! Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept Bob's offer in this round. Given the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation—48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob—accepting an even split now seems more prudent than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Bob's message emphasizes the shared loss we're experiencing due to inflation, and at this point, securing half of the remaining value is preferable to the uncertainty and potential for even greater loss if we continue negotiating. This decision prioritizes mitigating loss over the possibility of achieving a slightly more favorable division in later rounds."
