I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with a decent chunk of the money.  It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping it sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being greedy! While he's offering more than what he was going to get in the first round, this is still a terrible deal for me. I'm not going to let him walk away with 720,000 of the million dollars! I'm going to counter with a fairer offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 40% share. This is significantly more than what he'd get if we keep rejecting each other's offers.  I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair deal, and we can finally reach an agreement before the inflation eats away too much of our potential winnings."
