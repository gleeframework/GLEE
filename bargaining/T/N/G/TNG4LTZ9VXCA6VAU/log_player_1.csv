"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's fair, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd ideally like more than 50%, with inflation, the value of my share is decreasing significantly.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Bob gets something, though it is a fair split."
