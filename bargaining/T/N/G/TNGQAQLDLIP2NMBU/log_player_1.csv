"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the inflation. How about a 55/45 split in your favor? It's closer to your initial offer but gives me a bit more breathing room. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
