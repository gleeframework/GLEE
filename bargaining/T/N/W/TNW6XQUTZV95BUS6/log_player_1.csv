"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and giving me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for himself is not a good deal for me. I'll try to negotiate for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a majority""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me a slightly larger share than before, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer. Although it's not a 50/50 split, the 52/48 split is still a decent compromise. I'm getting a slightly larger share than before, and I'm willing to take it to avoid further negotiation and risk getting a worse deal."
