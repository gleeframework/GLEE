"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, which is a good starting point for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm willing to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to keep a larger share, but I'll consider his offer.

I'll accept this offer for now, as it's better than nothing. I'll get $2,000, which is still a decent amount.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
