"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more this time, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll keep in mind that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than it would have been in the first round. However, since I'm not aware of the exact inflation rate affecting Bob, I'll assume he's taking a slightly larger share to compensate for the uncertainty.

I'm not comfortable with this offer, as it seems slightly biased towards Bob. I'll reject it and propose a new offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to be reasonable too. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a fair balance."
