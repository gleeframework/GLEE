"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair share, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit greedy!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. My gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of the original $500,000 I would have gotten in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of the original $666,666.67 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I don't want to risk going into more rounds. I'll accept this offer to end the game.
