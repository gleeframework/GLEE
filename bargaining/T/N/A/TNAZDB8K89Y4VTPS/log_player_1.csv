"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I'm aiming for a significant portion of the money in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to secure a large share before the value of the money decreases.  This offer gives me 90% of the money and leaves 10% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. My initial offer of 900,000 is now worth 900,000 * 0.95 = 855,000. Accepting Bob's offer of 200,000 is still a better outcome for me than waiting for another round and potentially getting even less."
