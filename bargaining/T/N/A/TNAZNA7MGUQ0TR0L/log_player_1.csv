"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me $60 and Bob $40, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I'd like to get a better deal, especially considering that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55 is a fair amount considering the inflation and the initial offer I made in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in the value of money due to inflation, I think 45 is a reasonable amount for me this round. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances."
