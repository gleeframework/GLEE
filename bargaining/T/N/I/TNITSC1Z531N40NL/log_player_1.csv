"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is slightly more in your favor, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth $6,000, and the money Bob gains is worth $5,250 (95% of $5,500).

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer, as I'm still hoping for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers and the fact that the money is still worth the same for me, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger share, considering the negotiation so far.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $7,000 and leaving $3,000 for Bob. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share this round, but I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise given the inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

* Bob's gain in the first round was $4,000, and with 14.26% inflation, it's now worth $3,441.40.
* My gain is still worth $6,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the inflation. It's better than the previous offers, and I'm willing to take the $4,000."
