"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll give Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is a fair share, and I'll take the rest. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70 is actually worth less than I initially thought. I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 70:30, I'll try to improve my odds by offering a slightly more favorable split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'll offer a 50:50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
