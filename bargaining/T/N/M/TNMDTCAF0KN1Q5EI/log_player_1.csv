Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 80/20 is a fairer split considering we're starting with a large amount. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 80/20, with me taking the larger share. I think this is a fair compromise considering the diminishing value of the money.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 70/30 is a fairer split considering the continued decrease in value due to inflation. I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, it's important to consider the declining value of the money.  The next round will see a further decrease, making this the better option."
