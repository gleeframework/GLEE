"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next proposal. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take its toll!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 20% of the original amount is a small share, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gain!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share to account for the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than the original 60-40 split, but still a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more considering the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 30% of the original amount is a fair share, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and the decreasing value of the money. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering a 36-64 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers, but still a compromise considering the circumstances."
