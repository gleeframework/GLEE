"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping 60%, which is $60. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split, hoping he'll agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more generous offer from my side, but I'm still not willing to accept a 60-40 split. Let's see if you'll do better next time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed a bit more generous, but I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a new offer for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1, so I'll aim for a more even split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the current $100, which is $45, and keeping 55%, which is $55. My message to Bob is to meet me in the middle and split the remaining amount fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 45, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the high end. Will you accept this offer? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns on the 45% gain. I'll consider his revised offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4. I'll take 45% of the current $100, which is $45, and Bob will take 55%, which is $55. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
