"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is the opposite of mine in Round 1, I'm inclined to reject it as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more balanced offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, hoping he'll accept this time."
