"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI offered a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. I also included a message suggesting fairness, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and increase the likelihood of him accepting my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out with inflation.  This offer is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, although he claims it's a compromise considering inflation, the 45-55 split is still not favorable to me, especially since the value of my share decreases with each round. By rejecting, I hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round or put pressure on Bob to reconsider."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I've made a concession. This is as low as I'm willing to go.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've offered a 58-42 split, slightly reducing my share from the initial offer to show that I'm willing to compromise due to the pressure of inflation. The message is firm, indicating that this is the best offer I'm willing to make, in an attempt to persuade Bob to accept before the value of the money decreases further for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer is slightly better for me, but it still gives you a significant share. Let's agree now and avoid losing out further. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, with it now being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. The 49-51 split, although not as favorable as I initially hoped, is better than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds. Accepting now ensures I receive a tangible amount rather than a potentially much lower value if negotiations continue."
