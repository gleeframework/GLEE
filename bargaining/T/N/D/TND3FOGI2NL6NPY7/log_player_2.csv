"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While 10,000$ is a lot of money, I'm not going to be lowballed like that in the first round. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in her favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges your initial advantage, but also recognizes the time pressure we both face. This is a fair offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. Let's make a deal before the value of the money drops further. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing hardball, but her ""final offer"" is still unacceptable. It's clear she's trying to pressure me by emphasizing the declining value, but I'm not going to fold.  A 20/80 split is far too skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this money. To avoid wasting more time and losing value, I propose a simple 50/50 split. This is fair and avoids further risk for both of us.""
