"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8900 
# Bob gain: 1100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation rate means that my gains are already diminishing. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure a decent amount of money and avoid the risk of further losses."
