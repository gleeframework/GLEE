"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 80:20 is a more reasonable split considering the initial offer was 25:75. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
