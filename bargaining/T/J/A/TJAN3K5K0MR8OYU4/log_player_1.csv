"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```
I'm offering to take 70% of the money, which is $70, and leave 30% for Bob, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of $45 is equivalent to $36 in the first round.

I accept the offer:
```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
