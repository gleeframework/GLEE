"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000, which is 60% of the initial amount. I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given I'm the one proposing this time.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is proposing the same split as I did in the first round! I'll consider this offer, but I'm not eager to accept it since I know the money is worth less due to inflation. However, I'll decide to reject this offer since I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you $300,000, but I think I deserve more now. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you rejected my offer, I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  It's a fair counter-proposal, considering the inflation.  Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! My share is worth a lot less now. Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, but I'm also not eager to continue playing and risk losing even more value due to inflation. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
