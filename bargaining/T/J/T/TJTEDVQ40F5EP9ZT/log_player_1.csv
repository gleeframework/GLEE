"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split, heavily in my favor. While I'm willing to share, I want to maximize my gains in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer more, accepting this offer is the best move for me in this round.  The 5% inflation means I'm losing ground, and Bob's 50/50 offer is a fair compromise."
