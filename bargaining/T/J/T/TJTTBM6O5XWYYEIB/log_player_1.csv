"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, let's be more aggressive! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to be aggressive, eh?

Considering the inflation, the money I would gain in this round is worth 10% less than the initial $1,000,000, so it's equivalent to $540,000 in the first round's value. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, equivalent to $380,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better deal than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 40% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets a bit more than 60%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being stubborn!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round's money:

* My gain: $450,000 in this round is worth 72.9% of $600,000 (my original target in round 1), which is equivalent to $437,400 in the first round's value.
* Bob's gain: $550,000 in this round is worth 91.67% of $600,000 (Bob's original target in round 1), which is equivalent to $550,000 in the first round's value.

Considering the inflation, I'm getting a bit closer to my original target, but not quite there. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better deal than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the sweet spot, Bob!""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 49% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets a bit more than 51%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough, I'm taking a firmer stance! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round's money:

* My gain: $400,000 in this round is worth 66.67% of $600,000 (my original target in round 1), which is equivalent to $400,000 in the first round's value.
* Bob's gain: $600,000 in this round is worth 100% of $600,000 (Bob's original target in round 1), which is equivalent to $600,000 in the first round's value.

Considering the inflation, I'm actually getting a worse deal than my original target. I'll have to think carefully...

However, I notice that Bob's gain is exactly the same as his original target in round 1. This might be a sign that he's trying to get back to his original goal. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not...

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 52% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets a bit more than 48%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fine, I'll meet you in the middle... this time. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has finally decided to meet me in the middle!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round's money:

* My gain: $480,000 in this round is worth 80% of $600,000 (my original target in round 1), which is equivalent to $480,000 in the first round's value.
