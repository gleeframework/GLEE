I'll start with a fair 50/50 split.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm not confident I can get a better offer in the next round due to the inflation. I'll take the $45."
