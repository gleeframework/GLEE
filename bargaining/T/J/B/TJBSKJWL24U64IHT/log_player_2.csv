Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's early in the game, and I'm not worried about inflation yet. Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to get a bit more than the initial 50/50 split since I'm the one making the offer this round. I'll offer a slight adjustment, giving myself a bit more but still being somewhat fair to keep the game going.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a more even split. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still want a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is offering me less than what I offered her in the previous round. Considering the inflation, I'm at a disadvantage, but I still have rounds left to negotiate a better deal. I'm hoping to get closer to the 50/50 split or better in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation and the fact that Alice didn't accept my previous offer, I'll try to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of the money for me.

{""bob_gain"": 52.5,
""alice_gain"": 47.5,
""message"": ""Meeting halfway between our last offers, considering inflation.""}"
