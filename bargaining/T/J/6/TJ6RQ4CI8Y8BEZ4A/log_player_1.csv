"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'm considering the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation. So, the effective value of my gain is 90% of $400,000, which is $360,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share of the money to compensate for the inflation."
