I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, but leaves Bob with something, hoping to get the game finished quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer to get more money, I have to be realistic. Inflation is working against me, and each round I risk getting less.  50/50 is a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
