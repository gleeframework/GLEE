{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take 900,000 for myself and give Bob 100,000. This feels like a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it seems like a good deal now, I'm banking on the fact that the inflation will continue to work in my favor if we keep going.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000 and keeping 800,000 for myself.  I'm reducing my offer, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal before the inflation gets too severe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take what I can get, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. With the inflation continuing, the value of the money is decreasing significantly, so it's in my best interest to keep pushing for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and taking 600,000 for myself.  I'm still trying to get a good deal while the inflation is eating away at the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering an even split this time. The inflation is getting out of control, and it's becoming clear that we both need to compromise if we want to get anything at all.  Let's split the money evenly and call it a day."
