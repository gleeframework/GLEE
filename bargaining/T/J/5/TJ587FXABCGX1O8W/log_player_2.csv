Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before it's too late, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in Round 3 is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (36% decrease already!).  Waiting any longer significantly hurts my potential gains.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is likely aware that the longer the game goes on, the more the inflation benefits her. She's unlikely to offer significantly more. 
* **Something is better than nothing:** Rejecting this offer means I risk getting even less in Round 4, where the value decreases even further. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting now cuts my losses and guarantees I at least get something."
