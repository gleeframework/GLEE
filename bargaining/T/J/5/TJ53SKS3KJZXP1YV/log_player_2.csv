"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take $7500 and you'll receive $2500. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob and I want a bigger share! I'll see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think it's more fair to split the money closer to 50/50. I'm offering $5500 for myself and $4500 for you. Let's make a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the value of money decreases with each round, I propose we divide the funds as $6000 for me and $4000 for you. Let's aim for a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the value of my share is decreasing rapidly. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and the next round might leave me with nothing."
