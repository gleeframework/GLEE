"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000. We can discuss further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing each round.  Let's make this quick and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. Considering the value of the money is decreasing each round, I think his offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll accept this offer to avoid further inflation.
