"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm taking the bigger share, but you still get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the inflation that affects both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice in each round, it's in both of our interests to come to an agreement sooner rather than later. By offering Alice $600,000 and taking $400,000 for myself, I'm hoping we can find a mutually acceptable solution before the value of the money drops further. Your turn, Alice!"
