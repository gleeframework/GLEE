"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a division of 9000$ for me and 1000$ for Bob. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer ensures I gain something, even with the inflation. Rejecting could lead to me getting nothing in future rounds, especially with the possibility of Bob also facing some inflation."
