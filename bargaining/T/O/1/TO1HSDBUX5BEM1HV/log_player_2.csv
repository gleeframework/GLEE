"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take most of it this round but we can work something out for the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1000,  it's not a good long-term strategy.  Alice is taking the vast majority of the money, and the inflation will hurt her more. This is an opportunity to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a fair share, and we can work out a more balanced split in the future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from the last offer. We can adjust further in the future. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has offered a much more balanced split, and even though the money is worth less due to inflation, it's a good deal compared to her previous offer.  It's a good starting point for negotiations in future rounds."
