"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll have to decide...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems to be taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...
