"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob.  A 60/40 split seems fair to kick things off. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Since inflation hits Alice much harder, I might be able to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a more equitable starting point, given the different inflation rates we face.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. How about a 55/45 split?  It acknowledges the inflation difference while still being a reasonable division. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While Alice has adjusted her offer to account for inflation, I'm still holding out for a larger share. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since inflation is hitting Alice significantly harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still feeling the effects of inflation.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. While it might seem aggressive, it takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both of us.  Let's work towards a solution that minimizes our individual losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting both of us, and the longer this drags on, the less we both get.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's just take it and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable.  Inflation is hitting Alice hard, and a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. It's better to take what we can get than risk losing everything due to further inflation."
