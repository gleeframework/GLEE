"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get our fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation, but I'll assume it's not.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain of $30 is worth only 30.4% of what it was in the first round (100% - 69.6% = 30.4%). I'm not sure if Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but I'll assume it is.

Considering the offer, I'll reject it since it's not as favorable to me as my previous offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.
