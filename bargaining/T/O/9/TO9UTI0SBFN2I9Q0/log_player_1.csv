"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, hoping to get a good starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be strategic.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $6,000 and call it a day, hoping it's a good compromise."
