"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to give Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'd like to make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering to give Bob $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

After considering Bob's new offer, I think I'll accept this one. It's not the best offer I've seen, but it's better than the previous ones.
