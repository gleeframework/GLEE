"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll get $40 - 10% of $40 = $36.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
