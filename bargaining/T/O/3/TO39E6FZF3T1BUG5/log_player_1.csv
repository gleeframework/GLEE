"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to keep things friendly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob gain: 6000 * 0.95 = 5700

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as I'd like. I'll wait for the next round to make my next proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the proposal this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, as I'm mirroring Bob's message from the previous round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 2500 * 0.516 = 1292
Bob gain: 7500 * 0.857 = 6438.75

I'll reject this offer since it's still not favorable to me. I'll wait for the next round to make my next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to avoid a stalemate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $7,000 and keeping $3,000 for myself. The message reflects my growing urgency to reach a deal!"
