"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split.  We both have a lot of rounds to go, and while the value of money decreases, it's still better than getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
