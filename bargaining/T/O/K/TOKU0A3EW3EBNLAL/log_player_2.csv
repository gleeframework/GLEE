"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make it worth my while. Let's split it 65/35. Take it or we'll be back to square one. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the inflation working against her. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
