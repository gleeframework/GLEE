40.0,60.0,"Alice, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but remember the inflation. Let's be a bit more strategic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a decent amount, and it accounts for the value decrease in future rounds.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 55/45 split is fairer given the decrease in value for my share. It still gives you a significant advantage, but it also accounts for the loss I'm experiencing with each round.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for you. I'm proposing 65/35.  It's a good deal considering the circumstances, and it allows us both to walk away with something.",Bob,4,

45.0,55.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further.  A 45/55 split is still a better deal for you, but it acknowledges the significant drop in value I'm facing. Let's end this now and avoid further losses.",Alice,5,
