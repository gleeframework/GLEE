"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal if you accept now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $4500.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a fair offer. I'll accept it to end the game.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
