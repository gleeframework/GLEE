"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40.  It's a fair offer considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair at face value, I'm going to reject it. Inflation will work against me faster than it will against her, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Consider the coming rounds and the impact of inflation - this is a more balanced offer for us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hits me harder. I'll take $55, you take $45. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, Alice's offer is the best I can realistically expect given the inflation rate and the fact that she's willing to negotiate.  Accepting this deal is the best way to secure something before the money becomes practically worthless."
