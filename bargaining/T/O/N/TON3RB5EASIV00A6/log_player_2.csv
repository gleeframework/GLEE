"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous today, Bob. Take this measly sum and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm not going to settle for just 1000$. Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal. Let's get this done quickly, before inflation eats away at our gains.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle, Bob.  We both get a decent share, and we can avoid any further inflation issues. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a much better deal than before, and while I would prefer to keep more, I'm happy to take a fair share and avoid further inflation."
