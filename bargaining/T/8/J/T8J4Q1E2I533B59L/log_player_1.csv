Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While I would prefer more, the inflation is hurting me significantly, and Bob is offering a reasonable compromise. Accepting is the best option at this point."
