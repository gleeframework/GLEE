"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. For Alice, the money loses 20% of its value each round, so she has an incentive to end the game sooner. I'll try to take advantage of this and get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round.""} \n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value for Alice each round, so I'm offering her a slightly smaller share in the hopes that she'll accept and end the game sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slight increase, but I need to get a better deal than that. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nAlice's offer is still not good enough for me. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can continue to negotiate for a better deal. Alice is under pressure to end the game sooner due to the 20% decrease in value each round, so I'll try to take advantage of this and get an even better offer. Alice's gain is now worth 36% less than the original amount, which means she's actually getting less value than the numbers suggest. I'll try to use this to my advantage and push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing a lot of value each round, so I think this is a fair compromise.""} \n\nI'm continuing to try to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value for Alice each round. Since she's now lost 36% of the value, I'm offering her an even smaller share in the hopes that she'll accept and end the game sooner rather than later. I'm trying to appear reasonable by framing it as a ""fair compromise"", but in reality, I'm trying to get the best deal possible for myself."
