Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement. Alice, on the other hand, is under pressure due to the devaluation of her potential gains.

# Bob gain: 57 
# Alice gain: 43 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer because it's relatively close to my previous proposal, and I don't think I can get a significantly better deal. Considering the current situation, this is a reasonable compromise. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm not under pressure, but I also don't want to risk Alice becoming more stubborn or the game ending without an agreement. This deal seems like a good middle ground, so I'll accept it.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game."
