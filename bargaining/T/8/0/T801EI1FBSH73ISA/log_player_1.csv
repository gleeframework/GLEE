"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth $48 (since it's 20% less than the original $70).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
