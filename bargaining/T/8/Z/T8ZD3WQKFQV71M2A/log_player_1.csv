"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money, but it's still a small amount for Bob, enough to potentially incentivize him to accept it in the first round.  I'm taking advantage of the fact that I'm the first to propose and that inflation will hurt him more than me in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and while it's less than I initially wanted, the potential for inflation in the next rounds means I could end up with significantly less. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good amount of money."
