"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm starting with a slightly higher offer for myself, considering the inflation factor that affects me. I want to convey a sense of fairness while also accounting for the decreasing value of money for me in subsequent rounds. This initial offer aims to set a baseline for negotiations, encouraging Bob to consider the impact of delay on my perception of the money's value. By suggesting a division that slightly favors me, I'm testing Bob's willingness to accept a compromise early on, which could benefit both of us by avoiding further devaluation of the money from my perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option and we can both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although it seems fair at face value, the inflation factor means I'm actually getting less value than Bob. Since the money is worth 10% less to me in this round compared to the first, an even split doesn't equate to equal value for both of us. I need to consider this depreciation in my decision-making to ensure I get a fair deal considering the game's conditions. By rejecting, I aim to negotiate a split that accounts for the decreasing value of the money from my perspective."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\nGiven the ongoing inflation, I've adjusted my offer to ensure I'm compensated for the loss in value. By increasing my share, I'm factoring in the 10% decrease from the first round and the additional 10% decrease in this round, aiming to maintain the value of my potential gain. This offer still provides Bob with a substantial amount, but it also reflects the changing value of money for me, making it a more balanced proposal under the current conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to make sure we both get something. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to give me a share, the offer doesn't adequately account for the significant decrease in value I've experienced due to inflation. At this point, the money is worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round, which means his offer of 45 is substantially lower in real value. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not getting a fair deal considering the game's conditions. I need to continue negotiating to try and reach a split that better reflects the impact of inflation on my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, need a better split.""}\n\nAs the game progresses and inflation continues to erode the value of my potential gain, I must adjust my offer to compensate for this loss. With the money now worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round, I've increased my share to 62 to try and maintain the real value of my gain. This offer is more aggressive than my previous ones, reflecting the growing impact of inflation on my decision-making. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the need for this adjustment and accept the offer, as further rounds will only exacerbate the issue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to make sure we both get something. Let's make a deal before inflation eats away more of our money! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his acknowledgment of the inflation issue, the offer still doesn't adequately account for the significant decrease in value I've experienced. With the money now worth 40.95% less to me than in the first round, his offer of 40 is even more insufficient in real value. Accepting this offer would mean I'm accepting a substantially unfair deal considering the game's conditions. I must continue to push for a split that better reflects the impact of inflation on my potential gain, even though the window for negotiation is narrowing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is severe, need a more drastic split.""}\n\nAs the game reaches its midpoint and inflation continues to severely erode the value of my potential gain, I've adjusted my offer to prioritize compensating for this loss. With the money now worth 40.95% less to me than in the first round, I've increased my share to 65 to try and salvage as much real value as possible. This offer is more aggressive than my previous ones, reflecting the critical impact of inflation on my decision-making. I'm urging Bob to recognize the urgency of the situation and accept this offer, as further rounds will only worsen the effects of inflation, risking the possibility of a satisfactory deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end. Let's make a deal, even if it means I get a bigger share, it's better than both of us getting nothing! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm at a point where the money is worth 52.17% less to me than in the first round, which drastically affects the real value of any offer. However, considering we're more than halfway through the rounds and the risk of ending up with nothing is increasing, I need to assess whether holding out for a better deal is worth the gamble. Given the significant disparity in how inflation affects us, Bob's offer, although seemingly unfair at face value, might actually be the best I can achieve under these conditions. Accepting this offer means I at least secure some value, albeit greatly diminished, rather than risking a total loss if negotiations fail in the remaining rounds. Thus, with a heavy consideration of the game's constraints and the looming deadline, I'm inclined to accept this offer as a pragmatic choice.
