I'm going to propose a pretty straightforward split. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm giving Bob a decent amount to start. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty insulting! He's basically flipped our proposed split. Even with inflation, I'm not going to accept this.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still going to aim for a larger share, but I'm lowering my demand slightly to try and find a compromise. With inflation hitting us harder, I need to make sure I get a good deal while still keeping Bob interested in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  Inflation is hurting me badly, but I'm still not going to accept such a drastically uneven split. Let's see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm getting desperate.  The money is losing value fast.  I'm lowering my demand again, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share.  I think this is a reasonable compromise.  Bob has been pretty stubborn, but maybe he'll finally see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the hefty inflation hitting us.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  Let's see if we can reach a better compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm really feeling the pressure now.  Inflation is making the money worth almost nothing.  I have to make a compromise.  I'm dropping my demand again, but I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to accept.  This is a fair split considering the circumstances."
