"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can discuss further.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm suggesting that I, Alice, get $90 and Bob gets $10. I'm framing it as a small difference to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I propose a 55/45 split.  We can both walk away with a decent amount, and it's a more balanced starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the numbers are:

* Alice's gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.9 = 49.5

I'm not too thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'd like to propose a more even split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so the numbers are:

* Alice's gain: 40.5 * 0.9 = 36.45
* Bob's gain: 49.5 * 0.9 = 44.55

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50/50 split is fair and simple.""
}
```"
