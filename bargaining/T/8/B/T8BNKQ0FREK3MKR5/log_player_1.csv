"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the first to make a proposal. I'm aiming for a large share but leaving a little for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is very unfair, and while the inflation hurts, it doesn't make this offer acceptable. I will counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I propose a 45/55 split.  This is a more equitable offer than Bob's last proposal.  While inflation is affecting the value of my share, I believe this offer is still fair and will incentivize Bob to accept, especially considering the potential for further rounds and continued inflation."
