I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money.  I figure I can get a good deal since I have the first move.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is a bit insulting!  I'll reject it and see what kind of counter-proposal he comes up with in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer, but I'm still keeping the majority share. I'm hoping that Bob realizes that the longer we wait, the less valuable the money will be for both of us."
