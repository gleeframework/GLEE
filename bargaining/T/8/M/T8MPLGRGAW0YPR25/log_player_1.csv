"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous this round, let's go 65-35! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, but I'm not buying it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. The 65-35 split is not favorable to me, and I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split this time, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
