"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split fairly reflects the fact that the money loses value more quickly for me.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the same offer I made in the first round.  While the money is losing value for both of us, it's clear that the impact is greater for me.  I'm aiming for a fair resolution, and this split still makes the most sense given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that the money is losing value more rapidly for her, the fact that we're now in round 3 makes her offer even less appealing. I'm banking on her understanding that the longer this goes on, the less valuable the entire sum becomes.  I need to signal I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement. This offer reflects the urgency of the situation while still acknowledging your initial proposal. Let's close this out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  By round 4, the total value has significantly shrunk. It's crucial to settle quickly.
* **Concession:** The offer is a slight increase for Alice from my previous proposal, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes wrapping up the negotiation."
