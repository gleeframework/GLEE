"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up 50% of the money. This is a 60/40 split in my favor. If you reject this, I'm sure you'll regret it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, time is working against me more than her.  However, accepting only 40% when I could have had 75% just last round is a big loss. I need to try and push her further while making it clear that a deal now is better than risking larger losses for both of us."
