I'm taking a big chunk for myself, but I'm leaving Bob with something. Hopefully, that's enough to get him to accept in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not happy with this offer. It's a huge decrease from the first round, and while the inflation is a factor, I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share a bit more to try to find a middle ground, but still keeping a significant majority. Inflation is hitting my potential gains, and I need to secure a good portion before it drops further."
