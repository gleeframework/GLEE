Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split it 50/50.  This is fair, and it avoids any further risk of inflation hurting us both. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
