"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm starting by rejecting Alice's offer. While it's a reasonable starting point, I want to see if I can secure a more favorable split considering Alice's increasing inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe this split is fairer given the escalating inflation.  Let's reach an agreement before the value of our shares diminishes further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but we need to find a middle ground. This offer ensures a fairer split considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still prefer a larger share, I believe this offer is a good compromise given the escalating inflation. Accepting allows us to divide the money before it becomes worthless for Alice."
