"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm going for a large share. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. It's unfair to me, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic imbalance in the split. Let's see what Bob proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to 70/30. This is a compromise, and I hope Bob will see it as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While Bob is adjusting his offer, it's still incredibly lopsided.  I'm not giving up yet; I'm confident we can find a more fair split. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Given the inflation and the fact that we're getting closer to the deadline, it's time to find a solution that's fair to both of us. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
