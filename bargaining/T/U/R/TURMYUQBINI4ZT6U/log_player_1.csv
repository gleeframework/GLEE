"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting the larger share. I figure this is a fair starting point, given the inflation rates favor me in the later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best move. I'm already losing 20% of my money with each round, and Bob's offer still gives me a decent sum.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later."
