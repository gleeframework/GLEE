"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a very generous starting point, Alice, but hardly fair. How about a 60/40 split?  It benefits us both to settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
