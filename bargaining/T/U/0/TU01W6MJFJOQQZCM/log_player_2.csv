"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet a bit closer to the middle? It's better to agree now than to risk losing more with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting this offer seems prudent. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for me, making this option more favorable."
