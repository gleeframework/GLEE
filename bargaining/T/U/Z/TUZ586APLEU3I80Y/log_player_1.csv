"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. This leaves me with $60, which I think is a fair share considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, and I'm getting 40% of the remaining amount, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get:

$100 x 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = $80
$80 x 0.4 (40% of the remaining amount) = $32

As for Bob's offer, he's proposing that I get $40 and he gets $60. Since the money is worth 10% less for him, his share would be:

$60 x 0.9 (10% less due to inflation) = $54

Considering my calculation, I think I'd be better off accepting Bob's offer, as I'd get $32 from my own proposal, but $40 from Bob's offer. So, I'll:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
