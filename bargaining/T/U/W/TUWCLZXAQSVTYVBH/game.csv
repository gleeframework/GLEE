55.0,45.0,Let's start fair! I propose we split the money 55-45.  It's a good starting point. What do you think?,Alice,1,

48.0,52.0,"Let's try a bit more in my favor, 52-48 is still quite fair!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,I'm not keen on losing more money. Let's go back to a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option and prevents further losses due to inflation. What do you say?,Alice,3,
