"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is my initial offer. I believe it is a fair split, considering the slight advantage Bob will get in future rounds due to the lower inflation rate. I am hoping he will accept it and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation rate means that my share of the money will be worth significantly less if we proceed to another round.  I believe it is in my best interest to accept this offer and end the game."
